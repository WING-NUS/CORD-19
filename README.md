# WING-NUS CORD-19
With the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic all over the world, in-depth knowledge is desperately needed for the development of successful vaccines. Online academic and non-academic articles, therefore, play a crucial role in facilitating research work with needed insights.

Although many papers are published online every day, some of them are not reliable. As research has shown, thirty percent of the articles are known as preprint papers which are put out to the public before the peer-review process. This makes it hard to locate rigorous sources of knowledge. Furthermore, it is technically impossible to summarise useful information from every article within a limited time.

WING-NUS COVID-19 is a web scientific document tool that helps scientists decipher important information from floods of coronavirus research online, It uses a modern scientific document processing system, SciWING from NUS-WING to facilitate abstract and named entity tagging and section analyses.

This website uses the AUEB NLP Group Search Engine to retrieve relevant documents and sentences to perform further document analysis. You can use WING-NUS COVID-19 to facilitate your understanding of COVID-19. It also provides a 2D comparison to help you drill down on articles matching filters by their publication time.
