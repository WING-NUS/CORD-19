        "Molecular Mechanism of Action of Repurposed Drugs and Traditional Chinese Medicine Used for the Treatment of Patients Infected With COVID-19: A Systematic Review",
        "At this moment, the therapeutic approaches to handle COVID-19 are only supportive.",
        "There is neither a vaccine to prevent infections nor clinically approved antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19; therefore, identifying drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for responding to the pandemic.",
        "Clinical trials for vaccines are currently underway.",
        "Potential vaccines have been administered to volunteers in a phase 1 safety trial by the USA government; however, the efficacy, such as how long immunity will last or if people might become infected even if they possess a high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, will not become clear for at least one year after injection [16] .",
        "Furthermore, the safety of the developed vaccines is unknown because laboratory tests are being conducted in parallel to clinical trial phase 1 owing to the emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic.",
        "The unknown efficacy and safety of the vaccines used might cause disease enhancement, by which vaccinated subjects might develop an even more severe form of disease than the subjects that have not been vaccinated, which has been shown in studies of SARS vaccines, in which vaccinated ferrets developed damaging inflammation in their livers after they were infected with the virus [17] .",
        "Until now, no drugs have been successfully developed for the control of COVID-19 [18] ; however, numerous effort are underway worldwide, and particularly in China [19] .",
        "Therefore, drug repurposing and the use of existing alternative medicine have been used as effective methods for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.",
        "In this comprehensive review, we reviewed the use of existing drugs or alternative treatment methods and discussed the mode of action from a molecular mechanism perspective to attenuate COVID-19 in the human system."

          "Transposable elements (TEs) are segments of DNA with the ability to relocate within or between genomes, which is conferred by the element-encoded enzymatic functions. Traditionally, TEs are divided into two major classes: class I (retrotransposons) code for a reverse transcriptase (RT) capable of making a cDNA copy of the template RNA, which serves as a transposition intermediate; and class II (DNA TEs) code for a transposase, which can mobilize DNA in the absence of RNA intermediates (Finnegan 1989; Wicker et al. 2007; Kapitonov and Jurka 2008) . Retrotransposons are in turn subdivided into four subclasses: LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons, which are closely related to retroviruses; nonLTR retrotransposons, also called LINEs; DIRS, or YR-retrotransposons; and Penelope-like elements (PLEs). These subclasses are phylogenetically distinct, and their RTs usually operate together with the respective types of coencoded phosphotransferase/endonuclease (EN) DNAcleaving enzymes: IN (DDE-integrase); APE (apurinic-apyrimidinic EN) or REL (restriction enzyme-like EN); YR (tyrosine recombinase); and GIY-YIG (nickase initially identified in prokaryotic group I introns). It is the concerted action of the RT and the phosphotransferase that determines the retroelement's ability to insert into internal genomic locations. Enzymatically active domains are typically fused into a single polyprotein called pol, which may undergo proteolytic processing or function as a multi-domain protein. Formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle is ensured by the structural ORF1 (gag), which is usually separated from the downstream ORF2 (pol) by a programmed ribosomal frameshift or by inframe stop codons. Downstream of pol, many retrovirus-like TEs have incorporated env genes of various origins coding for envelope glycoproteins responsible for membrane fusion and interaction with cell surface receptors during viral entry and egress. Two families of RT-containing viruses, hepadnaviruses and caulimoviruses (collectively called pararetroviruses), differ from retroviruses in encapsidating their DNA instead of RNA, and do not regularly integrate into chromosomes (Glebe and Bremer 2013; Hohn and Rothnie 2013) .",
          "Penelope-like elements (PLEs) are an enigmatic group of retroelements whose RTs share a common ancestor with telomerase reverse transcriptases (TERTs) (Arkhipova et al. 2003) . Canonical PLEs are 3-4 kilobases (kb) in length; are framed by terminal repeats called pLTRs, which may be either direct or inverted; encode an RT with a C-terminal GIY-YIG EN domain; and yield target-site duplications (TSD) of variable length upon insertion (Evgen'ev and Arkhipova 2005) . Of special interest is the unique group of PLE RTs named Athena (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) . Previously described Athena retroelements are 4-6 kb in length; are phylogenetically distinct from canonical Penelope RTs; do not carry EN domains; and contain stretches of telomeric repeats at the junctions with host DNA. Such EN-deficient RTs are found at or near telomeres in many basidiomycete fungi and in a few plants and protists, but are particularly abundant at telomeres of bdelloid rotifers (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) .",
          "Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic freshwater invertebrates that reproduce clonally, are highly resistant to desiccation and ionizing radiation, and contain numerous horizontally transferred genes in their genomes Mark Welch et al. 2008) . Genome sequencing of the first bdelloid representative, Adineta vaga, revealed that over 8% of its genes originate from bacteria, fungi, plants, or protists (Flot et al. 2013) . Known TE families make up over 3% of the A. vaga genome, and are characterized by low copy numbers and high family diversity. Recently, we described canonical Penelope retrotransposons from A. vaga, which integrate into internal chromosomal locations with the aid of the C-terminal GIY-YIG EN domain ). Here we investigate Athena-containing retroelements in A. vaga, compare their organization in related species separated by tens of millions of years, and discover that they possess an extraordinarily complex structure not yet described in retroelements. We also uncover the basis for their affinity to telomeres and identify putative cisacting elements that may play a role in mobilizing genes of foreign origin and members of multigene families.",
          "We first sought to verify the boundaries of Athena retroelements in the A. vaga genome assembly. The commonly used TE detection pipelines perform poorly on A. vaga due to overabundance of low-copy-number families with one or two members (Flot et al. 2013) . Most of the computergenerated Athena consensi were represented by RT and some adjacent sequences, but their boundary verification was far from straightforward. Specifically, while the 3 0 boundary, at least in some families, was relatively easy to define from comparison between inserts, the 5 0 boundaries were mostly formed by variably positioned 5 0 -truncations of apparently longer units, which included a variety of ORFs shared by some families but different in others. All other bdelloid TEs (LTR, nonLTR, DNA TEs) form well-defined host-TE boundaries (Flot et al. 2013) .",
          "To facilitate boundary definition, we employed small RNA coverage as a proxy for delimiting host-TE junctions (El Baidouri et al. 2015) . Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small RNAs typically expressed from specialized loci termed piRNA clusters, which in many genomes are composed of multiple adjacent TEs or their fragments, and ensure silencing of homologous TEs in the germ line (Weick and Miska 2014) . Our piRNA libraries, as expected, were highly enriched in known A. vaga TEs (Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016). Notably, for most Athena RTs, we observed that piRNA coverage extends well beyond the RT ORF ( fig. 1 ). However, inspection of RT flanks did not reveal any sequences that might correspond to adjacent TEs in a piRNA cluster. Instead, the zone of piRNA coverage includes a multitude of densely spaced ORFs, which display the same polarity as Athena RTs, and apparently constitute parts of very large transposable units.",
          "The most surprising observation is the length of these units, which can exceed 40 kb, far more than any of the known retroelement types. A highly variable and diversified gene content is also not typical of retroelements, which display relatively simple and well-defined ORF composition (e.g., gag-pol-env in LTR retrotransposons, or gag-pol in nonLTR retrotransposons). Collectively, these observations indicate that Athena-containing units represent a previously undescribed type of TEs, and justify further inquiry into their characteristics. 5 0 -and 3 0 -Boundaries Define the Giant Terminon Units",
          "In three previously described Athena families, the 3 0 -and 5 0boundaries were formed by short stretches of species-specific reverse-complement telomeric repeats (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) . A genome-wide inventory of host-TE boundaries near Athena-like RTs in A. vaga reveals that, although the immediate RT environment does not always include such repeats, they are invariably found at the actual TE-host junction (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online). In other words, the RT is not always positioned near the 3 0 -end of the entire unit, so that a series of intervening ORFs may appear between the RT and telomeric repeats at the host-TE boundary. The 5 0 -boundaries in most cases are also formed by stretches of telomeric repeats capping 5 0 -terminally truncated copies. The Athena-M family is somewhat of an exception: out of six contigs, only one had (ACACCC) 2 at the junction between the 3 0 -pLTR and the downstream Athena-M copy (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online).",
          "Since terminal addition is the only plausible mechanism that can account for the presence of telomeric repeats at both 3 0 -and 5 0 -termini (see below and Discussion), we further refer to the giant Athena-containing transposable units as Terminons, reflecting their capacity to attach to chromosome ends. Indeed, we were unable to find a TE or a host gene interrupted by a Terminon insertion. On the contrary, we observed multiple cases in which part of a preexisting TE or gene was irreversibly lost by truncation, with subsequent addition of telomeric repeats and Terminon attachment (supplementary table S1 and figs. S1A and S6, Supplementary Material online). Remarkably, the added Terminon units can extend telomeres by tens of kb at a time. Such additions can effectively counteract the ongoing terminal erosion, the dynamic nature of which is seen from comparison of the same A. vaga telomere at different points in time: telomere M1 (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) The 3 0 ends of Terminons are often present in higher copy numbers than the 5 0 ends, a pattern observed in nonLTR retrotransposons, which display well-defined 3 0 ends and frequent 5 0 -truncations (Wei et al. 2001; Hayashi et al. 2014) . As seen in supplementary figure S2, Supplementary Material online, intragenomic Terminon replication follows the mastercopy model, whereby shorter copies are derived from the longest resident copy. Indeed, WJ and W2 families propagated a subset of internally deleted copies, which is indicative of trans-complementation.",
          "To classify families with highly variable gene content, we relied on phylogenetic relationships of the element-encoded RTs, which are the longest and the most conserved ORFs in each unit. The phylogram in figure , which lack essential catalytic residues, and are colocalized on the same unit with a catalytically intact RTs (W, N, S/T, or K). Interestingly, Athena RTs from Philodina roseola, a species from the bdelloid family Philodinidae (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) , can be confidently placed into N and W clades defined by RTs from A. vaga (supplementary fig. S3A , Supplementary Material online), indicating that the split between clades predates the divergence of bdelloid families (>60 Mya) (Mark Welch et al. 2008) . Table 1 presents the inventory of A. vaga families, with the scaffold harboring the longest and most intact representative designated as the reference scaffold for each family. Members of each family share common features and display betweenclade variability in the RT ORF structure, manifested in the presence/absence of programmed ribosomal frameshifts, commonly found in retrovirus-like elements; gain and loss of introns; and acquisition of RT derivatives lacking catalytic residues.",
          "All members of the ILOM clade are characterized by a À1 programmed ribosomal frameshift, allowing the RT to be Giant Retrotransposons at Telomeres . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE expressed as a fusion with ORF1, which mostly consists of coiled-coil (CC) motifs. The À1 frameshift has a canonical structure, formed by a heptanucleotide \"slippery sequence\" (typically T 6 G or T 6 C, translating into consecutive Phe residues), and a downstream pseudoknot or hairpin (Caliskan et al. 2015 ",
          "Unlike other retroelements, PLEs, especially Athenas, possess an unusual ability to accumulate and retain spliceosomal introns (Arkhipova et al. 2003) . Members of the NT clade have accumulated the largest number of introns, harboring 4-9 introns each (supplementary figs. S3A and S5, Supplementary Material online). Intron positions are highly conserved in the core motifs RT1-2 and RT5 (Xiong and Eickbush 1990) , and an additional intron appears in the conserved NGY motif of the RT thumb domain in the NT clade. Members of the W clade have the frameshift and either 2 or 4 introns. In the JVX clade, V and X have the frameshift and either one (V) or two (X) introns, while J lacks frameshifts and contains 2 or 4 introns. Even in the poorly conserved N-terminal (ORF1) moiety, one of the intron positions is conserved between JVX, W, and NT clades, while two other positions are specific either for NT clade or for J/W clades (supplementary figs. S3 and S7, Supplementary Material online). Intron acquisition can be followed by occasional intron losses, as follows from the intron presence-absence mapping on the phylogenetic tree (supplementary fig. S3A , Supplementary Material online). All members of the frameshifted ILOM clade are intronless. ",
          "In the JVX clade, Athena-derived ORFs are characterized by complete loss of the RT catalytic residues: the core palm motifs RT3-5 (or A-C), encompassing the DDD catalytic triad, along with finger motifs RT1-2, are wiped out in the context of an otherwise intact, intron-containing ORF, rendering the RT domain catalytically inactive (supplementary fig. S5 , Supplementary Material online). While their roles evidently cannot involve catalysis, these RT derivatives should have the potential to interact with a catalytically active RT (from W or N/T clades), which is usually present on the same unit (see below). The highly diverse Y clade (supplementary fig. S3A , Supplementary Material online) entirely lacks the Nterminus corresponding to ORF1, and contains barely recognizable RT derivatives.",
          "In each Terminon family, RTs and the associated CC-ORFs represent the obligatory components of these units (table 1; Overall, each Terminon family is characterized by a core set of genes, all of which, however, are not necessarily present in each family (table 1) Such unidirectionality facilitates rapid assessment of Terminon boundaries at-a-glance, since the ORFs in the adjacent host DNA are distributed between Watson and Crick strands. The enzymatic potential of extra ORFs is described in the next section.",
          "DEDDy/DEDDh Single-Stranded 3 0 -Exonucleases Eight Terminon families (table 1) contain ORFs with homology to the DEDD-type (or DnaQ-like) 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease domain, which has three conserved sequence motifs (ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII) with four acidic residues serving as ligands for the two metal ions required for catalysis (Zuo and Deutcher 2001) . Two variants of the ExoIII motif are known: YX 3 D (DEDYD) and HX 4 D (DEDHD). These exonucleases perform 3 0 -end processing of structured RNAs (RNase D, RNase T, exosome subunit Rrp6), but may also act on singlestranded DNAs (WRN, DnaQ, and proofreading subunits of A-and B-type DNA polymerases). Six of the Terminonencoded exonucleases are of the DEDYD-type, with the second D replaced with E (DEEYD); the remaining three derivatives in L1-L3 families lack the acidic residues, indicating catalytic inactivity. An additional EHCHC motif in all families, which is known to coordinate Zn 2þ binding in Maelstrom proteins involved in piRNA biogenesis (Chen et al. 2015) , suggests conservation of the RNA binding function. DEDDy exonucleases (ExoN) have also been found in nidoviruses, and were hypothesized to have a proofreading function in these large (þ)ssRNA viruses (Ulferts and Ziebuhr 2014) . Both DEDDy-like and GDSL-like Terminon ORFs exhibit similarity to ORF3's in bdelloid LTR retrotransposons (Rodriguez et al. 2017) .",
          "GDSL Esterases of the SGNH Hydrolase Family GDSL esterases/lipases are hydrolytic enzymes with broad substrate specificity (Akoh et al. 2004) . They contain five conserved blocks with a G-D-S-L or similar sequence with the catalytic Ser in the first block, and are also called SGNH hydrolases, after the letters specifying the invariant catalytic S, G, N, and H residues in the conserved blocks I, II, II, and V, respectively. Most members of the L1-L3 families encode these ORFs (table 1) , which are similar to PC-esterases (pfam13839), enzymes predicted to have acyl esterase activity modifying cell-surface biopolymers such as glycans and glycoproteins (Anantharaman and Aravind 2010). However, the hydrolytic function of these ORFs must be impaired, as the Ser residues of the catalytic S-N-H triad are lacking. GDSLesterase-like ORFs in a subset of nonLTR retrotransposons (CR1, RTEX, and BRIDGE1), which differ from PC-esterases, are thought to interact with membrane glycoproteins to facilitate entry or exit (Kapitonov and Jurka 2003; Schneider et al. 2013) , and at least some of them possess hydrolytic activity, while others lack such activity but preserve binding properties (Montanier et al. 2009 ). In the viral world, analogous ORFs encode hemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoproteins in ssRNA viruses, for example, orthomyxoviruses (influenza C) and coronaviruses (Zeng et al. 2008) . Notably, the GDSL domain is found in the I family as an integral part of ORF1, although it may also lack catalytic activity (supplementary figs. S5 and S6D, Supplementary Material online).",
          "GIY-YIG EN are nickases, with a single active site that hydrolyzes DNA by a one-metal ion mechanism, but can also generate double-strand breaks if DNA is nicked sequentially (Kleinstiver et al. 2013 (Kowalski et al. 1999) , and is framed by N-and C-terminal extensions averaging 300 and 130 aa, respectively. This arrangement does not match any of the known domain architectures, in which the GIY-YIG domain exhibits strong N-terminal preference. While the Nand C-terminal extensions lack known motifs, a characteristic arrangement of Cys residues (CX 2-4 CX 2 CX 33-35 CX 2 CX 10 CXCX 59-63 HX 3 C), with a CXC motif embedded within the GIY-YIG motif, partially matches that in the PLE Neptune clade, where it is found between RT and EN (Arkhipova 2006) . While this array of Cys residues does not match known Zn-finger-like profiles, it could still play a role in DNA binding, or form S-S bridges.",

          "Coiled-Coil Motif-Containing ORFs (CC-ORFs) Table 1 shows the nearly universal occurrence of CC-ORFs in the families prone to expansion (W and NT clades in fig. 2 ).",
          "Most of the numerous CC-ORFs, which are 400-500 aa in Arkhipova et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE length and occur as stand-alone coding sequences on either side of Athena RTs, exhibit similarity to the N-terminal moieties of RTs (equivalent to ORF1 in the frameshifted W and VX clades). The extreme N-terminus of RTs is clade-specific and comes in three variants (supplementary fig. S7A and B, Supplementary Material online). In the ILOM clade, it contains an excess of polar (S, T, Q, N, and Y) with some basic (K and R) residues. In the catalytically dead JVX clade, it displays a high content of acidic residues (D and E) at the N-termini, and weak matches to BAR domains sensing membrane curvature (pfam03114). In the intron-rich, catalytically intact NT and W clades, it carries a conserved N-terminal KR-rich motif with an adjacent region of weak homology to helix-turn-helix dsDNA-binding motifs, while the central core occasionally shows similarity to DnaJ chaperones and surface antigens . While ORF1's and CC-ORFs do not resemble classical orthoretroviral gag genes and lack Zn-knuckles, they are reminiscent of the gag genes forming nucleocapsids in foamy viruses (Spumaretrovirinae), which are similarly sized, do not undergo proteolytic processing, and contain up to four coiled-coil motifs (Goldstone et al. 2013; Mullers 2013) . A combination of KR-rich and DE-rich N-termini in cooccurring CC-ORFs is highly likely to affect RNP properties, and might aid in raising the limits on RNA packaging.",
          "TM-ORFs are found in 12 Terminon families (table 1) and are typically small (200-300 aa in length), with one (or rarely two) predicted TM domain of type I membrane topology (singlepass N-exo/C-cyt). Some of these ORFs also contain a predicted coiled-coil motif and/or cysteine residues which may form disulfide bridges. The low conservation of TM-ORFs offers limited insight into their function other than possible interaction with membranes. We searched for HHR motifs in A. vaga genomic DNA with the parameters used in (Cervera and De la Pena 2014), which were based on empirical criteria and tested on datasets of functionally active HHRs. A total of 497 HHR motifs fitting these descriptors were detected in A. vaga scaffolds, and assigned to M, O, W1, N, Q, R, S, and T families. Inspection of the remaining families revealed the essential core motifs (CUGANGA. . .GAAA) in the L and W families, albeit with a slightly different spacing (a much longer loop 2) ( fig. 3A ). When we modified the descriptor to accommodate these families, HHR-like motifs were detected in all PLE families, except for K, W2, and P. However, all members of the K, W2, and P families contain substitutions in the core HHR motif, although the sequence can easily be aligned with other HHRs and apparently preserves the structural helices ( (Lünse et al. 2016) , the AvPen3a HHR functions as a monomer.",
          "The HHR-bearing repeats represent the most conserved region of the pLTRs, possibly reflecting their role as cis-acting elements for 3 0 -end recognition by RT, analogous to 3 0 -end stem-loop recognition in LINEs (Hayashi et al. 2014) . Such cisacting elements could participate in trans-mobilization of genic regions unrelated to Terminons, as seen in examples shown in figure 1 and supplementary figure S1 , Supplementary Material online. While the variable nature of 5 0 -termini and the lack of TSDs precludes unambiguous identification of such transduction events, it is noteworthy that foreign genes and members of host multigene families are often colocalized with telomeric repeats and HHRs, as are Terminon ORFs (see below).",
          "The HHR motif can be positioned within pLTRs in two ways: intron-containing clades (NT-W) harbor the HHR motif near the 3 0 -end, with telomeric repeats directly adjacent to helix I ( fig. 3A , type I.t), while the intron-less families (L,O,M) carry the HHR motif in the 5 0 -terminal part of the pLTR, as do canonical Penelope elements. Note that helix I is the outermost helix of the type I HHR fold, and the expected cleavage site is always located in the center of the HHR, never coinciding with the TE-host boundary.",
          "The putative Rep-associated origins of replication represent yet another type of cis-acting elements often found near fulllength Rep ORFs. They usually consist of a hairpin structure ( fig. 1) , often in combination with a series of tandem repeats, which are reminiscent of \"iterons\" in geminiviruses and contribute to the specificity of Rep binding to the hairpin (Londono et al. 2010) . Such sequences often mark the point separating two divergent ORFs, as seen in geminiviruses (Hanley-Bowdoin et al. 2013 ).",
          "The directionality of ORFs within each unit ( fig. 1 and sup plementary figs. S2 and S6, Supplementary Material online) implies that transcript continuity is important for function, and distinguishes Terminons from self-synthesizing Polintons/ Mavericks, a class of virus-like DNA TEs of comparable size (15-20 kb, encoding up to ten ORFs in both orientations) (Kapitonov and Jurka 2006; Pritham et al. 2007) . Such ORF unidirectionality is typical for retroelements, but not for DNA TEs. Spacing between Terminon ORFs can be very close, consistent with residing on a single long transcript rather than on individual transcriptional units.",
          "Except for directionality, ORFs in different families are not arranged in any predetermined order, which often makes We did not detect internal capture of host genes within boundaries of any of the A. vaga Terminon units: if a Terminon sequence is interrupted, it is usually by insertion of a different TE type (LTR, nonLTR, or DNA TEs) (supplementary fig. S6 , Supplementary Material online). Neither could we find a known TE or host gene to be interrupted by Terminon insertion: if broken, TEs or host genes are subject to end healing by telomeric repeats followed by Terminon attachment, so that the missing gene part is not found at the other end of Terminons or elsewhere in the genome (as in examples shown in supplementary figs. S1A and S6, Supplementary Material online).",
          "Importantly, while foreign genes and host genes from multigene families are rarely internalized within units, they are often found between Terminons or their 3 0 -ends, either in direct or inverse orientation ( fig. 1 and supplementary fig.  S1C , Supplementary Material online). Thus, Terminons are likely to participate in gene amplification and transfer by providing cis-acting elements for transduction of genes via trans-action of the RT. Such complex structures could additionally propagate via rolling-circle replication, if combined with Rep origins of replication.",
          "Most of the Terminon families in A. vaga, as judged by RNAseq counts, exhibit measurable levels of transcriptional activity, which is largely anticorrelated with small RNA counts ( fig.  4A ). Members of the M, O, and W2 families could represent recent additions which have not yet established a robust piRNA response. It should be noted that Terminons are ideally suited for establishment of piRNA clusters (Weick and Miska 2014) . These genomic loci, which give rise to noncanonical Pol II transcripts processed into piRNAs, are characterized, inter alia, by extended transcript length and intron retention (Sapetschnig and Miska 2014; Chen et al. 2016) . Giant Retrotransposons at Telomeres . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE Furthermore, not only can Terminons generate long sensestrand transcripts, but many copies are flanked at the 3 0 -end by an adjacent host gene in antisense orientation (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) with the potential to provide a promoter for antisense transcription, which could stimulate formation of a dual-strand piRNA cluster (Sapetschnig and Miska 2014) . If a flanking gene is 3 0 -truncated by terminal erosion and loses transcription termination signals, the resulting transcriptional readthrough would yield antisense Terminon transcripts, and hence RNA-mediated silencing (Kowalik et al. 2015) .",
          "In earlier work, we amplified intron-containing Athena RT fragments by PCR of genomic DNA from representatives of three different bdelloid families, which diverged tens of millions of years ago (Mark Welch et al. 2008) : Philodina roseola (Philodinidae), Habrotrocha constricta (Habrotrochidae), and A. vaga (Adinetidae). These fragments can now be reliably assigned to W, K, and N Terminon clades. To evaluate the degree of Terminon conservation in bdelloids, we inspected sequenced cosmid inserts from P. roseola, as well as Athenacontaining contigs from a draft PacBio assembly of a natural isolate Adineta sp.11. In P. roseola, Terminons are joined to host DNA via a different telomeric repeat hexamer (TCACCC) n while in Adineta sp. 11 junctions are mostly formed by a variant octamer (TCACACCC) n . Strikingly, ORF composition and even syntenic blocks have been preserved in several families, and thus can be traced back to their common ancestor. For example, the extended ORF block in the S/T family, which includes the catalytically dead AthX and AthV (GIY-YIG, DEDDy, AthX, AthV, 2xGIY-YIG, CC JVX , AthT, aORF; supplementary fig. S6C , Supplementary Material online), appears in both Adineta spp., which diverged over 10 Mya, and phylogenetic analysis of Terminon ORFs confirms the presence of virtually every described family throughout each species' evolutionary history (supplementary fig. S3 , Supplementary Material online). Although nonRT Terminon-associated ORFs are shorter and less conserved than RTs, yielding less reliable branch support, their phylogeny is broadly congruent with the RT-based phylogeny, indicating that these ORFs have largely coevolved within each Terminon family (supplementary figs. S3B and S7, Supplementary Material online). The apparent exception is the Rep-related ORFs, for which a discordant phylogeny hints at the more transient character of their association with Terminons, albeit sufficiently prolonged to allow intron accumulation ( fig. 3C ). Overall, while the prevailing mode of inheritance for each Terminon family appears to be vertical, they may also persist within genera and species via horizontal mobility if a master copy is lost.",
          "To reinforce the connections between host gene relocation and Terminon addition observed in isolated examples ( fig. 1  and supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online), we sought to investigate statistically the correlations between TE families, foreign genes, and telomeric repeats in window sizes 10 kb. At such distances, the overall TE density in A.",
          "vaga was shown to be significantly higher around foreign genes, and vice versa (Flot et al. 2013) . We began by counting the number of telomeric repeats in windows of 2, 5, and 10 kb around each TE type. Using single-factor ANOVA (Tukey's test), we investigated distribution of telomeric repeats around different TE families for each window size. It is evident that the number of telomeric repeats is significantly higher near Athena RTs than near LTR, nonLTR, TIR, and Helitron elements, for window sizes ! 2kb ( fig. 4B and supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). Significant differences between Athena and Penelope start with the window size of 5 kb.",
          "Regarding HHR motifs, a clear association is again observed with PLEs but not any other TE type, with 508 out of 614 HHR counts showing the association ( fig. 4C ). HHR motifs also tend to occur close to foreign genes and host gene families with piRNA coverage, known to accumulate in the extended subtelomeric regions (Flot et al. 2013 ), but are almost never found near the bulk of host genes in the core genome ( fig.  4C ). Similar patterns are observed for telomeric repeats, which yield elevated counts near TEs and foreign genes, but low counts near the bulk of host genes ( fig. 4D ). Comparing Figure 4B and D, it is worth noting that accumulation of other TE types in subtelomeres is likely due to the reduced deleterious effects of their insertion in these regions.",
          "Notably, reinspection of our telomere-enriched mini-libraries from A. vaga and P. roseola (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) shows that over 50% of sequenced plasmid clones represented various parts of Terminons, although <20% were previously recognized as Athena-containing. Together with fluorescent in situ hybridization data localizing AthO/AthM-containing cosmids to P. roseola telomeres (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007) , our analysis underscores the capacity of Terminons to occupy terminal positions, forming multiple layers of \"sacrificial DNA\" at telomeres.",
          "For years, our knowledge of structural and functional TE diversity has remained relatively stable, with the understanding that we have largely grasped the major principles of their structural organization and the underlying basis for their mobility. It is therefore of special interest to identify taxonomic groups harboring hitherto unknown TE types. The principal subdivision between TEs rests upon the involvement of RNA into the replication cycle (class I TEs) or lack thereof (class II TEs). In class I autonomous TEs, the process of RNA copying into DNA requires that the TE codes for an RT, the enzyme capable of performing RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. On these grounds, the novel TEs described herein, named Terminons, can be unambiguously classified as retrotransposons. This, however, does not rule out the presence of enzymatic activities that may be involved in additional stages of the transposition cycle, which may even include rolling-circle replication. In total, the newly annotated Terminons occupy 1.1% of the A. vaga genome, increasing the known TE content from $3% (Flot et al. 2013 ) to slightly over 4%. Arkhipova et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE Molecular signatures around Terminons clearly point at terminal addition as the primary integration mechanism ( fig. 3D ). The characteristic 5 0 -truncation (supplementary fig. S2 , Supplementary Material online), which in nonLTR retrotransposons is often ascribed to premature RT fall-offs, in Terminons may also result from terminal DNA erosion, if the 5 0 -end is exposed to exonucleases before being capped by telomeric repeats. Long head-to-tail chains of sequentially added Terminons can exceed 60 kb in length, thereby greatly increasing the buffer zone that counteracts the ongoing terminal erosion. Site-specific integration into telomeric repeats, as observed in Bombyx mori for SART/TRAS retrotransposons (Fujiwara et al. 2005) , is highly unlikely, because Terminons are often found attached to terminally truncated and healed host genes or TEs. The observed bias towards oppositely oriented transcriptional units, especially 3 0 -truncated ones, could indicate a shift from uni-strand piRNA-producing loci known to operate in somatic tissues to dual-strand loci known to operate in the germ line, via antisense transcriptional units often lacking a proper poly(A) signal (Mohn et al. 2014; Weick and Miska 2014; Kowalik et al. 2015) . Members of the most prolific T family (supplementary figs. S2 and S6C, Supplementary Material online) have additionally incorporated a small transcriptionally active antisense ORF near the 3 0 end.",
          "Although Terminons can harbor a diverse set of enzymatic activities (table 1), none of these appear obligatory, except for RT itself, which is combined with CC-ORF of putatively structural nature. Some of the enzymatic ORFs (GIY-YIG, Rep) may have been recruited to facilitate transposition, while others (GDSL esterases; RNase D-like DEDDy exonucleases) may assist in RNP assembly and/or evading host defenses. It is of special interest that catalytically deficient ORFs derived from various enzymes are consistently found in Terminon units, often in combination with their catalytically intact counterparts, and have persisted throughout bdelloid evolution, indicating that their retention is not accidental. Moreover, those ORFs have evolved under purifying selection (data not shown), suggesting that their recruitment was not based on catalysis. Noncatalytic functions for such \"pseudoenzymes\" (Adrain and Freeman 2012) could be structural or regulatory, and may include utilization of their binding capabilities, or involvement in heteromeric complex formation. The observed difference in the extreme N-termini of KR-rich (NT/W-like) and DE-rich (JVX-like) ORFs, which carry strong positive and negative charges, respectively, could promote heteromeric complex formation, or the latter could act as nucleic acid decoys.",
          "Interestingly, Terminons do not encode any protease-like ORFs, indicating that the CC-RT fusion polyproteins are either processed by host proteases, or can form large multimeric complexes, where RT moieties belong to polypeptide chains up to 1.3 kDa. Neither do they code for an RNase H-like activity, which removes RNA from DNA-RNA hybrid intermediates in cytoplasmically replicating retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons, but is optional in nonLTR retrotransposons, which can utilize host RNase H for target-primed reverse transcription in the nucleus (Malik and Eickbush 2001) . The nonenzymatic CC-ORFs with coiled-coil motifs resemble in organization the gag proteins of certain reverse-transcribing viruses, which are dependent on eukaryotic cell membranes for their replication.",
          "Despite the presence of exceptionally complex Terminon retroelements in all examined members of the class Bdelloidea, separated by tens of millions of years of evolution, we could not find Athena-like RTs in draft genomes of rotifers of the sister class Monogononta, which contain canonical EN(þ) PLEs of the Neptune type (Arkhipova 2006; Arkhipova et al. 2013) . Neither could we find any extra ORFs in EN-deficient RTs of telomeric Coprina PLEs in numerous sequenced filamentous fungi, where they occur in tandem arrays (Gladyshev and Arkhipova 2007; Arkhipova et al. 2013) . Fungal EN(À) PLEs can be very efficient at terminal addition, occupying every telomere in some basidiomycetes, for example, Agaricus bisporus and Tuber melanosporum (Martin et al. 2010; Foulongne-Oriol et al. 2013) . These EN(À) PLEs code for a single nonframeshifted ca. 1000-aa CC-RT ORF, but have no additional coding capacities. Thus, terminal addition per se does not require an extended ORF repertoire, although telomeric placement is clearly associated with the HHR motifs and reversecomplement telomeric repeats, which in bdelloids are uniquely exposed next to the HHR fold for optimal annealing to G-rich overhangs ( fig. 3A and D) .",
          "Phylogenetic analysis of Athena RTs does not favor the scenario of shorter PLEs having evolved by reduction of longer ones. Rather, their phylogeny is more consistent with complex elements evolving from shorter ones via splitting of longer ORFs; acquisition of additional ORFs, possibly at the transcript level to account for coorientation; accumulation of introns; and loss of frameshifts. The L clade may serve as an example of recent expandability, as it still retains HHR remnants between neighboring ORFs (supplementary fig. S6D , Supplementary Material online). A split of ancestral elements into individual subdomains, perhaps by insertion of W-like ORFs, may have been accompanied by combination of elements with different subdomains, eventually giving rise to a highly complex structure preserving only one active RT compatible with a cognate HHR motif, which permits retrotransposition of the entire unit starting with HHR. The pLTR structure appears to have undergone a shift in HHR positioning relative to telomeric repeats (type I to type I.t; fig. 3A and D), which was likely selected to favor the optimal 3 0 -terminal configuration. Interestingly, a recent study associates HHR motifs with nonautonomous LTR retrotransposons, which may exist as short RNA circles (Cervera et al. 2016) ; however, all of those motifs belong to type III but not type I, differing in the topology of the open-ended helix, and possibly reflecting different structural requirements of PLE and LTR RTs.",
          "It may be asked whether the unique structural characteristics of these retroelements could be associated with any biological features specific to the class Bdelloidea. In our view, the most relevant biological feature is the unusual susceptibility of bdelloid telomeric regions to acquisition of foreign genetic material and amplification of foreign genes and host multigene families (Flot et al. 2013; Rodriguez and Arkhipova 2016) . PLEs are unique in their capacity to retain Giant Retrotransposons at Telomeres . doi:10.1093/molbev/msx159 MBE introns after retrotransposition, which is also applicable to genes captured between pLTRs (Arkhipova et al. 2003 . Retromobility of longer templates would be disfavored at internal chromosomal locations in the absence of a reliable integration mechanism, as it would largely depend on preexisting nicks or breaks. Bdelloid telomeres, however, apparently offer the opportunity to bypass intrachromosomal integration by supplying the exposed G-rich overhangs, and a TE which can take advantage of such overhangs for its proliferation can additionally provide the host with extra means of terminal DNA addition. The terminal attachment mode does not rule out occasional intrachromosomal integration events, which might be triggered by random DNA breakage or by the presumed nicking activity of GIY-YIG EN when present. However, such events would be rare in comparison with terminal addition, since the lack of RT-EN fusion eliminates the cis-preference effect based on cotranslational cis-recognition of structural elements near the 3 0 -end of the template by the RT.",
          "In summary, we have identified and characterized a novel and ancient type of retroelements with unusually complex organization and variable gene content, which can be added to telomeric G-rich overhangs with the aid of the 3 0 -terminally positioned hammerhead ribozyme motif. Combination of putatively structural ORF types with differently charged N-termini within a unit suggests that they participate in formation of RNP particles with unusual properties. The associated cis-acting elements are strongly correlated with foreign genes and multigene families in the bdelloid rotifer A. vaga, suggesting their participation in intragenomic and/or intergenomic gene transfer.",
          "It would be of interest to investigate Terminon-encoded ORFs for enzymatic activities in vivo and in vitro, as well as formation of putative RNP complexes, however such studies would be premature until transpositionally active copies are identified. While it is evident that Terminons have been recently transposing, as judged by thehigh degree of nucleotide sequence identitywithin some families (WJ, T) (supplementary fig. S2 and fig. S6C , Supplementary Material online), the sequenced A. vaga strain has been maintained in the laboratory for over 25 years and is no longer experiencing selective pressures to which natural populations are subjected, allowing ORFs to decay. Thus, we expect that further understanding of Terminon biology will come from comparative analysis of multiple bdelloid natural isolates. Although the mode of transmission for most families is predominantly vertical, as their interspecific divergence parallels that of host genes (data not shown), some families could exhibit horizontal mobility.ThegiantsizeandvariableORFcompositionofretroelements described herein pose new challenges to developers of automated TE annotation tools, and leave us wondering how many unknown TE types with the potential to give rise to novel intracellular or extracellular entities are lurking in the still poorly explored genomes of understudied taxonomic groups, and what unanticipated impacts they can have on their eukaryotic hosts.",

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the pathogen of COVID- 19 [1e3] . After SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has become the third coronavirus that causes severe respiratory disease and human death [4, 5] .",
          "Belonging to the subgenus sarbecvirus of Coronaviridae, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are human SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). Its genome is a single-stranded RNA composed of about 30 kb nucleotides. SARS-CoV-2 encodes at least four major structural proteins, namely spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N) [6] . S protein, which is a type I glycoprotein, protrudes from the surface of the virus and can contact the host cell earlier. S protein has attracted great attention because of its function in receptor binding.",
          "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binds to the receptorbinding motif (RBM) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and functions as a receptor for SARS-CoV [7, 8] . ACE2 is widely distributed in heart, liver, testis, kidney, intestine and other tissues. It has the physiological functions of regulating heart and kidney function and controlling blood pressure [9] . Recently, it has been found that human ACE2 promoted the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells [3, 10] . RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human ACE2. Thus, ACE2 is defined as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.",
          "The specificity of the interaction between virus and receptor determines the host tropism and host range. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to be bat [3] . However, the intermediate host is not clear, and some studies suggest that pangolin is involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12] . It is not clear which mammals are involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and which animals may be infected by SARS-CoV-2. By sequence alignment of key amino acids binding to RBD in ACE2, the interaction between RBD of SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV and mammalian ACE2 was predicted. Based on the potential interaction between S protein and mammalian ACE2, it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV preserved the ability to infect many mammals including cat, dog, pangolin and Chinese hamster. From the structure stimulation, we identified N82 in ACE2 show closer contact with F486 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared with M82 of ACE2.",

Based on the known key sites in SARS-CoV S protein interacting with human ACE2, we analyzed whether these sites were conserved on ACE2 from wild mammals and domestic pets. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of ACE2 were conducted using MEGA version X [13] . Phylogenetic tree was generated with Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) evolutionary model using Maximum Likelihood method.",

We compared the RBM in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1A) . These amino acids corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 are L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505 (Fig. 1A) . Although five of six key AAs in SARS-CoV-2 are changed compared with SARS-CoV, the overall structure of interfaces of ACE2-RBM are similar (Fig. 1B) .",

Because the overall structure of interfaces of ACE2-RBM in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar, we analyzed the key RBD recognizing AAs of ACE2 protein from selected mammals, as shown in Table 1 . We predicted that the mammals whose ACE2 could bind to the S protein of SARS- Next, we constructed a phylogenetic tree for mammalian ACE2 proteins. The ACE2 protein sequences of 42 mammalian animals were compared by ClustalW method of MEGA-X software. Then the JTT model of maximum likelihood method was used to construct ACE2 phylogenetic tree. As shown in Fig. 2 , species that cannot bind to S protein are marked in red, and species that can bind to S protein are marked in green. No correlation between genetic distance and the interaction of ACE2/S was found. Some Pets including dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and cat (Felis catus) potentially recognize S protein, indicating the importance to monitor the pets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that four members of Circetidae including Mesocricetus auratus, Phodopus campbelli, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, and Cricetulus griseus remained the key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, though two members of Muridae (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus) could not bind to S protein.

Next, we predicted the structure of cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 with SARSr-CoV RBD. The structure of protein complex between RBD region of S protein of SARS-CoV and human ACE2 has been resolved (PDB: 2AJF) [7] . Recently, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with human ACE2 was also determined [16, 17] . We used Chimera software to display homologous model, and obtained the interaction complex structure of RBD region of SARSr-CoV (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) and cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2. Overall, the RBM structures of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are similar (Fig. 3) . Interaction interface of SARSr-CoV RBD and cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 confirmed the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and cat/dog/pangolin/ Chinese hamster ACE2, indicating that these ACE2 could support SARS-CoV-2 entry. The AA in 82 position of human ACE2 is M82, while the corresponding AA in cat, dog, pangolin and Chinese hamster ACE2 is T82, T81, N82 and N82, respectively. The distance between F486 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the corresponding AA in ACE2 is 3.753Å for human (Fig. 1A) , 2.695Å for dog (Fig. 3A) , 3.753Å for cat (Fig. 3B ), 1.621Å for pangolin (Fig. 3C) , and 2.024Å for Chinese hamster (Fig. 3D) , respectively.

SARS-CoV is believed to come from the Paguma larvata [18] , and the intermediate host of MERS-CoV is Camelus dromedaries [19] . The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has recently caused a serious epidemic in China, but its intermediate hosts are not clear.",
          "S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human ACE2, which promotes the entry of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that human ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [3] . ACE2 contains at least five key amino acids critical for binding S protein of SARSr-CoV [15] . Based on these five amino acids, we analyzed the corresponding amino Table 1 Prediction of the RBD binding capacity of mammalian ACE2.",

          "Phylogenetic tree of mammalian ACE2 proteins. ACE2 sequences from a total of 42 mammals were analyzed by MEGA-X and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with JTT evolutionary model using Maximum Likelihood method. The red represents the species whose ACE2 cannot bind to S protein, and the green is the species whose ACE2 associate with S protein. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)",
          "acids of different mammals to determine which mammalian ACE2 could interact with S protein of human SARSr-CoV. By analyzing the protein sequence of mammalian ACE2, we found that the ACE2 of Camelus dromedarius, Procyon lotor, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus, Loxodonta africana, Erinaceus europaeus, Nyctereutes procyonoides, Suricata suricatta, Dipodomys ordii, and Cavia porcellus lose the capability to associate with S protein (Table 1) . These mammals could be ruled out from the potential host list for SARS-CoV-2. We found that S protein may bind to ACE2 from some wild mammals, which suggests that we should investigate whether these animals may be intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. It has been reported that the RBM region in S protein of pangolin coronavirus is similar to that of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12] , which may be involved in the recombination of SARS-CoV-2. We identified that N82 of pangolin ACE2 showed closer contact with RBD than human ACE2 (Fig. 3C) , indicating that pangolin ACE2 might show better affinity to SARS-CoV-2. This finding further supports the hypothesis that pangolin is involved in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. In current study, only a limited list of wild mammals is covered. In the future, we should select more mammals for study. Although no SARS-CoV-2 has been found in domestic cats and dogs, cat/dog ACE2 may bind to S protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the future, we should pay attention to monitoring whether domestic cats and dogs could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Animal model is an important tool in the study of infectious diseases. ACE2 of mice cannot interact with SARS-CoV-2, so it cannot be used as animal model of SARS-CoV-2 directly. Some studies have generated mice transfected with human ACE2 as the models to study SARS-CoV [20] , and these mice can also be used as animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, we identified that N82 in ACE2 is closer to RBD than M82 (Fig. 3C and D) , indicating a novel strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We speculated that small peptide based on N82 of ACE2 might show higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We proposed that if M82 in human ACE2 was mutated to N82, the modified human ACE2 will enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, those ideas will be tested in cell culture and animal model. We noticed that the ACE2 proteins from Circetidae (Mesocricetus auratus, Phodopus campbelli, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, and Cricetulus griseus) are capable to recognize RBD. Mesocricetus auratus (golden hamster) and Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster) are experimental animals and our finding indicates the possibility to develop small animal models for SARS-CoV-2 infection using Chinese hamster and golden hamster.",

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",
          "Development/adaptation of facility plans should include administrative and critical care stakeholders, review and vetting with other affected department staff [Accident Facilities should establish temporary anteroom/changing area off hallway (2 h).

Using the standard surge capacity worksheet as a tool, determine with incident management which patient care areas to use as infectious patient cohort care depending on the current and anticipated event scope. Cohort areas to may expand and contract during the course of the event 2. Facilities should assist with construction of temporary anterooms for PPE changing adjacent to each cohort area and assure exhaust ventilation for these areas. Supply may not be able to be manipulated for large areas 3. Hospital should implement access control and staff screening/monitoring plans 4. PPE used by staff continuously in infectious/cohort area, potentially hospital-wide depending on scope of the event and transmissibility",
          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

          "The host's angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism may explain epidemiological findings in COVID-19 infections",
          "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemia in 2019/2020 has stimulated research on clinical laboratory findings in this condition, as evidenced by two recent papers in this journal [1, 2] . We know that angiotensin-converting enzyme is involved in corona virus infection. Pathogenic corona viruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), [3, 4] . Not only has ACE2 facilitated the invasion of SARS virus for rapid replication, but also ACE2 is depleted from the cell membrane and therefore the damaging effects of Ang II are enhanced, resulting in acute deterioration of lung tissues [5] . The angiotensin-converting 1 (ACE1) enzyme is characterized by a genetic deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism in intron 16, which is associated with alterations in circulating and tissue concentrations of ACE. The D allele is associated with a reduced expression of ACE2. Although ACE2 and ACE share only 42% of amino acid identity, they both act as carboxypeptidases to cleave amino acids from the peptides' carboxyl terminal [6] .",
          "As this D/I polymorphism shows an important geographical variation [7] , we postulated that the variability in D/I genotype distribution might partly explain the variable prevalence of the COVID-19 infection amongst continental European countries. Therefore, we compared the D-allele frequency of the ACE1 gene as obtained in 25 different European countries with the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19, as calculated on March 20, 2020 by Johns Hopkins [8] . Fig. 1 shows the regression data. Data from Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey were included in the analysis. The log transformed prevalence of COVID-19 infections inversely correlates with the ACE D allele frequency: log (prevalence; number of cases/10 6 inhabitants) = 6.358-0.079 (D-allele frequency, %), r 2 = 0.378; p = 0.001. About 38% of the variability of the prevalence can be explained by the relative frequency of the ACE1 D-allele. Similarly, a significant correlation could be noted between COVID-19 caused mortality (Spearman r = −0.510, p = 0.01) and the prevalence of the ACE1 D-allele. It should also be noted that the two Asian countries which were initially severely hit by the virus, China and Korea, are also characterized by low D allele frequencies.",
          "These data suggest that ACE1 D/I polymorphism may be regarded as a confounder in the spread of COVID-19 and the outcome of the infection in various European populations. These findings are in agreement with the role of ACE in pulmonary infections caused by corona viruses [4] . The ACE D/I genotype may affect the clinical course of the infection."

Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",
          "Development/adaptation of facility plans should include administrative and critical care stakeholders, review and vetting with other affected department staff [Accident Facilities should establish temporary anteroom/changing area off hallway (2 h). Facilities should isolate ventilation to unit and change to 50% supply, 100% exhaust.",
          "Step-down care may be provided in MICU prior to transfer to floor negative pressure rooms 2. Open Surgery and Procedure center as isolation stepdown/critical care isolation area in consultation with incident manager if necessary ([7 patients or more anticipated).

May use operating suites for ICU level care in cooperation with anesthesia. Capacity 36 beds including 24 in waiting/recovery and 12 operating room/procedure rooms 3. PPE used by staff continuously in infectious area Crisis patient care (catastrophic event, e.g., pandemic influenza) 1. Using the standard surge capacity worksheet as a tool, determine with incident management which patient care areas to use as infectious patient cohort care depending on the current and anticipated event scope. Cohort areas to may expand and contract during the course of the event 2. Facilities should assist with construction of temporary anterooms for PPE changing adjacent to each cohort area and assure exhaust ventilation for these areas. Supply may not be able to be manipulated for large areas 3. Hospital should implement access control and staff screening/monitoring plans 4. PPE used by staff continuously in infectious/cohort area, potentially hospital-wide depending on scope of the event and transmissibility",
          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

          "The coronavirus pandemic (SARS-COV2) began in 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1) . At the present moment, there is an exponential increase in both the number of people infected and the number of people dead. On the 31st of March, more than 30,000 people were reported to have died from COVID-19 (1) . In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) (1) announced on the 30th of January, 2020, that COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international interest, and, more recently, on March 11th, 2020, the WHO classified it as a pandemic (1) .",
          "The pandemic process of infectious diseases occurs in three stages: (a) imported cases, (b) local transmission, and (c) sustained community transmission. In an attempt to contain the speed of dissemination of the new virus between and within territories, the WHO (2020) adopted several health measures, based both on the evolution of the disease and the analysis of cases that occurred between countries in Asia and Europe. Such measures have so far ranged from social isolation, surveillance of cases coming from epidemic areas, and increasing public awareness to infection control in health facilities (2) .",
          "Among the health facilities that are very crowded and that can be a space of virus transmission, the gymnasium, and sports facilities stand out. Thus, in an attempt to reduce the scenarios of high virus transmission in Brazil, the Ministry of Health announced, on March 13th, guidelines to avoid the spread of the coronavirus, such as choosing to exercise outdoors instead of taking gymnastics classes in enclosed spaces (3) .",
          "This article has aimed to discuss the need for screening for the practice of physical exercise and to present The Pre-Exercise Screening Questionnaire (PESQ) ( Table 1) for screening and identify people that are in a suitable place to start exercising during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
          "A large and recent epidemiological study carried out in China demonstrated in 1,099 confirmed cases in the laboratory that the clinical manifestations most commonly found in patients with COVID-19 were fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), and headache (13.6%) (4). Concerning fever, a body temperature over 38 • C is being used as a cutoff to direct patients to medical examination, followed by tests for SARS-CoV2 and, if necessary, isolation and adequate treatment (5) . While ",
          "Being physically active is very safe for most people. Some people, however, should consult their doctors before starting physical exercise, especially if they experience symptoms of fever for many days.",
          "Answer Yes or No to the Following Questions 1) Do you feel a sore throat? 2) Do you feel cough and sputum production? 3) Do you feel fatigue? 4) Do you feel short of breath or difficulty breathing? 5) Do you feel fever >37.8 • C? 6) Have you had fever for more than three days >37.8 • C? 7) Have you had any contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or suspected of the new coronavirus?",
          "If you answered yes to question number seven (Q-6) and/or number nine (Q-7), You should ask for a medical clearance along with information about specific for starting exercise.",
          "If you answered no to all the PESQ questions, you can be reasonably sure that you can exercise safely and have a low risk of having any medical complications from exercise.",
          "fever and cough are the most present symptoms, other less prevalent respiratory (shortness of breath and sputum production) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea) symptoms can be observed (6-9), suggesting differences in the viral tropism of COVID-19 compared to influenza. At this moment, fever, excessive nasal mucosa discharge (rhinorrhea), and muscle pain are predominant characteristics in COVID-19 (4, 10). Thus, evaluating these signs and symptoms before the practice of physical activity should be considered. It is important to note that the infected do not present any symptoms during the incubation period, and the incubation period can last for 5.5 days on average (11). However, the symptoms appear on average of 11.5 after the infection (11). Thus, these symptoms should be questioned daily. For this reason, as determined by the ACSM (2020), those who do not present signs and symptoms of the disease should be able continue to exercise regularly. COVID-19 spreads rapidly from human to human (12) . Some studies have demonstrated that each person infected transmits, on average, to four other persons (13) . For this reason, social distancing and isolation are required. Facing this new scenario of social isolation, exercise professionals have been using online technology to prescribe, and monitor exercise (14) , such as mobile telephones messages, apps, email, video calls, or other internet-based strategies (15) .",
          "Scientific societies, such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ASCM) and the Brazilian Society of Exercise and Sports Medicine (BSESM), have released reports and guides to assist exercise professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis (16) . In these documents, societies have highlighted the positive impact of the regular practice of physical exercise on the improvement of the immunological system in humans, highlighting that physically active people have a lower risk of developing chronic-degenerative diseases, which is pertinent, as a those with affected by this are at higher risk if infected by SARS-COV2 (17) . The BSESM and the ACSM defend the practice of regular physical activity as an adjuvant factor in combating morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus.",
          "Additionally, the BSESM have also created a report that indicates that, in the presence of signs compatible with respiratory infections, such as fever, cough, and dyspnea (shortness of breath), the practice of exercise should be suspended. A brief communication from (18) the American College of Sports Medicine suggests that, for those do not exhibit signs of symptoms, the specific recommendations for their age and group should be followed without restrictions or limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, people in isolation and with a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, but who are asymptomatic, should be able to continue the regular practice of physical activity following a moderate intensity. However, in the presence of symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, and dyspnea), the practice of physical activity should be interrupted and medical assistance sought (18) . Therefore, it is important to the exercise professional to be aware of how to evaluate and screen for these symptoms to suggest who can exercise safely.",
          "A more rigid screening was adopted by the Federal Council of Dentistry (CFO), which still uses the feverish state (>37.3 • C) of the last 14 days to assess the possibility or not of care (14) . Temperature evaluation seems to be a pertinent pre-participation evaluation. Although non-specific symptom, it is one of the main symptoms of COVID-19, and, during the pandemic, it presents as a method with good sensitivity and ability to identify potentially contaminated people. As an example, a study of 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, documented that fever was present in 98.6% (136/138) of hospitalized patients. The other two patients who did not have fever were in intensive care unit beds, which may make us think of two situations: (a) they could have been medicated, which masks the result, and (b) the feverish state is not an indicator of the severity of the disease (19) . However, restrictions based only on body temperature may not be sufficient and must be associated with other findings. Assessing the presence of preexisting comorbidity is also extremely important.",
          "It is also essential to question a retrospective view of the events that preceded the last days of the beginning of the practice of physical activity. For this reason, it is important to observe the presence of risk of exposure behaviors, such as trips abroad and/or contact with people suspected virus. This also applies to places where no community transmission has been declared. Considering that telepresential training has no limitations. However, these criteria should be associated with the declared health situation of the client/patient's place of residence. If the place of residence is related to community contagion, this will not make sense.",
          "Finally, particularities, such as the level of functional capacity, must be followed according to the ACSM recommendations (20) , particularly for elderly people (21) . The need to perform physical activity is as evident as the need to guarantee the necessary security of its practitioners. Criteria to functional independence proposed by Katz et al. (22) , for the advanced activities of daily life, should be questioned before release for proposed exercises. If a population group has a poor health status, it tends to worsen dramatically after the involvement of COVID-19. Thus, questioning their independence for advanced activities of daily life may provide some safety data to ensure a greater degree of autonomy to practice without the direct supervision of a professional.",
          "Given the aforementioned challenges during this pandemic crisis, it is critical for people to exercise. For the purpose of doing it safely, the screening of COVID-19-related symptoms prior to exercise may help to identify those that are able to start exercising. Therefore, we have developed a tool to screen for the main COVID-19 symptoms to ensure the safety of exercise prescription. The Pre-Exercise Screening Questionnaire (PESQ) aims to quickly detect symptoms of COVID-19 to assess a person's readiness for physical exercise. This is prudent to avoid the potential risk of exacerbation of respiratory symptoms when starting exercise. The PESQ has seven questions that should be answered with a yes or no. Item 1 measures sore throat. Item 2 measures cough and sputum production. Item 3 measures fatigue. Item 4 measures shortness of breath or difficulty of breathing. Item 5 and 6 are related to fever, and Item 7 is related to any contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or suspected of the new coronavirus.",
          "The instrument has some advantages since it is easy, simple, and quick to apply on a large scale without additional costs. This is particularly important due to the negative change in the global economic situation and the rapid growth of this disease. Also, the questionnaire is important not only for the identification of individuals with a greater need for clinical examinations but also for the identification of those who do not need immediate tests.",
          "It is worth mentioning some limitations of the present study. For example, the PESQ will not identify asymptomatic people. Another disadvantage is that it is reliant on the interpretation of the individual's signs and symptoms without making available a professional assessment. Finally, the PESQ does not eliminate the need for medical clearance and/or exercise testing in many individuals; this is a simple screen tool for screening for relevant COVID-19 symptoms.",

          "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a complex disease characterized by inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and sinonasal mucosa. 1 Persistent sinonasal symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks and objective findings of sinonasal inflammation via nasal endoscopy 2 or computed tomography 3 of paranasal sinuses are recommended for the diagnosis of CRS for clinical and research purposes as diagnosis based only on symptoms may not be accurate. 4, 5 The pathogenesis of CRS is multifactorial with infectious, genetic, and environmental factors all playing a role in the disease process. Yet, the exact contribution of each of these factors is unclear. Infections associated with CRS are typically viral or bacterial, but in some cases may be fungal. CRS exacerbations triggered by these infectious pathogens will be referred to as infectious CRS in this review, but this term is not well defined in the literature. The role of bacterial infections in CRS is unknown and viral infections in CRS are not well studied, but viruses may be associated with acute rhinosinusitis. This review will elaborate on infectious CRS, specifically focusing on bacterial infections, underlying reasons for the infections and the associated comorbidities. All other forms of CRS will be discussed elsewhere in this journal.",
          "CRS affects up to 31 million people (12.5% of the population) in the United States alone. CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) account for approximately 60%-65% and 33% of all CRS cases, respectively. 1 This chronic disease results in reduced quality of life by causing poor sleep, fatigue, and bodily pain. 6 CRS is associated with significant health care costs and based on a systematic review can lead to an annual expenditure of 2014 US dollar equivalent of $9.9 billion in direct costs and $13.1 billion in indirect costs. [6] [7] [8] A survey-based study identified that over a 5-year period, close to 48 million outpatient visits in the United States were for CRS and antibiotics were prescribed 69% of the time. 9 We suspect that a great majority of these clinic visits were because of infectious CRS exacerbations, suggesting significant utilization of health care resources. Difficult-to-treat CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) may be associated with humoral immunodeficiency 5 as discussed later. A small percentage of patients with refractory sinusitis have genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) that increase the risk to develop this disease. 10 ",
          "Patients with CRSsNP generally present with symptoms of facial pain and purulent drainage, whereas those with CRSwNP may have similar symptoms but predominantly complain of nasal obstruction with or without hyposmia or anosmia. 11 Patients with CRS have some degree of persistent sinonasal symptoms, whereas patients with RARS are symptom free between episodes of acute exacerbations. Patients who complain of constant nasal congestion and have thick \"peanut butter-like\" secretions in their nasal or sinus cavities should be evaluated for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. 5 Abbreviations used CF-Cystic fibrosis CFTR-Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CRS-Chronic rhinosinusitis CRSsNP-Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps CRSwNP-Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps CVID-Common variable immunodeficiency NTHI-Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae PCD-Primary ciliary dyskinesia RARS-Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis SAD-Specific antibody deficiency SNP-Single nucleotide polymorphism STAT3-Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 URTI-Upper respiratory tract infection",
          "Allergic rhinitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, immunodeficiencies, CF, PCD, and autoimmune diseases such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are associated with CRS, but their causality in the development of CRS has not been proven. 1, 5, 11, 12 Some of these comorbid and coexisting medical conditions can either predispose patients with CRS to develop infectious exacerbations or are a consequential outcome of this chronic sinonasal condition. Asthma and CRS often coexist; asthma exacerbations are associated with CRS exacerbations and treatment of CRS results in improved asthma control. 13, 14 A large percentage of patients with bronchiectasis have CRS, and the presence of CRS is associated with more severe bronchiectasis. 15 Disorders of the mucociliary transport system may contribute to the development of CRS as well. CF is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, 16 and specific mutations in DNAH5 and DNAH11 are found in patients with PCD. CF and PCD are discussed further in other sections of this journal issue.",
          "The exact pathogenesis of CRS remains unknown. 17 Pathophysiology of CRS is complex and is based on the fundamental principle of dysfunctional interaction between the host and environmental factors at the interface of the sinonasal mucosa. As a result, multiple different mechanisms have been proposed. 18 Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is implicated in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. 18 Both local and systemic IgE to S. aureus enterotoxins have been demonstrated in patients with CRSwNP, and the levels of specific IgE directly correlated with type 2 eosinophilic inflammation characteristic of CRSwNP. 19, 20 This concept will be further discussed in other parts of this journal series.",
          "The role of bacteria in CRS is unclear. The sinus cavity is not a sterile zone and is colonized by various species of bacteria. Polymicrobial bacterial species have been identified in healthy and diseased sinus mucosa by conventional culture and molecular techniques. [21] [22] [23] It is proposed that colonizing bacteria can contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS via formation of biofilms. Biofilms are composed of layers of live bacteria within a matrix of protein and nucleic acid. These bacterial plaques on mucosal surfaces allow infectious pathogens to develop antimicrobial resistance and evade host defenses 24 because these bacteria are metabolically inactive, potentially leading to infectious CRS exacerbations. Studies suggest that bacterial biofilms are a cause of recalcitrant CRS. 25 Alteration in the sinonasal microbiome may also contribute to the pathogenesis of CRS. Patients with CRS have microbiome dysbiosis, 26 which is characterized by reduced bacterial diversity and an increase in relative abundance of specific bacterial species compared with healthy individuals. 27 This altered microbial flora contributes to the phenotypic differences between patients with CRS and those without CRS.",
          "An \"immune barrier hypothesis\" as a cause of CRS has also been proposed. 18 Epithelial cells secrete host defense molecules, which include small peptides and enzymes. Small peptides such as defensins and cathelicidins and large enzymatic proteins such as lysozyme and lactoferrin kill bacteria. 28 Abnormalities in the epithelial cell barrier function result in an impaired immune system and allow colonization by infectious pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. The S100 family of proteins produced by epithelial cells plays an important role in cell differentiation, barrier function, and antimicrobial activity. Studies in patients with CRS have shown reduced levels of S100 proteins, psoriasin, and calprotectin, which may potentially increase susceptibility to infections. 28, 29 Another family of epithelium-secreted proteins called PLUNC (palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone), which is involved in innate immunity, was profoundly reduced in polyp tissue of patients with CRSwNP. 30, 31 Additional abnormalities in the innate immune system that may contribute to infectious CRS include reduced expression of SPINK5, a gene responsible for expression of epithelial protein, LEKT1, which is decreased in CRS but is important for epithelial barrier function. 32 Epithelial cell host defense molecule release is regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), 12 and blunting of STAT3 signaling has been demonstrated in CRS and may be responsible for decreased antimicrobial protein release from epithelial cells in nasal polyps. 33 A noteworthy innate immunity receptor that may play a role in CRS pathogenesis is the bitter taste receptor, T2R38, which is activated by bacterial products. 34 T2R38 stimulates epithelial cells to produce nitrous oxide and helps kill bacteria and assists in mucociliary clearance of pathogens and prevention of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). 35 T2R38 gene polymorphism (TAS2R38 genotype) makes the bitter taste receptor inactive and predisposes patients to gram-negative URTIs and is a risk factor for the development of CRS. 34 All these defects in the epithelial cell barrier function create an impaired innate immune system and may make the sinonasal mucosa vulnerable to pathogens and microbial colonization. Overall, there is no single cause but multiple factors that make a host susceptible to CRS.",
          "Although patients with CRS have ongoing sinonasal symptoms, some of them may develop episodic worsening of symptoms that may be characterized by purulent nasal discharge. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species can be obtained from diseased and nondiseased sinus mucosa of those suffering with CRS. 36 Overall, S. aureus is the most common organism isolated in patients with CRS. 21 Based on molecular diagnostics, S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes are the abundant organisms in patients with CRS. 21, 22 In general, fewer bacterial pathogens are identified from the sinus mucosa via conventional culture compared with molecular-based techniques. 21 Aside from S. aureus, pathogens that are cultured from patients with CRS include coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 22, 23 Additionally, patients with CRS with purulent secretions have increased abundance of Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella species as identified via quantitative DNA PCR. 22 In contrast with usual community-acquired rhinosinusitis exacerbations, nosocomial rhinosinusitis exacerbations are predominantly caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 37, 38 Commonly isolated organisms from patients with CRS are summarized in Table I . Microorganisms that are not detected either via conventional culture or with molecular diagnostics are likely part of the resident microbiome and probably help maintain a healthy sinus mucosa. Additionally, it may be that some nonpathogenic bacteria within the sinus mucosa are indeed responsible in the CRS disease process, but their exact role is unclear. Viral URTIs can contribute to CRS exacerbations too. In one study, coronavirus was identified via molecular sequencing as the most common virus in patients with CRS. 39 Although the exact role of viruses in CRS exacerbation is not certain, they likely contribute to the disturbance of the symbiotic microbiome and lead to clinical disease.",
          "Patients with difficult-to-treat CRS should be evaluated for an underlying immunodeficiency. 5 Antibody deficiencies are the most common primary immunodeficiency associated with CRS. A recent meta-analysis of antibody deficiency in patients with CRS reported a combined prevalence of IgG, IgA, and IgM deficiencies in 13% of patients with recurrent CRS and 23% of patients with difficult-to-treat CRS. 40 Antibody deficiencies can occur because of defect in antibody production (common variable immunodeficiency, IgA or IgM deficiency) or because of poor antibody function (specific antibody deficiency). Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic antibody deficiency and is characterized by the reduction in IgG levels by more than 2 standard deviations in association with low IgA and/or IgM levels. In addition, there is impaired response to polysaccharide and protein antigens in CVID. More than 50% of patients with CVID have CRS. 41 The prevalence of selective IgA deficiency (IgA level <7 mg/dL) 42 is estimated at 1 in 300 to700 people. 43 Most IgA deficient patients are asymptomatic; however, approximately 7% of patients with CRS may have IgA deficiency. 40 Specific antibody deficiency (SAD) is defined as an impaired response to immunization with polysaccharide antigens such as Pneumovax in the setting of normal quantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and a history of recurrent or prolonged sinopulmonary infections. 1, 44 An adequate response to a polysaccharide vaccine is not well defined; however, 50%-70% of pneumococcal serotypes should be above 1.3 mcg/mL after vaccination. 43 In a retrospective review of patients with difficult-to-treat CRS, up to 23% of the patients were noted to have SAD. 44 Humoral immunodeficiencies that are typically associated with infectious CRS are summarized in Table II . Patients with CRS and immune dysfunction may require a more aggressive treatment strategy, which includes prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrent infectious CRS exacerbations, early culture-based antibiotic therapy, immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy, 1 or early surgical management. 45 ",
          "Odontogenic rhinosinusitis should be suspected in patients with dental pain and in those patients who have had a recent dental or oral surgical procedure. Dental infections can cause odontogenic rhinosinusitis, specifically involving the maxillary sinuses, and are typically unilateral. 5, 46 Up to 10% to 12% of maxillary sinusitis cases are believed to be due to odontogenic infections. Odontogenic rhinosinusitis occurs when the schneiderian membrane, the membrane lining the maxillary sinus mucosa, is breached because of a dental infection or after a dental procedure. 46 Bacterial organisms that are commonly found in the oral flora typically cause odontogenic rhinosinusitis and include both aerobic and anaerobic species. Treatment of odontogenic rhinosinusitis is important because untreated infections can extend to the orbital and cranial structures and cause serious complications. Furthermore, the underlying odontogenic infection should be addressed either via endodontic therapy (root canal) or removal of the infected source to prevent recurrence of odontogenic rhinosinusits. 46 TREATMENT Treatment options for CRS include topical intranasal steroid, oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, nasal saline irrigation, oral steroids, or combination of oral antibiotics and steroids. 5 Difficult-to-treat CRS may require surgery and CRS in the setting of an underlying immunodeficiency may necessitate prophylactic antibiotics or Ig replacement therapy. Topical intranasal steroids help decrease sinonasal inflammation and can be extremely effective in managing some patients with CRS. 5 Nasal saline irrigation removes mucus and assists in clearing bacterial biofilms. 4 The combination of both topical intranasal steroid and nasal saline irrigation may be helpful in CRS, but among these 2 treatment options, topical intranasal steroid is superior as single therapy alone. 47 Although treatment with oral antibiotics is usually the first therapeutic option utilized in CRS, strong evidence for using oral antibiotics in CRS is lacking in the literature. There are only 3 placebocontrolled studies evaluating treatment with oral antibiotics in CRS. [48] [49] [50] A Cochrane review on systemic antibiotics for CRS, which included only 1 randomized study, showed limited effectiveness of macrolide therapy. 51 Since then, one study showed that long-term use of azithromycin for the treatment of CRS did not show benefit compared with placebo. 49 Another study evaluating the use of oral antibiotics was in patients with CRSwNP and will be discussed in other sections of this journal. 50 Oral antibiotics may be most useful in infectious CRS exacerbations and especially in those patients with purulent drainage. Topical antibiotics may be effective in CRS, but they are more likely to benefit postesinus surgery patients or those patients who receive culture-directed antibiotics. 52 Finally, oral steroids can provide symptomatic relief from nasal congestion and improve sense of smell in patients with CRSwNP. 5 Retrospective studies looking at oral antibiotics and steroids together in patients with CRS have demonstrated improvement in symptoms, decrease in radiographic severity of sinus disease, 53 and decreased likelihood of sinus surgery. 54 Although there are some available therapies for CRS, better, reliable, and more targeted treatment options are necessary.",
          "The high prevalence of CRS in inherited syndromes such as CF, PCD, ataxia telangiectasia, and Young's syndrome suggests that genetics likely plays a role in the development of CRS. 55 Genetic association studies have helped identify numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in innate (ie, toll-like receptor pathway) 17 and adaptive immunity, arachidonic acid metabolism, and sinonasal tissue remodeling. 16 However, many of these genetic study findings have been limited by lack of reproducibility of results and conflicting data. 16 Large-scale genome-wide association studies that can replicate discovered genetic data are needed to validate the association of gene-specific SNPs identified in patients with CRS. To date, the association of CRS and CFTR gene mutations is the most promising finding due to replication of data in various studies. 16 The high prevalence of CRS in patients with CF suggests that the CFTR gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of CRS.",
          "Biomarkers for the diagnosis of infectious CRS exacerbations are currently lacking. There is no biomarker that is consistently used to identify an acute CRS exacerbation. Although direct sinus cavity culture results are used in clinical practice for management of CRS, these are not always reliable due to the high rate of bacterial colonization of the sinus mucosa. In a study of chinchillas infected with nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHI) strains, 2 NTHI proteins were discovered in sinonasal secretions and show promise as potential biomarkers for active disease. 56 Large-scale human studies are required for validation of these types of biomarkers.",
          "An approach should be established to identify patients with infectious CRS. Patients with recurrent infectious CRS exacerbations or difficult-to-treat CRS, who fail empiric treatment with combination of topical or oral antibiotics with or without steroids, should undergo nasal endoscopy and get culture-directed antibiotic therapy if indicated. This is the best diagnostic approach that is available currently, but it is important to note that culture-based diagnosis may not be as accurate as molecular diagnostics. Concomitant immunodeficiency should also be suspected in this subset of patients, and laboratory workup including complete blood count with differential, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), specific antibody response to polysaccharide antigens (IgG antibody response 4 weeks postvaccination after pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), complement function, and if necessary, measurement of Band T-cell numbers by flow cytometry should be performed. 5 Patients with high-risk sexual behavior should undergo HIV screening to exclude an acquired immunodeficiency. 5 Prophylactic antibiotics or Ig replacement therapy should be considered in patients with recurrent exacerbations of infectious CRS and proven defect in humoral immunity. 5 Any patient with CRS with concern for immunodeficiency or with the presence of atypical or opportunistic pathogens in the sinonasal mucosa should be referred for evaluation to a clinic specializing in allergy, sinus disease, and immunodeficiency. If anatomic abnormalities such as deviated nasal septum are believed to be the cause of recurrent infectious CRS exacerbations, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for surgical evaluation. 5 Additionally, any patient diagnosed with nasal polyps or CRS at an early age and with P. aeruginosa cultured from the sinonasal cavity should be evaluated for CF. 5 ",
          "More focused research is needed in identifying defects in innate immunity and mucociliary clearance, impact of sinonasal microbiome, allergy, and genetics to develop new preventative and therapeutic options for the management of CRS. For example:",
          "Antibiofilm-directed interventions could help minimize CRS exacerbations by targeting the colonizing microbiome. 5 Specific genotyping directed toward bitter taste receptor (T2R38) may help identify a specific endotype of CRS. 34 More efforts are needed to identify the true impact of oral antibiotics and the optimal duration of antibiotic use in infectious CRS.",
          "Although biomarkers for CRS are being developed, larger scale studies need to be conducted in humans to confirm the validity of these diagnostic tests before they can be marketed for clinical use. Overall, given the complexity of CRS, microbiome fingerprinting may be the next step in developing the precise diagnostic approach for this disease.",
          "Infectious CRS is a subtype under the umbrella of CRS. Infectious CRS exacerbations can be triggered by viruses that cause URTIs or because of an imbalance among the bacterial species making up the sinonasal microbiome. There have been significant discoveries in understanding the complex pathogenesis of CRS, with an ongoing focus on the microbiota within the sinus cavities. Nevertheless, unique biomarkers to identify an infectious CRS exacerbation and evidence-based treatment options for CRS are still lacking and are gaps that need to be investigated further."

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",

          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

          "Overlay networks are recognized as a way of improving Internet services in many fields, most of which only related to onedimensional data (Hu et al., 2008; Tanin et al., 2007; Jelasity et al., 2009) . With the increase in demand for online services of spatial information, the challenges of fast indexing in distributed networks has become a hot research topic in the combined field of Computer Science and Geographic Information Science. The indexing information involves multi-dimensional data, the corresponding online services of which are becoming increasingly more complicated, especially in that they require complex spatial extent data (e.g. BBox, Bounding Box) with a massive number of concurrent users through network browser. For example, there exist a massive number of concurrent queries for spatial extent data about the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in the spring of 2003. The GIS (Geographic Information Systems) based on browser/server (Gogu et al., 2006) cannot efficiently support these large-scale spatial information queries and indexing since the central GIS server unavoidably suffers with hotspot bottleneck and single point of failure (Wu et al., 2010) . Here term large-scale means the number of concurrent users is very large, maybe up to thousands or even millions. There exists a contradiction between hotspot bottleneck of GIS server and a massive number of concurrent users for spatial information queries. This scientific problem has not yet been solved completely. Therefore, various new methods have been investigated to address this problem.",
          "Distributed computing technologies such as Grid computing, Cloud computing and overlay networks are mainly used to support large-scale spatial information indexing. In Grid computing, there is often a central management for resource management and work load allocation. Therefore, compared with Grid computing, overlay networks have the advantages of dynamicity and scalable selfconfiguration (Foster and Iamnitchi, 2003) . Cloud computing is another computing model that distributes computing tasks in a resource pool based on a central computer cluster (Mateescu et al., 2011) . Contrary to Cloud computing, overlay networks can make full use of idle computing resources of many endpoints (Tanin et al., 2007; Jelasity et al., 2005 Jelasity et al., , 2009 Kantere et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) .",
          "Regarding spatial data network processing, Tanin et al. (2006 Tanin et al. ( , 2007 presented their preliminary work, DQTChord, which is the work most closely related to our study. In this paper, we compare our approach with DQTChord, in which the spatial data is first divided based on Distributed Quad-Tree, and then mapped onto a Chord. Our approach differs from theirs in that we use a hybrid structure for the overlay network, which includes two layers and considers semantic information. Peers with similar semantics in our semantic overlay network are organized into same peer clusters, which make sharing information among peers more efficiently. The benefits of our approach include a decreased indexing load and increased indexing efficiency. Other related works include (Hu et al., 2008) , which uses the P2P framework FLoD to 3D scene streaming for virtual globe applications, and Kantere et al., 2009 , which use SPATIALP2P, a totally decentralized framework for spatial data built on top of a one-dimensional DHT. In (Zhang et al., 2009) a swift tree structure for multidimensional data indexing is proposed, which has a query efficiency of O(logN) in terms of routing hops and an low maintenance cost. Our spatial information indexing is substantially different. It is based on a semantic overlay network with a multi-layer structure.",
          "As for semantic overlays (Resnik, 1999; Doulkeridis et al., 2007; Tirado et al., 2010) , Resnik (1999) presented a measure based on the notion of information contexts. An algorithm for the distributed and decentralized construction of hierarchical SONs in unstructured P2P networks is presented by Doulkeridis et al. (2007) , which is a distributed method of clustering content in a recursive way. Tirado et al. (2010) proposed an affinity AP2P, which is similar to our approach. It uses a novel affinity-based metric to estimate the distance between clusters of nodes sharing similar content. However, there are two main differences from AP2P. First, we define the different semantic similarity function for spatial information. Second, we introduce the epidemic protocol for overlay construction.",
          "There is a large amount of general purpose literature on epidemic protocols and small world networks. Some authors present general protocols based on gossip and the theoretic foundation of epidemics while our work focuses on spatial information indexing (Jelasity et al., 2005 (Jelasity et al., , 2009 Demers et al., 1987; Fabrikant et al., 2002; Renesse et al., 2008) . Other authors introduce the theory and methods for small world networks, which is the theoretical foundation for our research work (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Li et al., 2008) .",
          "In this paper, we introduce a spatial data indexing mechanism, which is based on a semantic overlay network. This network is connected by logical links between peers in a semantic quad-tree topology, which is a small world network with a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient. In our semantic quad-tree, peers with similar semantics are organized into same peer clusters, which can be further adaptively arranged into a small world network. According to this semantic proximity, we can dynamically construct the topology of an overlay network in a robust, dependable manner based on our previous work, i.e., HPSIN and SDI-CDQT (Wu et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) . In (Wu et al., 2010) a HPSIN was proposed by us, which combines distributed quad-tree with distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain both query efficiency and system load balance. Based on our HPSIN, we further propose a SDI-CDQT extending the quad-tree layer in HPSIN by semantic clustering strategy (Zou et al., 2011) , which makes the peers with similar interesting belong to the same cluster. However, there exist insufficiencies under a massive number of concurrent users indexing since both HPSIN and SDI-CDQT did not effectively consider the construction of overlay network for large-scale spatial information indexing. To our best knowledge, there lacks effective fast construction protocol of overlay network and the corresponding theoretical analysis for spatial information indexing.",
          "The main contributions of this paper are thereby four-fold 1) An effective semantic clustering strategy based on a uniform semantic metric is adopted that make peers with similar interests organized in same clusters. 2) A new semantic overlay network and the corresponding construction protocol based on gossip for large-scale spatial information indexing (SON_LSII) are proposed. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the convergence speed of SON_LSII is formally presented from four cases. The SON_LSII supports a massive number of concurrent users indexing and is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive tradeoff between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. 3) We propose efficient algorithms to support large-scale range queries of the spatial information in a parallel manner based on SON_LSII framework. 4) Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of SON_LSII with regard to various aspects, including scalability, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, adaptability, and so on.",
          "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of our system. In Section 3, we discuss our theoretical model of a semantic overlay network and an analysis thereof. Section 4 details the large-scale spatial information indexing algorithm based on a semantic overlay network. In Section 5 we give the theoretical and experimental results that characterize key properties of this overlay network and a performance analysis of our algorithm. Section 6 presents our conclusions and future work.",
          "Before describing SON_LSII model in detail, we present an overview of our system. While there exist some different points from HPSIN as described in Section 1.3, the system structure of SON_LSII is similar to HPSIN (Wu et al., 2010) , which is a hybrid structure including Chord Ring Layer and Semantic Quad-tree Layer as depicted in Fig. 1 . Differing from the DQTChord (Distributed Quad-Tree Chord) structure (Tanin et al., 2007) , our hybrid structure stores subspace data directly in a semantic quad-tree rather than a Chord ring to reduce the communication cost and enhance indexing efficiency. Fig. 1 depicts the hybrid structure of SON_LSII, which is organized in layered clustering method. First, we place the head peer of the semantic cluster into the Chord ring layer according to the semantics of spatial information that peer holds. And then, in semantic quad-tree, we let each head peer maintain a cluster of four neighboring peers based on a uniform k-element Semantic Vector (SV) where k is some constant. The two main aspects of the semantic space correspond to two sub-SVs, SV 1 and SV 2 . SV¼{SV 1 , SV 2 }¼ e 11 ; e 12 ; …; e 1k 1 È É ; e 21 ; e 22 ; …; e 2k 2 È É È É , k 1 +k 2 ¼ k. Note that Semantic Vector corresponds to a point in the semantic space while the word \"semantic\" here means that the element in SV and the point in the semantic space both contain some concrete feature or attribute, which is represented by one element e ij in the SV with the data object including a weight ij . SV 1 and SV 2 correspond to two aspects, respectively, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances, such as online time and bandwidth. For an example, if there are three peers A,B,C, peer A requests some spatial information that hold by peer B and C, and peer B and C have the same online time, peer A perhaps share data with peer B or peer C. However, if peer B have shorter online time than peer C, peer A would only create one P2P logical link with peer C and share data with peer C. One peer in a semantic overlay network can be regarded as a point in the k-dimensional semantic space. Furthermore, the proximity of two peers can be represented by the Euclidean distance between the two points in the semantic space.",
          "We first present the semantic clustering strategy based on SV, and then we describe the construction of SON_LSII. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence speed of SON_LSII model.",
          "As described above, SV¼{SV 1 , SV 2 }, semantics in SV 1 includes the semantics of spatial information held by the peers, such as the extent, resolution, and layer of spatial data, and the meaning of SV 2 lies in the peers' network performance, such as online time and bandwidth, which are gotten from the metadata in its caches' history information. As for the values and corresponding weights of elements in the SV 1 , especially for the element in-spatial extent data, we firstly need one method to map these multidimensional data into one-dimensional data. Therefore, we propose a novel mapping method, called Adaptive Spatial Information Linearization (ASIL).",
          "A spatial object typically has an extent with multi-dimensional features and cannot easily be linearized into a one-dimensional data value. The Hilbert curve or Z-curve can be used to map a regularly coordinated multi-dimensional spatial data space into a lowdimensional space (Li et al., 2008) . However, in our case, the SV includes both SV 1 and SV 2 . We introduce the ASIL method to map the spatial data space into one control point (CP) uniquely (Tanin et al., 2007) , and then let this point be an element in the SV 1 . Furthermore, combined with SV 2 , we can get the point in the uniform semantic space corresponding to SV for each peer.",
          "The method for mapping the spatial data space into one element in the SV 1 uses the minimal boxes bounding the spatial object, i.e. BBox. Considering the Semantic Vector consists of many elements while spatial extent only is one kind of elements, therefore, we use a BBox to map spatial extent to one-dimensional control point. For any spatial extent, we can get one unique control point from the center of its BBox. Whether a spatial object is a polygon or a polyline, there exists a minimal BBox for this spatial object. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of two spatial objects and the corresponding BBox and CP. The spatial object in BBox A comprises one CP O 1 at level 1 and four recursive space subdivisions A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , respectively. The spatial object in BBox B is divided two levels: the CP O 1 corresponds to level 1 and the CPs O 11 , O 12 , O 13 and O 14 correspond to level 2.",
          "According to the semantic proximity value, a peer can decide which cluster to join. In order to compute the semantic proximity and find its location in our k-dimensional semantic space, all values and weights in the SV need to be obtained. Some values and weights of elements can be derived from the metadata, including the resolution and layer. The other values and weights of key elements in the SV, such as the extent of spatial data, are not easily obtained, and thus we propose a method to compute these. From the ASIL given above, we know that the spatial data's extent can be uniquely represented by its CP. We define Eq. (1) to compute the semantic proximity value between two CPs, CPx and CPy, and Eq. (2) to compute the value of its corresponding weight.",
          "Following the theory in Sheldom (2009), Zou et al. (2011) , the more information two CPs share, the more similar they are. Equation (1) expresses the semantics of one layer in the whole division, where Set(CPx,CPy) is the common super class set of CPx and CPy, T is one element of control point, P(T) is the probability of T emerging in all level, CPNum is the emerging number of control point NSCP, N is the total number of all control points. Equation (2) expresses statistical weight for each similarity including the semantics in various layers, where N i is the number of CPs in the ith layer, and ∑ j o Fmax j ¼ Fmin N j is the total number of CPs between the F max and F min layers. F max and F min express the maximum and minimum number of subdivision levels, respectively.",
          "So far, the values and corresponding weights of k-dimensional elements in the SV can be obtained, which is a uniform semantic metric. According to Eq. (3), where k 1 , k 2 , weight ij and e ij are defined in Section 2, when a new peer with similar semantics wishes to join SON_LSII, it first determines the most suitable cluster and then selects the semantic position with the maximum semantic metric in this cluster.",
          "In contrast to the random joining strategy adopted in other overlay networks, this semantic clustering strategy takes advantage of the homogeneity between peers and reduces the indexing cost.",
          "Based on the semantic clustering strategy, we give a fast construction protocol, by which peers with similar semantics are organized in the same peer cluster and further adaptively arranged into a small world semantic network -SON_LSII.",
          "There are two kinds of key protocols in building SON_LSII: a key-based routing protocol in the Chord ring layer and a gossipbased protocol in the semantic quad-tree layer. Using a key-based routing protocol, the centroid position in semantic subspace SV 1 can be hashed to address locations in the Chord ring. This routing protocol exhibits promising load-balancing behavior while without taking advantage of the homogeneity between data objects. Therefore, we introduce a clustering strategy based on the gossip protocol in the semantic quad-tree layer allowing SON_LSII to adapt dynamically to the locality of the data distribution and retain good load-balancing behavior at the same time, especially under a massive number of concurrent users.",
          "Herein we focus on the gossip-based protocol, which is extended according to the newscast model of computation (Jelasity et al., 2005 (Jelasity et al., , 2009 ) using the value of the metric in Eq. (3) as the clustering strategy. In this protocol, all peers periodically exchange their descriptors with other peers, thereby constantly improving their local partial views. Let α denote the local partial views, where α(i) denotes the local partial views of peer i, α(i)¼α(i)⊕α(j) denotes the merger operation of the local partial views of peers i and j, and rank(α(i),j) denotes the operation of sorting the local partial views of peer i according to the interesting metric of peer j.",
          "The basic idea of the protocol is as follows:",
          "(1) initialize the α(i) of each peer i, i¼{1,2,…N};",
          "(2) periodically wait δ time units;",
          "(3) peer i selects its child peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 } from the α(i);",
          "(4) update α(i) by α(i)¼ α(i)⊕α(j),j¼{p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 };",
          "(5) send the updated view α(i) to the peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 }; (6) receive the views from peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 } and rank(α(i),j),j¼ {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 }; (7) repeat from step 2 until the perfect target SON_LSII is obtained.",
          "There are several critical steps that need to be addressed in the protocol for SON_LSII: (i) steps 5 and 6 must be executed as separate threads, thereby supporting massive concurrency of peers. (ii) The perfect target SON_LSII in step 7 means that each peer that differs from the root in the F min layer of SON_LSII must know its parent, while non-leaf peers must know their four children.",
          "Differing from the empirical method in (Jelasity et al., 2009) , we introduce stochastic processes to describe the relationship between convergence speed and network size of SON_LSII model under different cases (Sheldom, 1983) .",
          "Let F min ¼2 and F max ¼ 5 in Fig. 2, i.e., there are 4 Fmin sub quad-trees in Fig. 2 , 4 Fmax logical peers on the 5th level of our quad-tree. Let X be the number of logical peers between F min and F max in our quad-tree, X¼4 Fmin Â 4 Fmax−Fminþ1 −1=3. Each peer in our quad-tree needs to match its best logical position according to the semantic metric given in Eq. (3) by broadcasting its semantic information based on epidemic theory. Let Y denote the number of physical peers in SON_LSII. We let N¼ max{X,Y}. Let Num_Cache denote the number of caches at each exchange. We assume that Num_Cycle is the number of cycles required for SON_LSII to converge. We use a set containing N elements to denote the N states of information exchange. Let M denote the actual total time for SON_LSII to converge. It is easy to see that Num_Cycle¼M/N. Let i denote the current number of information exchanges. Then we divide this set into two subsets:{U,V}. The elements in set U know the news or are infected, whereas the elements in set V do not know the news or are not infected. Let u(i) and v(i) denote the number of elements in the subset {U,V} at the ith information exchange, where u(i)+v(i)¼N.",
          "It is easy to see that the value, u(i), can be incremented by one or remain unchanged by an exchange of information. Let random variable ϕ i ¼ {0,1} denote the increasing value of the ith information exchange and p i denotes the probability of",
          "Here we delve deeply into the convergence speed based on the stochastic process theory and consider the following four cases:",
          "• Case A (no cache & sequential): a peer selects another peer from the remaining N-1 peers and the N peers run the protocol sequentially. • Case B (cache and sequential): a peer selects another peer from its cache of Num_Cache peers and the N peers run the protocol sequentially. • Case C (no cache and parallel): a peer selects another peer from the remaining N-1 peers and the N peers run the protocol in parallel through the execution of N threads.",
          "• Case D (cache and parallel): a peer selects another peer from its cache of Num_Cache peers and the N peers run the protocol in parallel through the execution of N threads.",
          "The value of λ i may be different for different cases. First, we focus on Case A. Lemma 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. u(i) increases and approaches N exponentially fast according to i. Furthermore, it satisfies the following expression:",
          "Proof. The proof procedure is described in Appendix A. We assume that the actual value of i is M when u(i)-N and SON_LSII converges. It is easy to see that Num_Cycle¼M/N.",
          "In Case B, the tuple (u,v) denotes the ith information exchange between peer u and peer v, ∀u,v∈{U,V}. When u runs the above protocol, the probability of peer u selecting peer v is different from that in Case A, but the difference between the two cases may be ignored. It means that there is an equivalent convergence speed in Cases A and B in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "Proof. We allow each peer to have the information of Num_Cache peers in its local view by complete random assignment during initialization, the distribution of the process of selecting v N times is uniform, i.e., each peer in the set {U,V} has an equal probability p i of being selected during the entire process.",
          "As shown in Lemma 1, there are two factors, I and λ i , that impact u(i). Here, i is the main factor and λ i is minor since i increases according to the law of natural numbers starting at 1, whereas λ i increases by a very small fraction with a max value of about 1/4. So there is an equivalent convergence speed in Cases A and B in terms of the order of magnitude. We have the proof.",
          "Here, we assume that a vector of probability denotes the probability of increasing one element in the set u(i) at an information exchange, and define it as P, P ¼[p 1 ,p 2 ,...p i ...] M .",
          "Considering p i , as in Case A, the random variable ϕ i ¼ {0,1} denotes the increasing value of the ith information exchange and p i denotes the probability of p i ¼{ϕ i ¼1}. In Case C, N peers execute once during a single information exchange procedure since these peers run SON_LSII protocol in parallel with the independent and identically distributed way, which is equivalent to one peer running repeatedly N times, i.e., Bernoulli trial, denoted by B (N,p i ) . The increasing value of u(i) can be denoted by",
          "Theorem 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. In Case C, u(i) increases and approaches N super-exponentially fast according to i based on Lemma 1.",
          "Proof. The proof procedure is described in Appendix B. In summary, u(i) increases according to i and approaches N superexponentially fast in Case C. It is easy to see that there is an equivalent convergence speed in cases C and D in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "The basic idea of the spatial information indexing algorithm is that we first map the spatial information into SON_LSII. Given some requests for indexing information, we compute the semantic value and find the most suitable cluster according to the semantic clustering strategy in Eq. (3) and locate the peer that has the required value in semantic quad-tree layer in a parallel manner based on gossip-based protocol. And then one P2P logical link is created between the peer requesting for indexing information and the peer with the required value so that these two peers can share data with others.",
          "An overview of the indexing algorithm based on SON_LSII is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The whole process comprises two main steps: finding the required information within and outside the current semantic quad-tree. The time complexity of this indexing algorithm isOðlog 2 T þ log 4 NÞ, where T and N are the numbers of peers in the Chord ring layer and the semantic quad-tree layer, respectively.",
          "This section focuses on evaluating the benefits of SON_LSII. We compare SON_LSII with DQTChord introduced in (Tanin et al., 2007) , which does not consider a peer's semantics.",
          "To understand the proposed communication protocol given in Section 3.2, we simulate push-gossip of the anti-entropy epidemic protocol in MatLab. The terms: u(i), v(i), N and Num_Cycle have the same meanings as in Section 3.3. Let P i denote the probability that a fixed node is not infected at the ith cycle,P i ¼ ðvðiÞ=NÞ. Assuming that N ¼10 4 and P 0 ¼ 0.99, we test v(i) ten times. From Fig. 4 , we can see that v(i) decreases exponentially according to i for the data sets of practical 1 and practical 2. And the practical convergence speed for the different data sets of practical 3∼practical 10 is similar to the above results. Next we analyze the theoretical convergence speed (Demers et al., 1987) . Setting P i ¼ P i−1 ð1− 1 N Þ Nð1−P i−1 Þ ; uð0Þ ¼ 1 we carried out an experiment under the same conditions as that in Fig. 4 too. The results show that the speed of practical convergence is equivalent to the theoretical value from the point of view of order of magnitude for the data sets of theoretic 1 and theoretic 2. And the convergence speed in theory for the different data sets of theoretic 3 $ theoretic 10 is similar to the above results.",
          "We also tested the convergence speed for different values of P 0 , P 0 ¼0.9, 0.99, 0.999, respectively. Each experiment was repeated 10 times and the results averaged. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the convergence speed is faster when the initial value of P 0 is smaller.",
          "From the analysis above, we can easily see that the convergence speed of the anti-entropy epidemic protocol is exponentially fast and SON_LSII protocol is identical to the anti-entropy epidemic protocol in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "To further evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we developed a P2P simulator platform for a spatial data application, called PeerSimSD, which is an extension of PeerSim (PeerSim, 2011) . Furthermore, the research study in (Cheng et al., unpublished) achieved the outstanding award of team graduate design in Jiangsu Province, China. To run the protocol sequentially, PeerSimSD uses a queue based on an event driven engine to simulate the environment of Case B in Section 3.3. We use randomly generated data to simulate 10,000 queries of spatial data. ",
          "We collect the data from each peer's view during convergence with Num_Cache¼10. The average path length and clustering coefficient of SON_LSII can be obtained as shown in Fig. 6 . Note that the average clustering coefficient is about 0.21 while the average path length is about 2.36 when network size is 2^10; the Max average clustering coefficient is about 0.70 when network size is 2^5 and the Max average path length is about 2.70 when Network size is 2^12. These results show that SON_LSII has desirable small-world properties similar to those in (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) .",
          "In Section 3.3, we explained that Num_Cache has an impact on the convergence speed although the impact is not significant. Now we focus on this impact under different conditions of simple peak propagation with different values of Num_Cache. First, we set Num_Cache¼1 and observed the convergence. As shown in Table 1 , we found that the overlay network is not a connected graph with high probability. Next, we set Num_Cache¼ 2. And then we found that the overlay network is a connected graph with high probability, while the convergence speed is slower. Finally, we set 2o Num_CacheoN, for example, 10, 20, 40 or 80, and observed the cycle of convergence (Num_Cycle) for different network sizes. The results in Table 2 show that Num_Cache has no significant impact on the convergence speed, which are consistent with the analysis of Case B in Section 3.3.",
          "Here we observe the indexing efficiency varying according to both time and network size using different indexing strategies, such as the GetNear strategy and indexing cache strategy.",
          "As shown in Fig. 7 , SON_LSII is stable with respect to variations in time. Furthermore, the way \"SON_LSII_Cache_GetNear\" uses our indexing strategy \"GetNear strategy and indexing cache strategy\" is superior to the others, and the average indexing logical hops is between 2.8 and 4, which is lower than the other cases.",
          "To test whether SON_LSII is stable with respect to variations in network size from 1 to 50,000, we record the minimal, mean, and maximal logical hops, which are approximate 1.1, 8.2 and 11.1 without much change, respectively. These results show that SON_LSII works well.",
          "In order to compare our indexing method, we introduce another famous spatial indexing method DQTChord (Tanin et al., 2007) . Our approach differs from it in that, DQTChord maps all control points to the Chord ring, whereas we let the Chord ring act as the first location function and place the remaining indexes in the semantic quad-tree layer, which is the second level of SON_LSII. This decreases the indexing stress on the Chord ring and results in some spatial information query tasks being completed within one group of the semantic quad-tree thereby improving the indexing efficiency of the spatial information.",
          "According to Fig. 8 , the hit rate for spatial information indexing approaches 100% with an increase in time units. Furthermore, we can also see that the way \"SON_LSII_Cache_GetNear\" uses the GetNear and indexing cache strategies achieves a higher hit rate for spatial information indexing than DQTChord. This is because we often query data close to previous data with a higher probability when scanning certain spatial data such as map data. In the first 1000 time units, we simulate data queries/inserts. In the latter 1000 time units, there is a higher probability that data is repeated in SON_LSII. ",
          "The goal of SON_LSII is to provide fast spatial information indexing for a massive number of concurrent users. The more the number of users is, the greater the size of network is. Let us carry out some experiments to test whether SON_LSII adapts with the dynamic change of the network size and whether the Network load distribution is balanced.",
          "5.2.4.1. Dynamic character. Considering the fact that users of SON_LSII join and leave dynamically, we investigated the adaptability of SON_LSII. We assume that the network size increases or decreases in steps of 10.",
          "As shown in Fig. 9 , there are three kinds of experimental data: SON_LSII (the indexing method for SON_LSII without dynamic changes), SON_LSII_Dynamics (the indexing method for SON_LSII with dynamic changes) and DQTChord. In this figure, the x-axis denotes time units and the y-axis denotes the hit rate. From the results of the experiment, it can be seen that dynamic changes in the network size have no effect on the hit rate.",
          "Here we express the network load in terms of the frequency with which each peer is accessed in SON_LSII during a certain period.",
          "In Fig. 10 , the x-axis denotes the network load of the peers, while the y-axis gives the number of peers corresponding to the network load. The network load in SON_LSII is better balanced. This is because the responsibility of indexing is assigned to some peers in our semantic quad-tree and all data are divided into four parts and evenly mapped onto the Chord ring and semantic quad-tree layers.",
          "In this paper, we proposed an effective semantic clustering strategy and presented the design of a new semantic overlay network (SON_LSII) that enables more powerful large-scale spatial information indexing. The SON_LSII has a hybrid structure that results in our indexing method achieving a very competitive tradeoff between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead.",
          "We have carried out more experiments over the Internet with massive amounts of actual spatial raster data. However, vector spatial data cannot be directly divided using the method mentioned above since it needs to record the topological relation between the vector spatial objects. As future work, we plan to extend SON_LSII for more practical applications, especially in online services of vector spatial data. Appendix A. The proof procedure of Lemma 1 Lemma 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. u(i) increases and approaches N exponentially fast according to i. Furthermore, it satisfies the following expression:",
          "Proof. Assume that we start analyzing from the ith information exchange and let SON_LSII protocol run for Δi information exchanges. This gives the following equation:",
          "uði þ ΔiÞ−uðiÞ ¼ ½λ i vðiÞuðiÞΔi",
          "If u(0)¼ u 0 , C ¼ N u 0 −1 and the proof is complete. It should be noted that we assume that λ i does not change in the above proof. In fact, λ i does change to some extent. Next, we analyze this change from i¼ 1.",
          "In Case A,",
          "Consider the factor function f¼ x(N−x) ¼x Â N−x Â x. Formally, the derivative of function f is f′¼ N−2 Â x40,1≤x o N/2,f↑.",
          "And then we can get 1 ≤",
          "Therefore, λ i ↑,u i oN/2，and the expectation of u(i) increasing is at least λ i , where λ i ¼ 1 þ ∑ i k ¼ 1 λ k , while λ max ¼ N=4ðN−1Þ; u i ¼ N=2; and then, λ i decreases to zero after several information exchanges. Finally, by substituting λ i in the equation, we have the proof.",

          "Proof. Let we analyze λ i starting with i¼1.",
          "Similarly, we can obtain the value of λ i at the i th information exchange as follows:",
          "According to Lemma 1, by substituting λ i for u(i), the u(i) are obtained as follows: uðiÞ ¼ N 1 1þCe −iλ i 4 N 1 1þCe −i2 i , under the condition that ∑ i j ¼ 1 λ j o N=2, where the constant C can be obtained using u (0)¼ 1. We have the proof."

          "Overlay networks are recognized as a way of improving Internet services in many fields, most of which only related to onedimensional data (Hu et al., 2008; Tanin et al., 2007; Jelasity et al., 2009) . With the increase in demand for online services of spatial information, the challenges of fast indexing in distributed networks has become a hot research topic in the combined field of Computer Science and Geographic Information Science. The indexing information involves multi-dimensional data, the corresponding online services of which are becoming increasingly more complicated, especially in that they require complex spatial extent data (e.g. BBox, Bounding Box) with a massive number of concurrent users through network browser. For example, there exist a massive number of concurrent queries for spatial extent data about the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in the spring of 2003. The GIS (Geographic Information Systems) based on browser/server (Gogu et al., 2006) cannot efficiently support these large-scale spatial information queries and indexing since the central GIS server unavoidably suffers with hotspot bottleneck and single point of failure (Wu et al., 2010) . Here term large-scale means the number of concurrent users is very large, maybe up to thousands or even millions. There exists a contradiction between hotspot bottleneck of GIS server and a massive number of concurrent users for spatial information queries. This scientific problem has not yet been solved completely. Therefore, various new methods have been investigated to address this problem.",
          "Distributed computing technologies such as Grid computing, Cloud computing and overlay networks are mainly used to support large-scale spatial information indexing. In Grid computing, there is often a central management for resource management and work load allocation. Therefore, compared with Grid computing, overlay networks have the advantages of dynamicity and scalable selfconfiguration (Foster and Iamnitchi, 2003) . Cloud computing is another computing model that distributes computing tasks in a resource pool based on a central computer cluster (Mateescu et al., 2011) . Contrary to Cloud computing, overlay networks can make full use of idle computing resources of many endpoints (Tanin et al., 2007; Jelasity et al., 2005 Jelasity et al., , 2009 Kantere et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) .",
          "Regarding spatial data network processing, Tanin et al. (2006 Tanin et al. ( , 2007 presented their preliminary work, DQTChord, which is the work most closely related to our study. In this paper, we compare our approach with DQTChord, in which the spatial data is first divided based on Distributed Quad-Tree, and then mapped onto a Chord. Our approach differs from theirs in that we use a hybrid structure for the overlay network, which includes two layers and considers semantic information. Peers with similar semantics in our semantic overlay network are organized into same peer clusters, which make sharing information among peers more efficiently. The benefits of our approach include a decreased indexing load and increased indexing efficiency. Other related works include (Hu et al., 2008) , which uses the P2P framework FLoD to 3D scene streaming for virtual globe applications, and Kantere et al., 2009 , which use SPATIALP2P, a totally decentralized framework for spatial data built on top of a one-dimensional DHT. In (Zhang et al., 2009) a swift tree structure for multidimensional data indexing is proposed, which has a query efficiency of O(logN) in terms of routing hops and an low maintenance cost. Our spatial information indexing is substantially different. It is based on a semantic overlay network with a multi-layer structure.",
          "As for semantic overlays (Resnik, 1999; Doulkeridis et al., 2007; Tirado et al., 2010) , Resnik (1999) presented a measure based on the notion of information contexts. An algorithm for the distributed and decentralized construction of hierarchical SONs in unstructured P2P networks is presented by Doulkeridis et al. (2007) , which is a distributed method of clustering content in a recursive way. Tirado et al. (2010) proposed an affinity AP2P, which is similar to our approach. It uses a novel affinity-based metric to estimate the distance between clusters of nodes sharing similar content. However, there are two main differences from AP2P. First, we define the different semantic similarity function for spatial information. Second, we introduce the epidemic protocol for overlay construction.",
          "There is a large amount of general purpose literature on epidemic protocols and small world networks. Some authors present general protocols based on gossip and the theoretic foundation of epidemics while our work focuses on spatial information indexing (Jelasity et al., 2005 (Jelasity et al., , 2009 Demers et al., 1987; Fabrikant et al., 2002; Renesse et al., 2008) . Other authors introduce the theory and methods for small world networks, which is the theoretical foundation for our research work (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Li et al., 2008) .",
          "In this paper, we introduce a spatial data indexing mechanism, which is based on a semantic overlay network. This network is connected by logical links between peers in a semantic quad-tree topology, which is a small world network with a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient. In our semantic quad-tree, peers with similar semantics are organized into same peer clusters, which can be further adaptively arranged into a small world network. According to this semantic proximity, we can dynamically construct the topology of an overlay network in a robust, dependable manner based on our previous work, i.e., HPSIN and SDI-CDQT (Wu et al., 2010; Zou et al., 2011) . In (Wu et al., 2010) a HPSIN was proposed by us, which combines distributed quad-tree with distributed hash table (DHT) to maintain both query efficiency and system load balance. Based on our HPSIN, we further propose a SDI-CDQT extending the quad-tree layer in HPSIN by semantic clustering strategy (Zou et al., 2011) , which makes the peers with similar interesting belong to the same cluster. However, there exist insufficiencies under a massive number of concurrent users indexing since both HPSIN and SDI-CDQT did not effectively consider the construction of overlay network for large-scale spatial information indexing. To our best knowledge, there lacks effective fast construction protocol of overlay network and the corresponding theoretical analysis for spatial information indexing.",
          "The main contributions of this paper are thereby four-fold 1) An effective semantic clustering strategy based on a uniform semantic metric is adopted that make peers with similar interests organized in same clusters. 2) A new semantic overlay network and the corresponding construction protocol based on gossip for large-scale spatial information indexing (SON_LSII) are proposed. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis of the convergence speed of SON_LSII is formally presented from four cases. The SON_LSII supports a massive number of concurrent users indexing and is a small world overlay network that achieves a very competitive tradeoff between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead. 3) We propose efficient algorithms to support large-scale range queries of the spatial information in a parallel manner based on SON_LSII framework. 4) Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of SON_LSII with regard to various aspects, including scalability, rate of indexing hits, indexing logical hops, adaptability, and so on.",
          "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of our system. In Section 3, we discuss our theoretical model of a semantic overlay network and an analysis thereof. Section 4 details the large-scale spatial information indexing algorithm based on a semantic overlay network. In Section 5 we give the theoretical and experimental results that characterize key properties of this overlay network and a performance analysis of our algorithm. Section 6 presents our conclusions and future work.",
          "Before describing SON_LSII model in detail, we present an overview of our system. While there exist some different points from HPSIN as described in Section 1.3, the system structure of SON_LSII is similar to HPSIN (Wu et al., 2010) , which is a hybrid structure including Chord Ring Layer and Semantic Quad-tree Layer as depicted in Fig. 1 . Differing from the DQTChord (Distributed Quad-Tree Chord) structure (Tanin et al., 2007) , our hybrid structure stores subspace data directly in a semantic quad-tree rather than a Chord ring to reduce the communication cost and enhance indexing efficiency. Fig. 1 depicts the hybrid structure of SON_LSII, which is organized in layered clustering method. First, we place the head peer of the semantic cluster into the Chord ring layer according to the semantics of spatial information that peer holds. And then, in semantic quad-tree, we let each head peer maintain a cluster of four neighboring peers based on a uniform k-element Semantic Vector (SV) where k is some constant. The two main aspects of the semantic space correspond to two sub-SVs, SV 1 and SV 2 . SV¼{SV 1 , SV 2 }¼ e 11 ; e 12 ; …; e 1k 1 È É ; e 21 ; e 22 ; …; e 2k 2 È É È É , k 1 +k 2 ¼ k. Note that Semantic Vector corresponds to a point in the semantic space while the word \"semantic\" here means that the element in SV and the point in the semantic space both contain some concrete feature or attribute, which is represented by one element e ij in the SV with the data object including a weight ij . SV 1 and SV 2 correspond to two aspects, respectively, i.e., the semantic of spatial information that peer holds in overlay network and physical network performances, such as online time and bandwidth. For an example, if there are three peers A,B,C, peer A requests some spatial information that hold by peer B and C, and peer B and C have the same online time, peer A perhaps share data with peer B or peer C. However, if peer B have shorter online time than peer C, peer A would only create one P2P logical link with peer C and share data with peer C. One peer in a semantic overlay network can be regarded as a point in the k-dimensional semantic space. Furthermore, the proximity of two peers can be represented by the Euclidean distance between the two points in the semantic space.",
          "We first present the semantic clustering strategy based on SV, and then we describe the construction of SON_LSII. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence speed of SON_LSII model.",
          "As described above, SV¼{SV 1 , SV 2 }, semantics in SV 1 includes the semantics of spatial information held by the peers, such as the extent, resolution, and layer of spatial data, and the meaning of SV 2 lies in the peers' network performance, such as online time and bandwidth, which are gotten from the metadata in its caches' history information. As for the values and corresponding weights of elements in the SV 1 , especially for the element in-spatial extent data, we firstly need one method to map these multidimensional data into one-dimensional data. Therefore, we propose a novel mapping method, called Adaptive Spatial Information Linearization (ASIL).",
          "A spatial object typically has an extent with multi-dimensional features and cannot easily be linearized into a one-dimensional data value. The Hilbert curve or Z-curve can be used to map a regularly coordinated multi-dimensional spatial data space into a lowdimensional space (Li et al., 2008) . However, in our case, the SV includes both SV 1 and SV 2 . We introduce the ASIL method to map the spatial data space into one control point (CP) uniquely (Tanin et al., 2007) , and then let this point be an element in the SV 1 . Furthermore, combined with SV 2 , we can get the point in the uniform semantic space corresponding to SV for each peer.",
          "The method for mapping the spatial data space into one element in the SV 1 uses the minimal boxes bounding the spatial object, i.e. BBox. Considering the Semantic Vector consists of many elements while spatial extent only is one kind of elements, therefore, we use a BBox to map spatial extent to one-dimensional control point. For any spatial extent, we can get one unique control point from the center of its BBox. Whether a spatial object is a polygon or a polyline, there exists a minimal BBox for this spatial object. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of two spatial objects and the corresponding BBox and CP. The spatial object in BBox A comprises one CP O 1 at level 1 and four recursive space subdivisions A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , respectively. The spatial object in BBox B is divided two levels: the CP O 1 corresponds to level 1 and the CPs O 11 , O 12 , O 13 and O 14 correspond to level 2.",
          "According to the semantic proximity value, a peer can decide which cluster to join. In order to compute the semantic proximity and find its location in our k-dimensional semantic space, all values and weights in the SV need to be obtained. Some values and weights of elements can be derived from the metadata, including the resolution and layer. The other values and weights of key elements in the SV, such as the extent of spatial data, are not easily obtained, and thus we propose a method to compute these. From the ASIL given above, we know that the spatial data's extent can be uniquely represented by its CP. We define Eq. (1) to compute the semantic proximity value between two CPs, CPx and CPy, and Eq. (2) to compute the value of its corresponding weight.",
          "Following the theory in Sheldom (2009), Zou et al. (2011) , the more information two CPs share, the more similar they are. Equation (1) expresses the semantics of one layer in the whole division, where Set(CPx,CPy) is the common super class set of CPx and CPy, T is one element of control point, P(T) is the probability of T emerging in all level, CPNum is the emerging number of control point NSCP, N is the total number of all control points. Equation (2) expresses statistical weight for each similarity including the semantics in various layers, where N i is the number of CPs in the ith layer, and ∑ j o Fmax j ¼ Fmin N j is the total number of CPs between the F max and F min layers. F max and F min express the maximum and minimum number of subdivision levels, respectively.",
          "So far, the values and corresponding weights of k-dimensional elements in the SV can be obtained, which is a uniform semantic metric. According to Eq. (3), where k 1 , k 2 , weight ij and e ij are defined in Section 2, when a new peer with similar semantics wishes to join SON_LSII, it first determines the most suitable cluster and then selects the semantic position with the maximum semantic metric in this cluster.",
          "In contrast to the random joining strategy adopted in other overlay networks, this semantic clustering strategy takes advantage of the homogeneity between peers and reduces the indexing cost.",
          "Based on the semantic clustering strategy, we give a fast construction protocol, by which peers with similar semantics are organized in the same peer cluster and further adaptively arranged into a small world semantic network -SON_LSII.",
          "There are two kinds of key protocols in building SON_LSII: a key-based routing protocol in the Chord ring layer and a gossipbased protocol in the semantic quad-tree layer. Using a key-based routing protocol, the centroid position in semantic subspace SV 1 can be hashed to address locations in the Chord ring. This routing protocol exhibits promising load-balancing behavior while without taking advantage of the homogeneity between data objects. Therefore, we introduce a clustering strategy based on the gossip protocol in the semantic quad-tree layer allowing SON_LSII to adapt dynamically to the locality of the data distribution and retain good load-balancing behavior at the same time, especially under a massive number of concurrent users.",
          "Herein we focus on the gossip-based protocol, which is extended according to the newscast model of computation (Jelasity et al., 2005 (Jelasity et al., , 2009 ) using the value of the metric in Eq. (3) as the clustering strategy. In this protocol, all peers periodically exchange their descriptors with other peers, thereby constantly improving their local partial views. Let α denote the local partial views, where α(i) denotes the local partial views of peer i, α(i)¼α(i)⊕α(j) denotes the merger operation of the local partial views of peers i and j, and rank(α(i),j) denotes the operation of sorting the local partial views of peer i according to the interesting metric of peer j.",
          "The basic idea of the protocol is as follows:",
          "(1) initialize the α(i) of each peer i, i¼{1,2,…N};",
          "(2) periodically wait δ time units;",
          "(3) peer i selects its child peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 } from the α(i);",
          "(4) update α(i) by α(i)¼ α(i)⊕α(j),j¼{p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 };",
          "(5) send the updated view α(i) to the peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 }; (6) receive the views from peers {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 } and rank(α(i),j),j¼ {p 1 ,p 2 ,p 3 ,p 4 }; (7) repeat from step 2 until the perfect target SON_LSII is obtained.",
          "There are several critical steps that need to be addressed in the protocol for SON_LSII: (i) steps 5 and 6 must be executed as separate threads, thereby supporting massive concurrency of peers. (ii) The perfect target SON_LSII in step 7 means that each peer that differs from the root in the F min layer of SON_LSII must know its parent, while non-leaf peers must know their four children.",
          "Differing from the empirical method in (Jelasity et al., 2009) , we introduce stochastic processes to describe the relationship between convergence speed and network size of SON_LSII model under different cases (Sheldom, 1983) .",
          "Let F min ¼2 and F max ¼ 5 in Fig. 2, i.e., there are 4 Fmin sub quad-trees in Fig. 2 , 4 Fmax logical peers on the 5th level of our quad-tree. Let X be the number of logical peers between F min and F max in our quad-tree, X¼4 Fmin Â 4 Fmax−Fminþ1 −1=3. Each peer in our quad-tree needs to match its best logical position according to the semantic metric given in Eq. (3) by broadcasting its semantic information based on epidemic theory. Let Y denote the number of physical peers in SON_LSII. We let N¼ max{X,Y}. Let Num_Cache denote the number of caches at each exchange. We assume that Num_Cycle is the number of cycles required for SON_LSII to converge. We use a set containing N elements to denote the N states of information exchange. Let M denote the actual total time for SON_LSII to converge. It is easy to see that Num_Cycle¼M/N. Let i denote the current number of information exchanges. Then we divide this set into two subsets:{U,V}. The elements in set U know the news or are infected, whereas the elements in set V do not know the news or are not infected. Let u(i) and v(i) denote the number of elements in the subset {U,V} at the ith information exchange, where u(i)+v(i)¼N.",
          "It is easy to see that the value, u(i), can be incremented by one or remain unchanged by an exchange of information. Let random variable ϕ i ¼ {0,1} denote the increasing value of the ith information exchange and p i denotes the probability of",
          "Here we delve deeply into the convergence speed based on the stochastic process theory and consider the following four cases:",
          "• Case A (no cache & sequential): a peer selects another peer from the remaining N-1 peers and the N peers run the protocol sequentially. • Case B (cache and sequential): a peer selects another peer from its cache of Num_Cache peers and the N peers run the protocol sequentially. • Case C (no cache and parallel): a peer selects another peer from the remaining N-1 peers and the N peers run the protocol in parallel through the execution of N threads.",
          "• Case D (cache and parallel): a peer selects another peer from its cache of Num_Cache peers and the N peers run the protocol in parallel through the execution of N threads.",
          "The value of λ i may be different for different cases. First, we focus on Case A. Lemma 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. u(i) increases and approaches N exponentially fast according to i. Furthermore, it satisfies the following expression:",
          "Proof. The proof procedure is described in Appendix A. We assume that the actual value of i is M when u(i)-N and SON_LSII converges. It is easy to see that Num_Cycle¼M/N.",
          "In Case B, the tuple (u,v) denotes the ith information exchange between peer u and peer v, ∀u,v∈{U,V}. When u runs the above protocol, the probability of peer u selecting peer v is different from that in Case A, but the difference between the two cases may be ignored. It means that there is an equivalent convergence speed in Cases A and B in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "Proof. We allow each peer to have the information of Num_Cache peers in its local view by complete random assignment during initialization, the distribution of the process of selecting v N times is uniform, i.e., each peer in the set {U,V} has an equal probability p i of being selected during the entire process.",
          "As shown in Lemma 1, there are two factors, I and λ i , that impact u(i). Here, i is the main factor and λ i is minor since i increases according to the law of natural numbers starting at 1, whereas λ i increases by a very small fraction with a max value of about 1/4. So there is an equivalent convergence speed in Cases A and B in terms of the order of magnitude. We have the proof.",
          "Here, we assume that a vector of probability denotes the probability of increasing one element in the set u(i) at an information exchange, and define it as P, P ¼[p 1 ,p 2 ,...p i ...] M .",
          "Considering p i , as in Case A, the random variable ϕ i ¼ {0,1} denotes the increasing value of the ith information exchange and p i denotes the probability of p i ¼{ϕ i ¼1}. In Case C, N peers execute once during a single information exchange procedure since these peers run SON_LSII protocol in parallel with the independent and identically distributed way, which is equivalent to one peer running repeatedly N times, i.e., Bernoulli trial, denoted by B (N,p i ) . The increasing value of u(i) can be denoted by",
          "Theorem 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. In Case C, u(i) increases and approaches N super-exponentially fast according to i based on Lemma 1.",
          "Proof. The proof procedure is described in Appendix B. In summary, u(i) increases according to i and approaches N superexponentially fast in Case C. It is easy to see that there is an equivalent convergence speed in cases C and D in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "The basic idea of the spatial information indexing algorithm is that we first map the spatial information into SON_LSII. Given some requests for indexing information, we compute the semantic value and find the most suitable cluster according to the semantic clustering strategy in Eq. (3) and locate the peer that has the required value in semantic quad-tree layer in a parallel manner based on gossip-based protocol. And then one P2P logical link is created between the peer requesting for indexing information and the peer with the required value so that these two peers can share data with others.",
          "An overview of the indexing algorithm based on SON_LSII is illustrated in Fig. 3 . The whole process comprises two main steps: finding the required information within and outside the current semantic quad-tree. The time complexity of this indexing algorithm isOðlog 2 T þ log 4 NÞ, where T and N are the numbers of peers in the Chord ring layer and the semantic quad-tree layer, respectively.",
          "This section focuses on evaluating the benefits of SON_LSII. We compare SON_LSII with DQTChord introduced in (Tanin et al., 2007) , which does not consider a peer's semantics.",
          "To understand the proposed communication protocol given in Section 3.2, we simulate push-gossip of the anti-entropy epidemic protocol in MatLab. The terms: u(i), v(i), N and Num_Cycle have the same meanings as in Section 3.3. Let P i denote the probability that a fixed node is not infected at the ith cycle,P i ¼ ðvðiÞ=NÞ. Assuming that N ¼10 4 and P 0 ¼ 0.99, we test v(i) ten times. From Fig. 4 , we can see that v(i) decreases exponentially according to i for the data sets of practical 1 and practical 2. And the practical convergence speed for the different data sets of practical 3∼practical 10 is similar to the above results. Next we analyze the theoretical convergence speed (Demers et al., 1987) . Setting P i ¼ P i−1 ð1− 1 N Þ Nð1−P i−1 Þ ; uð0Þ ¼ 1 we carried out an experiment under the same conditions as that in Fig. 4 too. The results show that the speed of practical convergence is equivalent to the theoretical value from the point of view of order of magnitude for the data sets of theoretic 1 and theoretic 2. And the convergence speed in theory for the different data sets of theoretic 3 $ theoretic 10 is similar to the above results.",
          "We also tested the convergence speed for different values of P 0 , P 0 ¼0.9, 0.99, 0.999, respectively. Each experiment was repeated 10 times and the results averaged. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the convergence speed is faster when the initial value of P 0 is smaller.",
          "From the analysis above, we can easily see that the convergence speed of the anti-entropy epidemic protocol is exponentially fast and SON_LSII protocol is identical to the anti-entropy epidemic protocol in terms of the order of magnitude.",
          "To further evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we developed a P2P simulator platform for a spatial data application, called PeerSimSD, which is an extension of PeerSim (PeerSim, 2011) . Furthermore, the research study in (Cheng et al., unpublished) achieved the outstanding award of team graduate design in Jiangsu Province, China. To run the protocol sequentially, PeerSimSD uses a queue based on an event driven engine to simulate the environment of Case B in Section 3.3. We use randomly generated data to simulate 10,000 queries of spatial data. ",
          "We collect the data from each peer's view during convergence with Num_Cache¼10. The average path length and clustering coefficient of SON_LSII can be obtained as shown in Fig. 6 . Note that the average clustering coefficient is about 0.21 while the average path length is about 2.36 when network size is 2^10; the Max average clustering coefficient is about 0.70 when network size is 2^5 and the Max average path length is about 2.70 when Network size is 2^12. These results show that SON_LSII has desirable small-world properties similar to those in (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) .",
          "In Section 3.3, we explained that Num_Cache has an impact on the convergence speed although the impact is not significant. Now we focus on this impact under different conditions of simple peak propagation with different values of Num_Cache. First, we set Num_Cache¼1 and observed the convergence. As shown in Table 1 , we found that the overlay network is not a connected graph with high probability. Next, we set Num_Cache¼ 2. And then we found that the overlay network is a connected graph with high probability, while the convergence speed is slower. Finally, we set 2o Num_CacheoN, for example, 10, 20, 40 or 80, and observed the cycle of convergence (Num_Cycle) for different network sizes. The results in Table 2 show that Num_Cache has no significant impact on the convergence speed, which are consistent with the analysis of Case B in Section 3.3.",
          "Here we observe the indexing efficiency varying according to both time and network size using different indexing strategies, such as the GetNear strategy and indexing cache strategy.",
          "As shown in Fig. 7 , SON_LSII is stable with respect to variations in time. Furthermore, the way \"SON_LSII_Cache_GetNear\" uses our indexing strategy \"GetNear strategy and indexing cache strategy\" is superior to the others, and the average indexing logical hops is between 2.8 and 4, which is lower than the other cases.",
          "To test whether SON_LSII is stable with respect to variations in network size from 1 to 50,000, we record the minimal, mean, and maximal logical hops, which are approximate 1.1, 8.2 and 11.1 without much change, respectively. These results show that SON_LSII works well.",
          "In order to compare our indexing method, we introduce another famous spatial indexing method DQTChord (Tanin et al., 2007) . Our approach differs from it in that, DQTChord maps all control points to the Chord ring, whereas we let the Chord ring act as the first location function and place the remaining indexes in the semantic quad-tree layer, which is the second level of SON_LSII. This decreases the indexing stress on the Chord ring and results in some spatial information query tasks being completed within one group of the semantic quad-tree thereby improving the indexing efficiency of the spatial information.",
          "According to Fig. 8 , the hit rate for spatial information indexing approaches 100% with an increase in time units. Furthermore, we can also see that the way \"SON_LSII_Cache_GetNear\" uses the GetNear and indexing cache strategies achieves a higher hit rate for spatial information indexing than DQTChord. This is because we often query data close to previous data with a higher probability when scanning certain spatial data such as map data. In the first 1000 time units, we simulate data queries/inserts. In the latter 1000 time units, there is a higher probability that data is repeated in SON_LSII. ",
          "The goal of SON_LSII is to provide fast spatial information indexing for a massive number of concurrent users. The more the number of users is, the greater the size of network is. Let us carry out some experiments to test whether SON_LSII adapts with the dynamic change of the network size and whether the Network load distribution is balanced.",
          "5.2.4.1. Dynamic character. Considering the fact that users of SON_LSII join and leave dynamically, we investigated the adaptability of SON_LSII. We assume that the network size increases or decreases in steps of 10.",
          "As shown in Fig. 9 , there are three kinds of experimental data: SON_LSII (the indexing method for SON_LSII without dynamic changes), SON_LSII_Dynamics (the indexing method for SON_LSII with dynamic changes) and DQTChord. In this figure, the x-axis denotes time units and the y-axis denotes the hit rate. From the results of the experiment, it can be seen that dynamic changes in the network size have no effect on the hit rate.",
          "Here we express the network load in terms of the frequency with which each peer is accessed in SON_LSII during a certain period.",
          "In Fig. 10 , the x-axis denotes the network load of the peers, while the y-axis gives the number of peers corresponding to the network load. The network load in SON_LSII is better balanced. This is because the responsibility of indexing is assigned to some peers in our semantic quad-tree and all data are divided into four parts and evenly mapped onto the Chord ring and semantic quad-tree layers.",
          "In this paper, we proposed an effective semantic clustering strategy and presented the design of a new semantic overlay network (SON_LSII) that enables more powerful large-scale spatial information indexing. The SON_LSII has a hybrid structure that results in our indexing method achieving a very competitive tradeoff between indexing efficiency and maintenance overhead.",
          "We have carried out more experiments over the Internet with massive amounts of actual spatial raster data. However, vector spatial data cannot be directly divided using the method mentioned above since it needs to record the topological relation between the vector spatial objects. As future work, we plan to extend SON_LSII for more practical applications, especially in online services of vector spatial data. Appendix A. The proof procedure of Lemma 1 Lemma 1. Let N denote all the peers in SON_LSII, and i denote the current number of information exchanges. u(i) increases and approaches N exponentially fast according to i. Furthermore, it satisfies the following expression:",
          "Proof. Assume that we start analyzing from the ith information exchange and let SON_LSII protocol run for Δi information exchanges. This gives the following equation:",
          "uði þ ΔiÞ−uðiÞ ¼ ½λ i vðiÞuðiÞΔi",
          "If u(0)¼ u 0 , C ¼ N u 0 −1 and the proof is complete. It should be noted that we assume that λ i does not change in the above proof. In fact, λ i does change to some extent. Next, we analyze this change from i¼ 1.",

The arithmetic-harmonic cut metric overcoming difficulties other hierarchal methods have in representing both intercluster differences and intracluster similarities.",

          "The medical evaluation of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) involves a combination of non-genetic laboratory and radiographic tests. The former provide little diagnostic or prognostic information [1] . Radiographic evaluations are helpful in diagnosing temporal bone anomalies, but are expensive and require sedation or general anaesthesia in children [2] . Additionally, these tests are time-consuming and stressful for the child and family. Most recently, genetic testing of the GJB2 gene has been added to the diagnostic evaluation. Mutations in this gene account for about 20% of children with nonsyndromic SNHL [3] . Recent data has demonstrated the utility of GJB2 analysis in determining prognosis, the best intervention, and recurrence risks to future children and other family members [4, 5] . Genetic testing can also predict the absence or onset of a syndrome for which the other clinical problems may not be present at birth or early childhood (e.g. adolescent-onset blindness in Usher syndrome). When the genetic etiology can be determined in a large cohort of patients, it will provide a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations that exist for each of the genes examined, which could direct specific therapeutic interventions.",
          "Beyond GJB2, it is uncertain what genetic mutations are the next most prevalent in patients with hearing loss. Other genes thought to play a significant role in childhood hearing loss include SLC26A4 [6] , Usher type 1 genes (e.g. MYO7A, CDH23) [7, 8] and OTOF [9] , though no studies have looked at many genes to appreciate their relative contributions. The identification of over 45 genes causative for SNHL now makes it imperative to develop a high-throughput resequencing assay. Such a technology would allow for a more comprehensive and therefore higher yield diagnostic evaluation of the etiology of hearing loss in patients. Current technology allows for widespread screening of only the most common genes related to SNHL (i.e. GJB2).",
          "Recent advances in molecular microarray technology have made it feasible to rapidly screen DNA samples for thousands of possible genetic mutations [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The advantages of microarray-based screening include its accuracy, simplicity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness when employed on a large scale. However, call rates among different microarray designs may vary considerably [11, 15, 16] . While computational methods for reduction in false positives due to systematic effects have previously been proposed [17] , inadequate call coverage is also a considerable limitation of the resequencing array-based approach [13, 15] .",
          "The efficiency of sequence-specific hybridization is dependent on the properties of the probe and target sequences [18] . High GC-content, presence of a nearby SNP and cross-hybridizing sequences are known to affect base-calling, thus limiting the capacity of resequencing microarrays. It has been shown that C-rich probes perform better than the complementary G-rich probes [19] . Additionally, it has been reported that nearly 80% of no-calls can be resolved by visual inspection of the intensities as one of the strands provides a clear signature for these positions [13] . However, there are no existing computational approaches that leverage such sequence-specific characteristics in an attempt to resolve GSEQ no-calls that have a distinct signature on one strand but are still ruled no-call due to improper hybridization on the complementary strand.",
          "GSEQ is known to produce very few false negatives, thus providing a highly sensitive test. However, followup dideoxy sequencing for resolution of no-calls leads to an additional variable cost, a factor which needs to be carefully considered for clinical application of the technology. To this effect, we propose a novel algorithm for resolution of no-calls from GSEQ. It should be noted that the algorithm is not designed to be an alternative to GSEQ. Instead, it provides an optional step for salvaging unresolved bases from GSEQ before initiating confirmatory dideoxy sequencing.",
          "Our work focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of resequencing arrays as a tool for variant detection and discusses the impact on base-calling of adopting additional computational algorithms and laboratory protocols. This study presents the results from hearing loss arrays developed in two different research facilities and highlights some of the approaches we adopted to enhance the applicability of the arrays in a clinical setting.",
          "The Harvard array contained 8 genes (see Methods). Performance characteristics were determined from data analyzed for a set of 26 arrays run after protocol optimization ( Table 1 ). The average base call rate across the 26 arrays (654,862 bases) was 96.9% using Affymetrix GDAS 2.0. We confirmed every variant call with dideoxy sequencing to determine the false positive rate. On average, about 57 variants were called per array but only 28% were true variants and the rest were false positives. Dideoxy sequencing of 352,618 bases across 14 arrays was performed and the data compared to array calls. Factoring in false negatives and false positives, we obtained an average base call accuracy of 99.82% across the 14 arrays.",
          "The Cincinnati array also contained 8 genes, 3 of which were common to the Harvard array (see Methods). We ran 12 arrays in the pilot batch and characterized array performance. Base call rates for these 12 arrays (315,504 bases) ranged from 82.5% to 96.9% with an average call rate of 91.3% using GSEQ 4.0 (Figures 1 &2). Dideoxy sequencing was performed for 296,296 of the bases and comparison of this data with array calls gave a call accuracy of 99.23% with nearly 180 false positives per array.",
          "When we compared data from Cincinnati and Harvard arrays, the number of no-calls and false positives from the former were found to be higher. Early data from the Harvard arrays had shown that call rate worsened when the fragmentation was incomplete and that the bases most affected were those within the long range PCR fragments. In addition, the reproducibility of the quantity of product from long range PCR was less. Based upon these two factors, the target amplification process for Cincinnati arrays was modified. Instead of using a combination of long and short range PCR (54 fragments ranging from 434 to 13,282 bases in length), as was employed in the pilot batch, all long range PCRs were converted to short range resulting in 180 fragments ranging from 315 to 980 bases in length. The impact of using shorter PCR products was evaluated by comparing array data across the two protocols (Figures 1 &2) . A total of 13 arrays (341,796 bases) were run with the optimized \"short range PCR only\" protocol and an average call rate of 97.9% (range 96.7% to 98.4%) was obtained with GSEQ (Table  1 ). Dideoxy sequencing was performed for 336,171 of the bases and comparison of this data with array calls gave an array call accuracy of 99.83%. The average number of false positives dropped from 180 to 42 per array. The modified protocol with shorter PCR products was then adopted for subsequent arrays. Figure 1 Improvement in array call rates with protocol optimization and application of sPROFILER to GSEQ calls. (data shown for Cincinnati arrays). Data is separated into two categories based upon protocol (short and long range PCR vs. short range only PCR) and then arranged in ascending order of GSEQ call rates.",
          "Through dideoxy sequencing, we identified four cases with at least one insertion or deletion (35delG/35delG, 35delG/167delT, and M1V/167delT in GJB2 and homozygous 1180_1187del8ins(β-sat) in TMPRSS3), of which 2 had been previously reported and therefore had probes tiled on the array for their detection (GJB2 35delG and 167delT) (Additional file 1). We analyzed array data to look for no-calls or variant calls in the vicinity of the indel sites but did not observe any such patterns for the 35delG and 167delT alleles. It should be noted that the local high GC-content surrounding the 35delG (stretch of 5 Gs; probe GC 56%) and the 167delT (stretch of 4 Cs; probe GC 64%) would be expected to make detection extremely difficult. On the other hand, there was a continuous stretch of 13 nocalls and a variant call spanning the deleted bases of the TMPRSS3 gene that led to the detection of the mutation. We also analyzed raw feature intensities within fragments to see if indels cause degradation in intensities surrounding the variant site. We observed lower peak intensities surrounding the TMPRSS3 mutation but did not find such evidence for either of the single base GJB2 deletions (data not shown). GDAS/GSEQ are currently not designed for identifying indels so their low detection rate was an expected observation.",
          "In agreement with previously reported findings [19, 20] , we observed that an increase in probe G-and C-contents have differential impact on performance. We used complementary feature quartets to determine intensities associated with the C-or G-content of a probe. Intensity characteristics varied differently with respect to an increase in C-or G-content and average peak intensity was affected more severely by a high G-content than by an equally high C-content ( Figure 3a ). In order to assess if our data demonstrated previously reported debilitating effect of stretches of Gs (G-stacks) on probe performance [21] , we compared hybridization intensities among probes with the same G-content grouped based on the presence or absence of G-stretches (≥ 4 Gs in a continuous stretch). For the same G-content, probes with G-stretches produced lower peak intensities than probes with C-stretches or without any stretches of Gs or Cs (Figure 3b ).",
          "Overall array performance with sPROFILER sPROFILER was only used on no-calls from GDAS/ GSEQ. Examined bases were called wild-type based on single-strand evidence or were left as no-calls depending upon the feature intensity profile. Base calls were subsequently compared against GSEQ and dideoxy sequencing calls. to 99.8%) with 99.88% call accuracy and number of nocalls dropped from 563 to 103 (Table 1 ). The number of false positives dropped from 42 to 30 per array with the application of filters to screen variant calls based on low quality scores and the number of no-calls and variant calls in the vicinity. Improvement was achieved at the cost of an additional 0.4 false negative per array. We also calculated the number of exons per array that would need to be interrogated with dideoxy sequencing in order to resolve no-calls and confirm positive calls. After processing GSEQ calls with sPROFILER, the average number of exons to be sequenced in order to clarify no-calls and confirm variants dropped from 150 (range 132 to 165) to 68 (range 52 to 82) per array. When using sPROFILER on the Harvard arrays, the average call rate increased from 96.9% to 99.6% and number of no-calls dropped from 781 to 101 per array (Table 1) . False positive calls could be reduced from 41 to 38 per array with the filters for false positive calls. An additional 0.4 variants were falsely called wild-type using the algorithm. Because all no-calls are followed up by dideoxy sequencing, the implementation of the sPROFI-LER resulted in substantially fewer exons (average of 153 down to 52) needing follow-up.",
          "A detailed list of all variants and associated frequencies in the patient cohorts and control populations is included in Additional file 1. A total of 411 true variants were detected across 26 Harvard arrays, out of which, 10 were called wildtype by GDAS (Table 2) . Interestingly, the 10 missed variants represent a single common SNP (MYO7A 4755T>C) seen in 10 different arrays. As such, it appears that this single substitution may be problematic. The basis of the poor sensitivity for this variant did not appear to be overall high GC-content, which was 52%, nor a local G/C stretch (only one adjacent base was a G). Of the 411 variants, 44 represent rare variants, many of potential clinical significance. None of these were missed by the array, although 12 were assigned no-calls. Of the 192 true variants identified across the 13 optimized Cincinnati arrays, 3 synonymous variants (CDH23 2761C>T, KCNQ1 1185C>T, MYO7A 4831C>T) were called wild-type by GSEQ ( Table 2 ). The CDH23 and MYO7A variants were found to lie within a G/C stretch with probe GC-contents of 68% and 52% respectively but the KCNQ1 variant was not associated with high GC-content or a G/C stretch.",
          "After excluding synonymous and/or common variants, 18/37 patients examined by the Cincinnati array and 9/ 24 patients examined on the Harvard array had at least one variant of potential or likely clinical significance (excludes two cases known to have GJB2 biallelic mutations). See Additional file 1 for a full list of all variants found on a per patient basis. To further assess the likelihood that each variant may be disease-causing, efforts are currently underway to examine these variants in further control studies and using in silico algorithms to predict protein impact. After these studies are completed, variants with potential clinical significance will be confirmed in a CLIA environment with results returned to patients under an IRB approved protocol.",
          "Serial molecular techniques (e.g., direct sequencing, single-strand conformation analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography) have been employed for detection of mutations associated with disorders showing high genetic and allelic heterogeneity but they can be laborious requiring high turnaround times and show little difference in their direct costs per base, which are high [12] . Conventional serial methods can be especially ineffective for screening large genes without definite hot spots for disease-associated mutations [10] . Although new advancements in next generation sequencing will soon replace all large scale sequencing platforms, these technologies are still too costly for medium size applications of targeted disease sequencing. High-density oligonucleotide microarrays provide an efficient and economically competitive method for genetic screening of heterogeneous disorders by allowing parallel resequencing of multiple genes in a single experiment. Since the first study reporting detection of known genomic variants using oligonucleotide arrays [22] , several others have been published describing the principles of resequencing array technology [18, 20, 23, 24] and its application for genotyping in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [25] [26] [27] .",
          "We developed two resequencing microarrays containing 13 unique genes implicated in nonsyndromic SNHL. Array base calls were compared to dideoxy sequencing to determine accuracy. Through optimization of protocols and data analysis methods, similar high-quality performance measures could be achieved for microarrays developed at two independent research facilities and containing different sets of genes.",
          "The critical performance characteristics we attempted to understand and optimize are call rate, sensitivity and specificity. Affymetrix GSEQ is an upgraded version of the GDAS base-calling software and offers some additional features as described in the GSEQ technical datasheet http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/ datasheets/gseq_datasheet.pdf. However, they both employ a base-calling algorithm built upon the adaptive background genotyping-calling scheme (ABACUS) developed by Cutler and colleagues [20] . GDAS and GSEQ produce few false negatives because these algorithms are conservative in making wild-type calls. False positives or no-calls do not represent a lack of test sensitivity when they are followed up by dideoxy sequencing; however, they compromise the cost-effectiveness of the technology if a large amount of sequencing is required. In our hands, the cost reduction is roughly a 25%-50% reduction compared to traditional capillary sequencing when thorough follow-up is employed to resolve all variant calls and rare no-calls. The exact reduction depends on the degree of multiplexing employed in the up-front PCR step and the amount of follow-up sequencing that is needed. The latter factor is unique to each test depending on the sequences included, PCR robustness, the amount of DNA variation in the regions tested and degree of bioinformatics and test optimization that has been achieved.",
          "It has previously been suggested that large PCR amplicons do not hybridize efficiently to immobilized probes possibly due to steric constraints on the approach of the target DNA [28] and this finding has been taken into consideration during design of nucleic acid amplification strategies [29] . Optimizing the target amplification process to include only short range PCR improved the overall array performance in the Cincinnati arrays, thus providing further evidence for the relationship between PCR amplicon length and hybridization efficiency. It should be noted that the data generated by the Harvard arrays was based upon a combination of short range and long range PCR. However, the Harvard group has also discontinued use of long range PCR in subsequently developed array-based sequencing tests. This is because the efforts needed to continually optimize the fragmentation of long range PCR fragments and the additional limitations caused by diminished DNA quantity and variable amplification efficiency in long range PCR do not outweigh the benefits. For most nuclear genes with dispersed exons, only one to a handful of exons can be combined into a long range PCR reaction limiting the efficiency gained by this approach. In contrast, amplification of long stretches of contiguous interrogated DNA, such as that present in the mitochondrial genome, enables the highest efficiency savings for long-range PCR approaches.",
          "Average call rates of 96.9% and 97.7% for all of Harvard arrays and the optimized Cincinnati arrays respectively were achieved using GDAS/GSEQ. Previous resequencing array-based studies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] have reported call rates ranging from 93.5% to 98% with GDAS/GSEQ. While our call rates are within the high end of reported ranges, a large percentage (~80%) of the tiled exons required sequencing to follow-up on ambiguous calls, representing a limitation to clinical application of the technology under the current methodologies.",
          "While it is well known that the GC-content of a probe can impact hybridization http://www.affymetrix.com/ support/technical/technotes/customseq_arraybase_technote.pdf, [11] C-rich probes perform better than G-rich probes for the identical site when complementary strand quartets are compared [19] and fluorescence intensity declines with G-richness of a probe [20] . Additionally, bases within the G-stretch of a probe produce lower peak intensities, especially for stretches with ≥ 4 continuous Gs. It has previously been suggested that probes with multiple Gs in a row (G-stacks) tend to have higher cross-hybridization signals possibly caused by formation of G-quartets due to multiplex binding [21] . Taken together, the above findings imply that sites interrogated with G-rich probes may show stronger signal on the complementary strand employing C-rich probes. By applying additional computer algorithms (sPROFILER) to reduce GDAS/GSEQ no-calls by utilizing a distinct signal on either strand, 86% and 82% of the no-calls could be resolved for Harvard and Cincinnati arrays respectively while maintaining overall accuracy at ≥99.8%.",
          "Mutations in GC-rich regions have previously been reported to be missed [13] . We also observed that variants that could be correctly identified were associated with lower GC-content probes as compared to those that were missed (Additional file 1). Adjusting probe length and positioning a known variable base at either end of the probe have been suggested to improve variant detection in GC-rich regions [13, 30, 27] .",
          "Small indels constitute nearly 24% of disease-causing mutations in the Human Gene Mutation Database as of November 2009 and have been shown to cause severe phenotypic variability [31] [32] [33] . The inability of resequencing arrays to have high sensitivity for detecting novel indels, especially those involving only a few base pairs, presents a significant limitation [10] [11] [12] . Regions showing aberrant hybridization patterns can be selected for confirmatory dideoxy sequencing to potentially detect variations (including indels) that are missed with resequencing arrays. However, as is evident from our data, small indels present challenges as they sometimes do not lead to easily discernible variability in hybridization patterns. After interrogating three different deletions on our arrays, we could detect only the largest deletion through a series of no-calls and a variant call in the region. Further algorithmic and technical improvements could entail development of a scheme for detection of indels by virtue of identifying a regional drop in signal intensity. Although we only observed a single intensity drop for one of the indels included in our validation, modification of the technical protocol to limit the secondary amplification of signal, originally employed to increase detection of low level transcripts in expression arrays, may not be necessary for resequencing arrays interrogating germline nuclear DNA variations present with at least 50% signal compared to wildtype. This protocol modification could lead to better discrimination of signal intensity drops across regions with an indel. In the interim, we have employed clinical oligo hybridization based sequencing technology only for diseases in which most mutations are substitutions (e.g. Noonan syndrome, cardiomyopathy) or the disease is recessive (e.g. hearing loss) in which detection is aimed at finding at least one of the pathogenic variants followed by capillary sequencing of the relevant gene to detect a second mutation that may have been missed.",
          "Although a minor loss in analytical sensitivity is incurred through the use of hybridization based sequencing, this can be balanced with the increased efficiency and diminished cost of this technology compared to traditional approaches. Resequencing array-based mutation detection has been reported to produce a throughput of nearly 100 patients per technician per month and can thus be used as a method for initial genetic screening while being supplemented with conventional dideoxy sequencing for samples in which the array cannot identify a causative mutation [13] . In our hands, this technology has allowed us to cut the cost of testing roughly in half compared to dideoxy capillary sequencing approaches also employed in our clinical laboratories. As such, we have now implemented this technology in four different clinical tests including the HCM Cardio-Chip, DCM CardioChip, Noonan Spectrum Chip, and OtoChip as described on http://pcpgm.partners.org/ lmm.",
          "In conclusion, the described hearing loss gene chips represent the first resequencing arrays for molecular testing of nonsyndromic pediatric SNHL. Using the experimental protocols and additional computation algorithms described here, this technology provides a rapid, cost-effective and reasonably accurate method for identifying known and novel sequence variants in targeted DNA regions. However, follow-up sequencing required to resolve no-calls and false positives does limit the cost-effectiveness of the technology.",
          "All 74 patient samples and clinical information were collected under IRB-approved protocols. Most cases (66) were recruited from clinical centers: 25 patients from Ohio (J. Greinwald), 20 from Massachusetts (H. Rehm and M. Kenna), 12 from Belgium (G. Van Camp), 5 from Israel (K. Avraham), 2 from Iowa (R. Smith), 2 from Nebraska (P. Kelley), and the remaining 8 represented anonymized samples obtained through clinical testing at the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine at the Partners Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine. All patients had previously tested negative for biallelic GJB2 mutations, except for 3 patients who had heterozygous mutations in the GJB2 gene. All patients had bilateral SNHL and were either recessive cases (e.g. with affected siblings) or singletons. DNA and clinical information was collected on most patients (de-identified clinical information for those cases that were anonymized) and included demographic information, audiometric profiles, family history, neuro-otologic history and physical examinations.",
          "To determine what genes to place on a finite resequencing platform that was initially capable of accommodating less than 27,000 bp, we undertook a comprehensive literature search to estimate the likely frequency of mutations in genes known to cause childhood SNHL. Based on the prevalence of mutations in published populations and family studies, the inheritance pattern (s) of mutations (i.e. preference for recessive childhood hearing loss) and the impact of the gene on patient outcome (e.g. blindness developed due to Usher Syndrome), an initial set of genes were selected for inclusion on one or both hearing loss arrays (e.g. GJB2, GJB6, CDH23, KCNE1, KCNQ1, MYO7A, OTOF, USH1C, and TMPRSS3). Due to space limitations only the most conserved portion of CDH23 was tiled. Most other genes had extremely limited data on relative contribution and therefore several genes were selected based upon other minor characteristics (e.g. contribution to both dominant and recessive hearing loss (e.g. MYO6), interest in discovering a larger undocumented role in hearing loss (e.g. SLC26A5) and/or small gene size to fill remaining capacity on array (e.g. TMIE). It should be noted that current studies suggest that SLC26A5 mutations may not be a cause of hearing loss [34] . Details of the sequences included are in the Methods and Additional file 1.",
          "Two arrays were designed, one at University of Cincinnati/Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH) and one at Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA) with 8 genes on each array representing a total of 13 unique genes assessed. The Cincinnati array contained: GJB2, GJB6, CDH23 (59 out of 69 exons; 80.3% of the coding sequence), KCNE1, KCNQ1, MYO7A, OTOF, and SLC26A4 genes and the Harvard array contained: GJB2, MYO6, MYO7A, OTOF, SLC26A5, TMIE, TMPRSS3, and USH1C genes. For all genes, both the coding sequence and splice junctions were assessed. For the Cincinnati array, 2 bp of each flanking splice site were tiled for most exons. For the Harvard array, 10 bp of each flanking splice site were tiled for all exons. Additional file 1 contains an overview of the genes tiled on the arrays. Each array contained probes to interrogate roughly 26,000 bases of DNA (8 probes representing all 4 bases to assess the forward strand and all 4 bases to assess the reverse strand). In addition, probes designed to detect 17 previously reported insertions and deletions were also tiled on the Harvard array (Additional file 1).",
          "Initially the arrays were run according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, long range PCR conditions for the LA TaKaRa Polymerase (Takara, Japan) were: TaKaRa LA Taq 0.05 U/ul, 1× LA PCR Buffer II, 400 uM (each) dNTPs, 0.3 uM (each) primers, 4 ng/ul genomic DNA in a 25 ul reaction volume. Short range PCR conditions are described below for dideoxy sequencing. Cycling conditions for most reactions were 94°C 2 min, (94°C 15 sec, 68°C 9 min) × 30, 68°C 14 min, 4°C. Modifications using standard approaches to PCR optimization were made for some difficult reactions. All PCR assays were either quantified using PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or absorbance spectrometry and then pooled in equimolar amounts. The PCR products were then purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to the array. Finally, the arrays were washed and scanned and the data were analyzed using the GeneChip DNA Analysis Software (GDAS 2.0, Affymetrix) or the GeneChip Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ 4.0, Affymetrix). After initial experience, the Cincinnati protocol was modified to include only short range PCR in order to increase PCR and fragmentation consistency and facilitate the use of automation. In addition, PCR products were cleaned robotically using magnetic beads, 7.5× less fragmentation reagent was used than suggested (0.02 U vs the recommended 0.15 U) and fragmentation products were analyzed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA).",
          "Complete dideoxy sequencing of all exons was performed for 14 of the Harvard patient arrays and all of the 25 Cincinnati arrays (enabling assessment of false negative rates) and partial sequencing was performed for the remaining 35 patients in order to confirm or clarify bases assigned as variants or \"no calls\" by Affymetrix GDAS or GSEQ software. ",
          "Affymetrix GDAS 2.0 with optimized settings (Additional file 1) was used for assignment of base calls for Harvard arrays and GSEQ 4.0 was used for Cincinnati arrays. The algorithm settings were determined after evaluating different quality score thresholds and comparing array calls with dideoxy sequencing results to characterize coverage and accuracy. The settings chosen were optimized for the highest call rate without increasing the false negative rate. We also developed a novel algorithm (sPROFILER) for strand-specific probe cell intensity comparison for filtering GDAS/GSEQ base calls. The algorithm was developed to re-examine GDAS/GSEQ output to reduce no-calls and, in some cases, false positives. sPROFILER attempts to resolve no-calls based on intensity signature from a single strand when a base cannot be called due to poor hybridization on one of the strands. The algorithm uses all wild-type bases within the array to determine threshold for peak to next highest intensity ratio on either strand and uses the base call at the position of interest across all arrays to determine the proportion of wild-type calls that are made on that position by GSEQ. The latter is used for scaling the threshold ratio and thus, in effect, making the algorithm more conservative while attempting to assign a wild-type call to a position that is being called variant in a large number of samples and vice-versa. We also adopted two additional bioinformatics filters developed for the Francisella tularensis whole-genome resequencing platform [17] . The filters were designed for reduction in false positives by screening variant calls that 1) are in regions rich in variant calls and no-calls, and 2) have low quality scores for the corresponding base call. With the exception of wild-type calls within no-call stretches, sPROFILER does not attempt to re-examine any base calls conforming to the reference sequence because GDAS and GSEQ are conservative in making wild-type calls and thus achieve low false negative rates. The output calls were compared against sequencing results and against GDAS/GSEQ calls for validation. sPROFILER was implemented in MATLAB. A detailed description of sPROFILER and accompanying MATLAB code are provided in Additional files 1 &2.",

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",
          "Development/adaptation of facility plans should include administrative and critical care stakeholders, review and vetting with other affected department staff [Accident Facilities should establish temporary anteroom/changing area off hallway (2 h).

Using the standard surge capacity worksheet as a tool, determine with incident management which patient care areas to use as infectious patient cohort care depending on the current and anticipated event scope. Cohort areas to may expand and contract during the course of the event 2. Facilities should assist with construction of temporary anterooms for PPE changing adjacent to each cohort area and assure exhaust ventilation for these areas. Supply may not be able to be manipulated for large areas 3. Hospital should implement access control and staff screening/monitoring plans 4. PPE used by staff continuously in infectious/cohort area, potentially hospital-wide depending on scope of the event and transmissibility",
          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

Serological surveys have reported point prevalences ranging of up to 50.8% among domestic pigs [17] while a molecular study on pig lymph nodes from an abattoir detected three cases out of the 35 sampled (8.6%) [6] . However, there is no report on occurrence of PCV2 infections and Porcine Circovirus associated diseases (PCVADs) on pig farms in Central Uganda. Given the limited reports on PCVADs in Uganda, it remains unclear if animal health workers (AHWs) and farmers are aware of the occurrence of PCV2 infections. This study was therefore aimed at detecting PCV2-SD on commercial pig farms and assessment of stakeholders' associated knowledge in Central Uganda.",

Negative and positive controls from the University of Giessen, Germany were also processed alongside the samples to validate the findings.",
          "Amplification of target DNA was done using QIAGEN HotStar HiFidelity PCR Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 µL of sample DNA template was added to 10 PCR conditions included initial activation step of heating at 94°C for 5 mins, denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C and the cycle from denaturation to extension was repeated for 40 cycles, then final extension at 72°C for 5 min and end of PCR cycling at 4°C. 5 µL of the amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis (120v for 1 h) on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide and photographs taken.",
          "Data obtained during the field survey were entered in Microsoft Excel sheets (Microsoft 2007) before exportation to SPSS 11.5 program for statistical analysis. Summarized data were presented in tables as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test and binomial test were used to establish the significance of differences between proportions and P values of < .05 were considered significant. For histopathology, IHC and PCR, the findings were described and documented by microphotography. Results of laboratory findings were also summarized as percentages. Qualitative data from the FGDs and key informant interviews were summarized according to themes and presented as summary statements with some sample quotations presented in the results.",
          "In total, 131 pig farms were sampled for the study. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents.",
          "All the farmers interviewed in this study reported death of weaned piglets in the past six months. Majority of the farmers (57.3%; P = .058) had ever observed emaciation among weaned piglets before death. The farmers reported emaciated piglets practiced semi intensive (n = 11) and intensive management systems (n = 64), P = .27. Diarrhea refractory to treatments was reported among few pig farms (n = 37; P < .0001). Tables 2 and 3 highlight the husbandry practices and extent of occurrence of PCV2-SD-like clinical signs on the study farms, respectively. None of the farmers screened pigs for major infectious diseases before introduction into their farms.",
          "All the farmers or their representatives (n = 131; 100%) had never heard of PCV2-SD as a disease of pigs. Neither use of any vaccine against PCV2-SD nor diagnosis of PCV2-SD was reported among the pigs on any of the farms visited. In the three focus group discussions (FGDs), although all the respondents reported ever seeing weaned piglets getting emaciated, none knew about PCV2-SD and as such, there were no local names for the disease. In one of the FGDs, one participant (male, Wakiso) reported: \"I have never heard about such a disease\". \"[……] not even the doctors who treat my pigs have ever told me that my pigs are suffering from the disease you mentioned\". Generally, farmers attributed the emaciation of pigs to poor nutrition, helminthiasis or other long standing diseases. When the implicating clinical picture was presented to the farmers, farmers reported the occurrence of such morbidity among grower pigs but no technical personnel had ever talked to them about the disease. One of the farmers (male) with over 600 pigs in Wakiso said, 'When you find any positive result, you let us know such that we improve our management'. Antibiotic therapy especially sulphonamides administration (S-Dime®, Norodine®) and deworming were the common treatments administered to the affected piglets. Regular deworming and proper feeding were reported as the main control practices for progressive weight loss.",
          "The actual records of pig farmers in the districts visited were not available although veterinarians had personal contacts with farmers and had some information on approximate number of farmers in their respective areas of operation. Of the 12 veterinarians interviewed only 2 (all from the university) had ever heard about PCV2-SD. However, all the field practitioners reported seeing progressive loss of weight in weaned piglets. Such morbidities were attributed to weaning stress, helminthiasis, poor nutrition and other enteropathies such as corona virus and rotavirus infections. Two veterinarians in Wakiso reported experiencing progressive weight loss coupled with intermittent diarrhea which was refractory to prolonged antibacterial therapy (S-Dime®, Enrosol®, Oxytetracycline, Norodine®) and disinfectants in water. The drug sellers reported selling anti-diarrheals and antibiotics to pig farmers to manage chronic diarrhoea. The drug dealers attributed the increased use of antibiotic among pig farmers to outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) and various bacterial diseases. No drug company reported importation of vaccines specifically for pigs. Moreover, dispensing personnel did not know that the commercial vaccines for PCV2 were available.",
          "Among the 131 farms sampled, twenty chronically emaciated piglets were detected. Of these; twelve (60%) were from Wakiso, Five (25%) from Mukono, two (10%) from Mpigi and one (5%) from Kampala. All the affected pigs were on intensive management with over 100 pigs in a herd. Weaning of piglets on these farms was done between 5 and 6 weeks of age and all farms were mixing different litters. On the respective farms, there were reports of piglets that had clinical signs of chronic wasting (Fig. 2a) soon after weaning with intermittent diarrhoea. One farm from Wakiso also reported reproductive problems ranging from increased number of stillbirths of different sizes to unthrifty piglets born with tremors. The same farm also reported incidences of skin lesions that appeared as necrotic patches on ventral abdomen and flanks among weaners and fatteners. On this particular farm, none of the cases was thoroughly investigated but two of the sampled piglets were positive to PCV2 on PCR and IHC. Other than cachexia and persistent diarrhea, these two moribund piglets also presented with breathing difficulties and they were reportedly non responsive to treatment with Enrosol® (Enrofloxacin 10%).",
          "From the twenty piglets with cachexia from farms, 8 had enlarged inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2b) , all of which had necrotic cut surfaces. Six piglets were found to have ulcerative gastroenteritis and these had persistent diarrhoea. Moribund cases (n = 11) had an average of 10 9 cfu/g of β-haemolytic E. coli colonies in the duodenal contents. In all these cases, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) was identified by demonstrating fimbriae antigens K88, K99 987P and F41. Five of these cases were positive on PCR and Immunohistochemistry for PCV2 infections. Some pigs (n = 15) also had non-collapsing lungs which appeared grayish and pneumonic. Multiple abscesses were detected in lungs, lymph nodes and abdominal viscera in the piglets with lymphadenopathy.",
          "Histologically, the diseased pigs which presented with enlarged lymph nodes (n = 8) had lymphoid necrosis or severe lymphoid depletion with total loss of follicular architecture (Fig. 3 ) coupled with extensive histiocytic and macrophages infiltrations. The intestinal villi were shortened and in some cases bacteria were attached to the mucosal surfaces (n = 6) (Fig. 4) . Granulomatous inflammation with large numbers of macrophages and giant cells were visible in the lungs of two pigs from Wakiso (Fig. 5) . ",
          "A total of five samples from emaciated pigs on farms were found to be positive for PCV2 (Fig. 6) , three of which were from the same farm. The other two cases came from two other different farms and all positive cases came from Wakiso district (Fig. 6 ).",
          "The positive lymph node samples (5 in number) to PCV2 on PCR and those with highly suspicious on H&E were processed using immunohistochemical techniques. In total, lymph nodes from 5 animals were positive to PCV2 antigens on IHC and these were the same positive animals on PCR analysis. Positive result was shown by brown deposits of the substrate chromogen in the affected cells (Fig. 7) .",
          "PCV2-SD is a recently characterized disease of pigs [1] . The confirmation of PCV2 infections is by demonstration of viral antigens or DNA through IHC or in situ hybridisation [21, 22] and PCR [23] . These two diagnostic techniques require well established laboratory facilities and trained personnel. Since Uganda currently lacks these facilities at district level; confirmatory diagnosis, surveillance and subsequent information dissemination to pig farmers (mainly small holders) may not be possible. This may partly explain the limited level of awareness of animal health practitioners and the farmers.",
          "Lack of appropriate information on PCV2 infections and associated diseases is likely to contribute to the propagation of these infections. Also, appropriate management aimed at minimizing the risk factors, may be overlooked by farmers. For example, 99.2% (P < .001) of the farmers mixed weaned piglets from different sows thus age groups and different sources. Also, early weaning (below five weeks) was being practiced by over 30% of the farmers. The later contributes to early withdrawal of maternal antibodies before development of the immune system. The risk of occurrence and aggravation of morbidity due to PCV2 infections is known to be compounded by the above factors [1, [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, most pig farms in Uganda hardly implement proper bio-security measures [17] . Although effective commercial vaccines against PCV2 infections have been developed [27, 28] , their use to control PCVADs has never been explored in Uganda. Occurrence of PCV2 infections on some farms as revealed by this study indicates failure to control triggers for onset of PCV2-SD which presents a big risk for occurrence of epidemic outbreaks.",
          "PCV2 infections are immunosuppressive and frequently occur with persistent secondary bacterial infections. Limited knowledge of pig farmers and field animal health workers (AHWs) on the existence of PCV2-SD presents clinical diagnostic errors which may inadvertently contribute to unwarranted use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents targeting diseases with similar manifestations. Indeed, 87% of the farmers reported persistent diarrhea in this study continued treating refractory cases when the pigs did not improve after the first treatment regimen. Such practices may result in contamination of pork and pork products with antibiotic and other drug residues.",
          "Immunosuppression, a major feature of infected pigs, may also contribute to pig products contamination with food borne pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica [14] . Also, persistent use of antibiotics among pigs with PCV2-SD may contribute to the emergence of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria. The above health hazards may discourage consumers from the consumption of pig products. This may retard the growth of the pig industry, one of the most rapidly growing animal enterprises in Uganda [18] .",
          "Only five (25%) of the 20 chronically wasted pigs were positive for PCV2. This emphasizes the importance of confirmatory diagnosis in disease management. Prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin may affect the sensitivity of IHC and PCR. In this study, samples were processed within two weeks to minimize the effects of prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin. Despite the confirmation of PCV2 infections from one district (Wakiso), the extent of the problem may be widespread since there is a limited control in the movement of breeding stock amidst poor diagnosis, subclinical states and limited knowledge. Actually, the study sampled only pigs presenting with chronic diarrhea for laboratory detection of PCV2 in tissues hence subclinical infections which are highly prevalent in other regions of Uganda [6, 17] were not investigated. Chronic wasting among pigs that were negative for PCV2 could not be fully characterized as their causes were not investigated. Such may include malnutrition and viral enteropathies such as rotavirus, parvovirus and corona virus infections among others. Future studies are recommended to investigate the extent of PCVADs and other enteropathies and their contribution to the onset of PCV2-SD.",
          "This study demonstrated the occurrence of PCV2 infections associated with chronic wasting and persistent diarrhea in pigs on farms in Central Uganda and low levels of knowledge on PCV2-SD among farmers and AHWs. It is therefore imperative to sensitize farmers and veterinary practitioners about the existence of PCV2 infections and PCVADs with their possible effects on the Ugandan pig industry, public health and pig welfare. Further studies on the prevalence and mapping of PCV2 infections and PCVADs are required to establish the extent of the infection to guide interventions. Vaccination against PCVADs should also be encouraged to control the disease on pig farms."

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",

Supply may not be able to be manipulated for large areas 3. Hospital should implement access control and staff screening/monitoring plans 4.

          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

        "Our independent analysis of COVID-19 cases per million of inhabitant in 78 countries that were stratified based on the prevalence of BCG vaccination (universal vaccination policy) shows that, a priori, there is a correlation between current universal BCG vaccination policy and a lower incidence of CoV-2 infection and related deaths.",
        "However, we note that testing rates (tests per million inhabitants) was positively correlated with incidence of CoV-2 infection.",
        "Taking in consideration this important bias, we curated the data to compare the number cases amongst countries with distinct universal BCG policy based on high CoV-2 testing rates, as defined by 2,500 tests or more per million inhabitants.",
        "The results show a lack of significant difference in incidence of COVID-19 cases in countries with current universal BCG vaccination policy and countries with never-or in the past-universal BCG vaccination policy.",

        "This may however reflect potential inaccuracies in reporting of COVID-19 mortalities due to lack of Cov-2 testing.",
        "Our study is limited by several critical considerations, which were not addressed here.",
        "These include the variability and inaccuracies in reporting positive cases and reporting specific mortality associated with CoV-2 infection, lack of reporting on asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases, the impact of social and economic barriers in accessing care, the association with other co-morbidities, and the adherence or access to vaccination as per policy.",
        "In this regard, a recent report showed a correlation of universal BCG vaccination policies and the number of COVID-19 cases when controlling for income [7] .",

          "Newly identified SARS CoV-2 may cause mild and self-limiting illness with upper respiratory tract symptoms, non-life-threatening pneumonia and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that begin with mild symptoms and then progresses rapidly to respiratory failure requiring intensive care management (1-2-3 -4) . This latter occurrence affects above all older people or those with comorbidities, i.e. diabetes, arterial hypertension, pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions (1) . The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been classified by the World Health Organization as a global pandemic. On January 31st, after the detection in Rome of two COVID-19 positive Chinese tourists travelling from Wuhan, the Italian Cabinet declared a 6-month national emergency and formally entrusted the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak emergency plan to the head of the Civil Protection Department. On February 22nd, the first Italian COVID-19 positive patient was reported by the health authorities in Lombardy, followed by a number of additional cases in the neighbouring areas of Emilia Romagna and Veneto. On February 23rd, the first \"red zones\" were created near the hotspots. The clusters emerging in the Northern part of the country revealed a wide community spread of the virus; hence, additional restrictive measures were raised in the entire Lombardy and Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Liguria, and Piemonte regions in subsequent days. Schools and universities were officially closed nationwide on March 4th. A partial lockdown was introduced in the whole country on March 9th, followed by a complete lockdown on March 22nd when all non-essential activities were shut down. Further restrictions of movements were introduced on March 25th. Up to April 24, 2020 in Italy, the most affected European country, there had been 192.994 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 25.969 deaths (5) .",
          "Italian hospitals, particularly from Lombardy, Veneto and Piemonte, have dramatically reshaped their structure and capacity to adapt to the increased number of patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting to the Emergency Room (ER) requiring advanced life support and ICU admittance (3, 4) . Separated triage programs in the ER to avoid contact between positive and negative patients have been implemented, self-presentation to the ER has been discouraged and lastly dedicated COVID-19 wards, often managed by multidisciplinary teams of specialists, have been introduced (6) . Outpatients clinics have been remodelled to follow recommendations by experts and scientific societies for patients with coexisting chronic diseases. These recommendations are mostly based on the implementation of telemedicine services and telephone triage systems with the postponement of nonurgent ambulatory visits (7) . Italy was the first European country hit by COVID-19, with the highest number of deaths in the world, so far. It has also been the first country, outside of China, to impose strict lockdown measures. In the early phase of the emergency slow compliance with public health measures and a flux of people travelling out of the most hard-hit regions towards the South (after the ministerial decree was prematurely leaked to the press), may potentially have had a negative impact on the spread of the outbreak in previously unaffected areas. In the urgency of addressing COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting (with the doubling of ICU beds in the span of 15 days), Italy might have been slow in organizing an equally effective response at the primary/community level. The high level of infected General Practioners (as compared to all healthcare professionals) testifies the lower level of attention that this part of the healthcare workforce has received in the overall COVID-19 emergency response strategy. According to the April 25th update, the curve of COVID-19 inpatients (especially those requiring ICU) is decreasing, and the growth rate of total cases is slowing down. However the risk of relapse is concrete.",
          "Data on infections and mortality linked to COVID-19 are dramatic and initially seemed to indicate an \"Italian case\" or even more to a \"Lombardy case\" (the most populated and rich region in Italy with 10 million inhabitants and a high population density). Now, what happened between the end of February and March 2020 in Italy, and in particular in Lombardy, was a real \"health hurricane\" that has caused a violent disturbance of the health system with an intense health demand, huge need for hospitalizations, a real assault on the only places in care, hospitals.",
          "However, other European countries also recorded high mortality expressed as deaths/100.000 inhabitants) such as Belgium 58.47, Spain 48.20, Italy 42.97, France 33.20, UK 29.33, Netherland 24.89 and Sweden 21.13 (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/cases-2019-ncov-eueea). Always, in routinary health care, when a dramatic and unexpected event happens, we proceed to start an \"Audit\" defined as \"a review of the professional standards of doctors, usually within a hospital, conducted by a medical committee to verify health interventions, timing, setting and professionals involved. The aim is retrospectively to understand whether the clinical recommendations (what) operational procedures (how), the professionals involved (who), the timing (when) and the setting (where) of care have been corrected.",
          "All of us Europeans made mistakes thinking that what was happening in China would never affect us because that was an \"Asian problem\" confined to that strange country that in two weeks built mega hospitals and locked itself in the house. Moreover, the WHO has underestimated first and gave contradictory indications then, the Italian (and European) politicians have attempted to procrastinate as much as possible the hard and dramatic action of lock down.",
          "Proper scientific audit will not fail to take seriously into account the different health systems, the rapid ability to identify a sick or healthy carrier, the under-financing of health systems, the number of available places in intensive care, the different enhancements and capabilities of territorial medicine, the decentralization of health services, the ability of the territory to cope with a treacherous pathology that in a few hours can lead to respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. A serious audit will also have to take into account the inability to test the virus with a swab in millions of people, the huge territorial and economic differences, the population density, the different factories zones, the international trade relations, the presence of railway, motorway or airport interconnections, the orographic factors and finally cultural and socio-demographic differences that all together can facilitate or make complex effective isolation.",
          "However, an important aspect of the Lombardy situation is if the excessive rate of hospitalizations ended up worsening the clinical outcome; in the areas of high endemia, about 20% of the patients who arrived to the emergency room did not survive, over 50% needed even aggressive ventilator support and only 20-30% were perhaps manageable at home, albeit with pneumonia. It was therefore very difficult to manage all cases at home, considering also the difficulty to evaluate the clinical evolution, almost always unpredictable.",
          "Understanding, analyzing and contextualizing in the dramatic time we have experienced, would allow us to avoid future mistakes by organizing new health paths: this is a slow, tiring and methodical process that requires observation, data collection, measurement, description, analysis and evaluation. The call to the entire scientific community is to contribute with their experiences and ability to overcome this moment: the challenge is to further improve the health system but giving back to the medical and scientific class the lost role in pre-Covid-19 society."

Furthermore, repeated inadvertent use of antibiotics in PCV2-SD cases contributes to antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic residues in pork and pork products.",
          "Studies on the occurrence of PCV2 infections are very limited in Africa [16] . The occurrence of PCV2 infections was recently reported in Uganda [6, 17] . Serological surveys have reported point prevalences ranging of up to 50.8% among domestic pigs [17] while a molecular study on pig lymph nodes from an abattoir detected three cases out of the 35 sampled (8.6%) [6] . However, there is no report on occurrence of PCV2 infections and Porcine Circovirus associated diseases (PCVADs) on pig farms in Central Uganda. Given the limited reports on PCVADs in Uganda, it remains unclear if animal health workers (AHWs) and farmers are aware of the occurrence of PCV2 infections. This study was therefore aimed at detecting PCV2-SD on commercial pig farms and assessment of stakeholders' associated knowledge in Central Uganda.",
          "The study was approved by the higher degrees committee of the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Resources, Makerere University (HD/Min/3.1/11/AUG/2011). Written informed consent was obtained from farm owners and key informants to participate in the study.",

Only pig farms which contacted the ambulatory clinic of the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Resources, Makerere University for veterinary services and those identified through district animal health workers (AHWs) were included in the study. Key informants included area AHWs and veterinary drug sellers. Only piglets that looked unthrifty and had a history of refractory diarrhea (unresponsive to antibiotic therapy) and dyspnoea were selected from study farms for detailed laboratory investigations.",

In-depth interviews were conducted using interview guides to establish key informants' (n = 12) knowledge and awareness on PCV2-SD. Key informants included actively practicing veterinarians from the study districts (n = 6), clinicians from the Veterinary School, Makerere University (n = 2) and veterinary practitioners working in major veterinary drug outlets in each of the study districts (n = 4). Three FGDs were conducted in each of the districts of Mpigi, Mukono and Wakiso to validate data collected using questionnaires and get an in depth insight into the level of pig farmers knowledge on PCV2-SD. The FGDs were constituted by 9 to 12 farmers each (total of 31 participants) and lasted up to 50 min. The discussions focused on: knowledge/ awareness about PCV2-SD and treatment/prevention of chronic diarrhea. Proceedings were documented in writing by two independent repertoires.",

Necropsies were performed on the sampled piglets using a standard autopsy technique as described by King et al. [19] . The organ samples (lungs, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, tonsils, intestines, liver and heart) were taken for further laboratory analysis. During autopsy, gross lesions were described. Tissue samples were immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin and then submitted to Central Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL), Makerere University for histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC) and polymerase chain ",
          "After fixation (maximum of 14 days), approximately 5 mm thick tissue sections were cut for processing in an automated histokinete (SLEE, Germany) into paraffin blocks. Tissue processing was done in accordance with standard histopathology procedures described by Edna et al. [20] . After processing, tissues were then embedded in molten paraffin using individual base moulds attached to plastic cassettes before cooling on a cold surface. The excess paraffin was trimmed off before sections of 5 µM thickness were cut with a microtome for Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and IHC staining using standard methods (Mayer's H&E and PAP for IHC, respectively) [20] .",
          "Paired sections were made and stained as described in the IHC protocol provided by the manufacturer (DAKO, Tokyo, Japan). Tissue sections for IHC (spleen, intestines and lymph nodes) were held on silanised slides (DAKO, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, the tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and decreasing concentrations of ethanol before washing in distilled water and Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by immersion of the deparaffinized tissues in 3% hydrogen peroxide mixed with 0.5% methanol for 30 min before rising with distilled water and PBS. For antigen retrieval, slides were incubated in freshly prepared trypsin (0.25%) at 37°C for 10 min and then washing with PBS for three times each five minutes. The sections were then incubated at 4°C in PCV2 specific primary antibody (Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain) overnight before rinsing in PBS. This was followed by incubation at room temperature in a secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse IgG) conjugated to Horseradish peroxidase enzyme labeled polymer (Sigma, Aldrich, Germany). Development was effected with DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride) and hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 3 min before rinsing with PBS followed by distilled water. Mayer's Hematoxylin was used as a counterstaining for 3 min. Eventually the sections were dehydrated in graded alcohol (70%X2 for 3 min each, 100%X2 for 20 min each), cleared with xylene for 20 min before mounting with DPX.",
          "The processed slides were viewed under a light microscope at various magnifications and findings were described. Major findings were also documented by microphotography. Examination of H&E slides was for identification of established PCV2 infection implicating lesions while IHC was used for localization of antigens in tissues positive on PCR or those with PCV2-like lesions identified by H&E technique. Tissue samples of known PCV2 status (negative and positive controls; gracefully provided by Prof. Dr. Manfred Reinacher, University of Giessen, Germany) were processed alongside the samples to validate the results.",
          "For PCR, 10 sections (only spleen and lymph nodes) of 10 µm thick for each pig were cut and placed in 1.5 mL eppendorf® tubes containing 1 mL of xylene for deparaffinization. In between samples, microtome blades were cleaned with xylene to prevent cross contamination of samples. Extraction of DNA was done using QIAamp® DNA Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) Tissue Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, D-40724 Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Negative and positive controls from the University of Giessen, Germany were also processed alongside the samples to validate the findings.",
          "Amplification of target DNA was done using QIAGEN HotStar HiFidelity PCR Kit as per the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 µL of sample DNA template was added to 10 PCR conditions included initial activation step of heating at 94°C for 5 mins, denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, extension at 72°C and the cycle from denaturation to extension was repeated for 40 cycles, then final extension at 72°C for 5 min and end of PCR cycling at 4°C. 5 µL of the amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis (120v for 1 h) on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide and photographs taken.",
          "Data obtained during the field survey were entered in Microsoft Excel sheets (Microsoft 2007) before exportation to SPSS 11.5 program for statistical analysis. Summarized data were presented in tables as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test and binomial test were used to establish the significance of differences between proportions and P values of < .05 were considered significant. For histopathology, IHC and PCR, the findings were described and documented by microphotography. Results of laboratory findings were also summarized as percentages. Qualitative data from the FGDs and key informant interviews were summarized according to themes and presented as summary statements with some sample quotations presented in the results.",
          "In total, 131 pig farms were sampled for the study. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents.",
          "All the farmers interviewed in this study reported death of weaned piglets in the past six months. Majority of the farmers (57.3%; P = .058) had ever observed emaciation among weaned piglets before death. The farmers reported emaciated piglets practiced semi intensive (n = 11) and intensive management systems (n = 64), P = .27. Diarrhea refractory to treatments was reported among few pig farms (n = 37; P < .0001). Tables 2 and 3 highlight the husbandry practices and extent of occurrence of PCV2-SD-like clinical signs on the study farms, respectively. None of the farmers screened pigs for major infectious diseases before introduction into their farms.",
          "All the farmers or their representatives (n = 131; 100%) had never heard of PCV2-SD as a disease of pigs. Neither use of any vaccine against PCV2-SD nor diagnosis of PCV2-SD was reported among the pigs on any of the farms visited. In the three focus group discussions (FGDs), although all the respondents reported ever seeing weaned piglets getting emaciated, none knew about PCV2-SD and as such, there were no local names for the disease. In one of the FGDs, one participant (male, Wakiso) reported: \"I have never heard about such a disease\". \"[……] not even the doctors who treat my pigs have ever told me that my pigs are suffering from the disease you mentioned\". Generally, farmers attributed the emaciation of pigs to poor nutrition, helminthiasis or other long standing diseases. When the implicating clinical picture was presented to the farmers, farmers reported the occurrence of such morbidity among grower pigs but no technical personnel had ever talked to them about the disease. One of the farmers (male) with over 600 pigs in Wakiso said, 'When you find any positive result, you let us know such that we improve our management'. Antibiotic therapy especially sulphonamides administration (S-Dime®, Norodine®) and deworming were the common treatments administered to the affected piglets. Regular deworming and proper feeding were reported as the main control practices for progressive weight loss.",
          "The actual records of pig farmers in the districts visited were not available although veterinarians had personal contacts with farmers and had some information on approximate number of farmers in their respective areas of operation. Of the 12 veterinarians interviewed only 2 (all from the university) had ever heard about PCV2-SD. However, all the field practitioners reported seeing progressive loss of weight in weaned piglets. Such morbidities were attributed to weaning stress, helminthiasis, poor nutrition and other enteropathies such as corona virus and rotavirus infections. Two veterinarians in Wakiso reported experiencing progressive weight loss coupled with intermittent diarrhea which was refractory to prolonged antibacterial therapy (S-Dime®, Enrosol®, Oxytetracycline, Norodine®) and disinfectants in water. The drug sellers reported selling anti-diarrheals and antibiotics to pig farmers to manage chronic diarrhoea. The drug dealers attributed the increased use of antibiotic among pig farmers to outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) and various bacterial diseases. No drug company reported importation of vaccines specifically for pigs. Moreover, dispensing personnel did not know that the commercial vaccines for PCV2 were available.",
          "Among the 131 farms sampled, twenty chronically emaciated piglets were detected. Of these; twelve (60%) were from Wakiso, Five (25%) from Mukono, two (10%) from Mpigi and one (5%) from Kampala. All the affected pigs were on intensive management with over 100 pigs in a herd. Weaning of piglets on these farms was done between 5 and 6 weeks of age and all farms were mixing different litters. On the respective farms, there were reports of piglets that had clinical signs of chronic wasting (Fig. 2a) soon after weaning with intermittent diarrhoea. One farm from Wakiso also reported reproductive problems ranging from increased number of stillbirths of different sizes to unthrifty piglets born with tremors. The same farm also reported incidences of skin lesions that appeared as necrotic patches on ventral abdomen and flanks among weaners and fatteners. On this particular farm, none of the cases was thoroughly investigated but two of the sampled piglets were positive to PCV2 on PCR and IHC. Other than cachexia and persistent diarrhea, these two moribund piglets also presented with breathing difficulties and they were reportedly non responsive to treatment with Enrosol® (Enrofloxacin 10%).",
          "From the twenty piglets with cachexia from farms, 8 had enlarged inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2b) , all of which had necrotic cut surfaces. Six piglets were found to have ulcerative gastroenteritis and these had persistent diarrhoea. Moribund cases (n = 11) had an average of 10 9 cfu/g of β-haemolytic E. coli colonies in the duodenal contents. In all these cases, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) was identified by demonstrating fimbriae antigens K88, K99 987P and F41. Five of these cases were positive on PCR and Immunohistochemistry for PCV2 infections. Some pigs (n = 15) also had non-collapsing lungs which appeared grayish and pneumonic. Multiple abscesses were detected in lungs, lymph nodes and abdominal viscera in the piglets with lymphadenopathy.",
          "Histologically, the diseased pigs which presented with enlarged lymph nodes (n = 8) had lymphoid necrosis or severe lymphoid depletion with total loss of follicular architecture (Fig. 3 ) coupled with extensive histiocytic and macrophages infiltrations. The intestinal villi were shortened and in some cases bacteria were attached to the mucosal surfaces (n = 6) (Fig. 4) . Granulomatous inflammation with large numbers of macrophages and giant cells were visible in the lungs of two pigs from Wakiso (Fig. 5) . ",
          "A total of five samples from emaciated pigs on farms were found to be positive for PCV2 (Fig. 6) , three of which were from the same farm. The other two cases came from two other different farms and all positive cases came from Wakiso district (Fig. 6 ).",
          "The positive lymph node samples (5 in number) to PCV2 on PCR and those with highly suspicious on H&E were processed using immunohistochemical techniques. In total, lymph nodes from 5 animals were positive to PCV2 antigens on IHC and these were the same positive animals on PCR analysis. Positive result was shown by brown deposits of the substrate chromogen in the affected cells (Fig. 7) .",
          "PCV2-SD is a recently characterized disease of pigs [1] . The confirmation of PCV2 infections is by demonstration of viral antigens or DNA through IHC or in situ hybridisation [21, 22] and PCR [23] . These two diagnostic techniques require well established laboratory facilities and trained personnel. Since Uganda currently lacks these facilities at district level; confirmatory diagnosis, surveillance and subsequent information dissemination to pig farmers (mainly small holders) may not be possible. This may partly explain the limited level of awareness of animal health practitioners and the farmers.",
          "Lack of appropriate information on PCV2 infections and associated diseases is likely to contribute to the propagation of these infections. Also, appropriate management aimed at minimizing the risk factors, may be overlooked by farmers. For example, 99.2% (P < .001) of the farmers mixed weaned piglets from different sows thus age groups and different sources. Also, early weaning (below five weeks) was being practiced by over 30% of the farmers. The later contributes to early withdrawal of maternal antibodies before development of the immune system. The risk of occurrence and aggravation of morbidity due to PCV2 infections is known to be compounded by the above factors [1, [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, most pig farms in Uganda hardly implement proper bio-security measures [17] . Although effective commercial vaccines against PCV2 infections have been developed [27, 28] , their use to control PCVADs has never been explored in Uganda. Occurrence of PCV2 infections on some farms as revealed by this study indicates failure to control triggers for onset of PCV2-SD which presents a big risk for occurrence of epidemic outbreaks.",
          "PCV2 infections are immunosuppressive and frequently occur with persistent secondary bacterial infections. Limited knowledge of pig farmers and field animal health workers (AHWs) on the existence of PCV2-SD presents clinical diagnostic errors which may inadvertently contribute to unwarranted use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents targeting diseases with similar manifestations. Indeed, 87% of the farmers reported persistent diarrhea in this study continued treating refractory cases when the pigs did not improve after the first treatment regimen. Such practices may result in contamination of pork and pork products with antibiotic and other drug residues.",
          "Immunosuppression, a major feature of infected pigs, may also contribute to pig products contamination with food borne pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica [14] . Also, persistent use of antibiotics among pigs with PCV2-SD may contribute to the emergence of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria. The above health hazards may discourage consumers from the consumption of pig products. This may retard the growth of the pig industry, one of the most rapidly growing animal enterprises in Uganda [18] .",
          "Only five (25%) of the 20 chronically wasted pigs were positive for PCV2. This emphasizes the importance of confirmatory diagnosis in disease management. Prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin may affect the sensitivity of IHC and PCR. In this study, samples were processed within two weeks to minimize the effects of prolonged fixation of tissues in formalin. Despite the confirmation of PCV2 infections from one district (Wakiso), the extent of the problem may be widespread since there is a limited control in the movement of breeding stock amidst poor diagnosis, subclinical states and limited knowledge. Actually, the study sampled only pigs presenting with chronic diarrhea for laboratory detection of PCV2 in tissues hence subclinical infections which are highly prevalent in other regions of Uganda [6, 17] were not investigated. Chronic wasting among pigs that were negative for PCV2 could not be fully characterized as their causes were not investigated. Such may include malnutrition and viral enteropathies such as rotavirus, parvovirus and corona virus infections among others. Future studies are recommended to investigate the extent of PCVADs and other enteropathies and their contribution to the onset of PCV2-SD.",
          "This study demonstrated the occurrence of PCV2 infections associated with chronic wasting and persistent diarrhea in pigs on farms in Central Uganda and low levels of knowledge on PCV2-SD among farmers and AHWs. It is therefore imperative to sensitize farmers and veterinary practitioners about the existence of PCV2 infections and PCVADs with their possible effects on the Ugandan pig industry, public health and pig welfare. Further studies on the prevalence and mapping of PCV2 infections and PCVADs are required to establish the extent of the infection to guide interventions. Vaccination against PCVADs should also be encouraged to control the disease on pig farms."

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",
          "Development/adaptation of facility plans should include administrative and critical care stakeholders, review and vetting with other affected department staff [Accident Facilities should establish temporary anteroom/changing area off hallway (2 h).

Facilities should assist with construction of temporary anterooms for PPE changing adjacent to each cohort area and assure exhaust ventilation for these areas. Supply may not be able to be manipulated for large areas 3. Hospital should implement access control and staff screening/monitoring plans 4. PPE used by staff continuously in infectious/cohort area, potentially hospital-wide depending on scope of the event and transmissibility",
          "Sample core infectious disease critical care capacity elements for 'City Hospital.' Note that this plan reflects specific adaptations for the facility and that each facility should identify a phased approach to these patients. Space concerns are only one element of an overall infectious disease response plan and guidance for specific disease management, infection control, staff screening, behavioral health, visitor and access control policies, Emergency Department screening and cohorting, and patient transport planning (use of elevators, etc.) policies all should be included in the institutional plan City Hospital SOP for critical care management of a special pathogen: this guideline applies ONLY to pathogens that are transmitted by airborne or suspected airborne routes AND have a high likelihood of transmission and severe morbidity/mortality (may include SARS, pandemic influenza, some hemorrhagic fevers). These patients require careful and comprehensive use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff caregivers S18 & Emergency (A&E), operating room, stepdown units, and procedure areas, laboratory and radiology services, etc.], and preparedness activities supporting the SOP (materials acquisition, planning).",
          "The initial development of the critical care surge plan should include a draft, with discussion, revision and a feedback cycle to the facility stakeholders. Once a draft plan is complete, a tabletop exercise should test basic assumptions of the plan with revision as needed. Initial orientation and training of staff on procedures should follow, and the plans should then be tested as realistically as possible in a functional exercise. After each exercise or event, an after-action review should identify areas for improvement and corrective actions. The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",

          "Abstract Purpose: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for a mass disaster or influenza epidemic with a specific focus on surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Methods: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including surge capacity and infrastructure considerations. Results: Key recommendations include: (1) hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas; (2) hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas; hospitals should develop contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels to provide additional ventilators;",
          "(3) hospitals should develop a phased staffing plan (nursing and physician) for ICUs that provides sufficient patient care supervision during contingency and crisis situations; (4) hospitals should provide expert input to the emergency management personnel at the hospital both during planning for surge capacity as well as during response; (5) hospitals should assure that adequate infrastructure support is present to support critical care activities; (6) hospitals should prioritize locations for expansion by expanding existing ICUs, using postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then stepdown units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards. Conclusions: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for surge capacity and infrastructure considerations are necessary to optimize outcomes during a pandemic.",
          "The type of the mass casualty event (MCE) is a major determinant of the demands on a hospital. For 2009 H1N1 influenza, the impact on ICU services varied considerably. The proportion of ICU beds occupied by patients with H1N1 peaked at 9-19% in Australia and New Zealand [1] , but ICU services in Mexico were overwhelmed, and many patients required ventilation outside ICUs [2] .",
          "used for events of any scale and for both sudden (e.g., bomb detonation) or gradual events (e.g., pandemic influenza). 2. Scope: using examples and general recommendations, provide templates for intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation area expansion including consideration of central system capacity expansion (such as oxygen). Recent recommendations have called for institutions to prepare for at least a 300% increase in ICU capacity beyond baseline during a pandemic or catastrophic disaster [3] . This level of expansion of space and services is not achievable without significant prior planning/preparedness activities. Institutions should define their own capacities and capabilities. Defining specific limitations (e.g., shortage of available ventilators), sources to mitigate these shortfalls (e.g., national stockpile, institutional cache) and a strategy for accepting/using outside resources to expand capacity is critical to response success. This document cannot account for operational planning details at individual institutions, but aims to provide a brief, general overview of key issues to be addressed during events requiring critical care surge capacity generation. Hospitals should create their own specific plans according to hospital size, role in the community and the hazards recognized in the community. Hospitals may refer to recent articles for surge capacity frameworks [4, 5] and crisis patient care decision frameworks [6, 7] . 3. Goals and objectives: describe the basis for institutional standard operating procedures (SOP) for ICU and isolation space expansion using templates. Provide recommendations for expansion of oxygen capacity and continuity of infrastructure operation.",
          "1. Mass casualty event: an event generating a large number of victims that does not generate demand exceeding the facility or community resources. 2. Disaster: an event generating large numbers of victims that exceed usual hospital and/or community resources and requires changes in the usual practices to meet demand (usually short term). Usually implies temporary communications and resource shortfalls and a temporary lack of situational awareness. Note that a MCE is not equivalent to a disaster, and increased capacity and preparedness increase facility surge capacity for larger patient volumes before a MCE becomes a disaster. 3. Crisis standard of care: a substantial change in usual health care operations and the level of care it is possible to deliver, made necessary by a pervasive (e.g., pandemic influenza) or catastrophic (e.g., earthquake, hurricane) disaster. This change in the level of care delivered is justified by specific circumstances and is formally declared by government entities. The formal declaration that crisis standards of care are in operation enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for health care providers in the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources [7]. 4. Surge capacity: three functional components of surge capacity exist (Fig. 1 ) [5, 7] . a. Conventional: using usual patient care spaces, resources and practices. b. Contingency: using adapted areas of the facility for ICU services (procedure areas, post-anesthesia care, operative suites, stepdown units) including adaptations to standard staffing and resource practices to provide functionally equivalent medical care, with minimal increase in risk to the patient. c. Crisis: providing sufficient care under the circumstances with significant changes to standard staffing and resource practices (e.g., using an oxygen-saturation monitor with high/low rate alarms instead of usual cardiac and other monitors, tiered staffing so one nurse/physician with critical care expertise supervises several staff with lesser degrees of training that provide the bedside care) that may significantly impact patient morbidity and mortality.",
          "1. An incident management system (Hospital Incident Command System or alternative nationally compliant system) [8, 9] is in place at the facility. This assures that in addition to using appropriate incident command positions and terminology that the process of management by objectives and utilization of formal and practiced planning cycles to generate incident action plans (IAP) for the next operational period is followed. The Hospital Emergency Executive Control Group coordinates these activities (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). 2. Coordination agreements and systems with neighboring/regional health care facilities are put in place [10] by the Local, Regional or National Emergency Executive Control Group (see Chap. 3: Coordination and collaboration of interface units). These may cross jurisdictional and even national boundaries. The importance of resource-balancing across multiple institutions cannot be overemphasized. During a single-site event, expedient patient transfer to those facilities with resources provides the best care possible, and during a pervasive event (such as a pandemic), S12 inter-facility coordination assures a consistent standard of care across a given region. 'Regions' are usually defined functionally for hospitals rather than geographically (as is the case for emergency management), and planning should include usual referral partners regardless of geographic boundaries. 3. The hospital has an ICU, operating rooms, postanesthesia care, stepdown/intermediate care units and procedure areas (may include respiratory/gastrointestinal procedure rooms or outpatient surgery/procedure areas) [11] [12] [13] 4. The hospital has prepared for MCEs including stockpiling equipment, medications and basic supplies [11, 12] . This should include planning for special populations regardless of the hospital's role in the community (for example, a hospital that does not usually provide burn or pediatric care may have to provide care for these patients during an incident that overwhelms or damages usual community resources). 5. The hospital has one ventilator per critical care bed [12] but can obtain limited additional ventilators within 6-12 h.",
          "Lines of authority 1. The hospital incident manager [9] has overall decisionmaking authority to implement surge capacity or any other systematic decisions involved in the response. Depending on the organization of the system, the hospital incident manager optimally may answer to (or at least coordinate with) an over-arching governmental entity and be providing institutional direction informed by higher level situational awareness and objectives. Critical care staff (unit nursing supervisor or physician depending on availability) at hospitals should be prepared to act within their authority to:",
          "a. Inform the incident manager about the status and capacity of ICU services and their resource needs. These updates should occur as soon as possible after event declaration and be updated every few hours until the influx of patients has stabilized (after a no-notice event) at which point twice-daily reporting is likely to be sufficient unless specific circumstances require an update. 1 Unless temporary, requires state empowerment, clinical guidance, and protection for triage decisions and authorization for alternate care sites/techniques. Once situational awareness has been achieved, triage decisions should be as systematic and integrated into institutional process, review and documentation as possible.",
          "2 Institutions consider impact on the community of resource use (consider ''greatest good'' versus individual patient needs, e.g., conserve resources when possible), but patient-centered decision making is still the focus. 3 Institutions (and providers) should make triage decisions balancing the availability of resources to others and the individual patient's needs-shift to community-centered decision making S13 e. Change staffing patterns and hours to provide the most appropriate coverage based on the demands of the incident.",
          "1. Critical care surge capacity-critical care is expanded across a continuum of physical space reflected below from conventional to crisis capacity.",
          "The institutional plan should provide for a phased expansion of critical care appropriate to the incident demands. Hospitals should be able to increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICUs and other areas with appropriate beds and monitors. Increases beyond 25% over usual capacity are unlikely with the current H1N1 virus. Future mutations, outbreaks or MCE may require maximum feasible expansion of capacity. This maximal feasible number will vary between institutions and countries, and be determined by the number of excess ICU patients, the usual ICU bed proportion of the total population and the maximum feasible expansion. As noted above, one group recommended a 300% expansion target, but many facilities may not be able to reach this target [3] and should consider phased expansion to double capacity. a. Conventional: involves spaces usually used for critical care. Occupancy and staffing of existing beds is Request additional staffing as needed for post-anesthesia care (6 beds), pre-induction (6 beds) and special procedures/outpatient surgery unit (12 beds up to 24 beds) 3. Move stable ICU patients to step-down units, move step-down and rule-outs to non-monitored beds as appropriate 4. Transfer patients from monitored to non-monitored beds as appropriate 5. Staff gastroenterology laboratory and cardiac outpatient area if required 6. Move cots to pre-designated discharge holding area/waiting areas for holding patients pending transfers and clearing rooms 7. Assess with Planning Chief need to activate regional transfer plan and for additional/follow-on staff and material resources Crisis care 1. Add cots or stretchers, transfer stable critical care patients with less resource demand to medicine floors (medical units are preferred by location to surgery, neurology, pediatric floor beds due to location) according to demand based on surge capacity worksheet 2. Note additional beds created in units and halls do not have dedicated monitoring systems. Call bioelectronics for any additional spares and ask that they pull Accident & Emergency (A&E) orthopedic area monitors, crash cart monitors, and depending on needs may move portable monitors from surgery/procedure areas. May need to make request to other facilities or discontinue cardiac/invasive monitoring to decrease demand. Can also use saturation monitor for high/low rate alarm-respiratory care can assist re-allocation of saturation monitors 3. Assess situation with Planning Section Chief-as above-if internal/external transfers will not allow patients to move off cots within 6 h then: Decompression/demobilization In conjunction with incident manager prepare patient lists for transfer-focus on those that are stable or with resource needs that are difficult to meet in the current environment but do not preclude transfer. As more resources and staff become available and transfers are made to other institutions, transition critical care back to contingency and then conventional locations, restoring normal operations and care locations",
          "Note that these represent a small portion of an overall surge capacity plan (which itself is a portion of the institutional emergency operations plan) and should be tailored to the needs of the facility maximized, including moving appropriate patients to step-down care from ICU (facilitated by having preexisting 'bump lists'), increasing staffing through callbacks and holding staff as needed. This should be coupled with hospital-wide implementation of the same strategies of maximal bed use including 'surge discharge' that prioritize floor patients for early discharge or movement to other holding areas/hall beds per unit protocol so that adequate space can be created for ICU patient transfers [14, 15] . Discharge holding areas should be pre-identified, and processes for patient assessment and rapid discharge should be in place if patients are to move efficiently between the emergency department (ED)/accident and emergency (A&E), operating suites, ICUs and inpatient floors. For example, a lounge or waiting area may be designated as an area where patients designated for early discharge can be moved while awaiting final orders, medications and transportation in order to more quickly make these beds available for incoming patients. This is of particular utility in a 'no-notice' or sudden event. During a more prolonged event, selective admission and surgical strategies (deferring elective procedures and selective scheduling of other procedures) will be of prominent value in maintaining maximal critical care resources. b. Contingency: utilizes spaces that can provide comparable services to true ICU beds with supervising staff that have critical care skills. This would include use of pre-and post-anesthesia care units (PACU), operating suites (especially in procedure areas), procedure rooms [gastroenterology (GI), respiratory, interventional radiology], step-down units/monitored units and potentially emergency department beds (though competing priorities for use will impact incident manager decisions about which spaces to use). The overall objective is to concentrate care for the least stable and most critically ill in the conventional critical care areas and move those that are more stable or with lower resource requirements to other areas of care. Key infrastructure features include the ability to provide usual cardiac and oxygen saturation monitoring, intravenous medications and drips and mechanical ventilation [11] [12] [13] . In preparing hospitals for a crisis, locations should be prioritized in the following order: expanding existing ICUs, postanesthesia care units and emergency departments to capacity, then step-down units, large procedure suites, telemetry units and finally hospital wards [12] . Infection control personnel should create a phased plan to accommodate larger numbers of patients with highly infectious diseases as this may be different than planning for patients that do not require isolation.",
          "Hospitals should balance ICU needs and the potential decreasing benefits of increasing ICU capacity (because of excess workload) with other hospital needs that may suffer more as services are depleted. Staff for these areas (anesthesia, surgery, critical care, emergency) should have a high degree of comfort managing the critically ill, at least on a short-term basis. Hospital incident 'worksheets' should be developed that map and prioritize care areas for use based on ability to monitor the patient rooms, proximity to existing critical care or step-down units, and institution-specific factors (for example, PACU and pre-anesthesia care first, followed by conversion of step-down unit to ICU level care, etc.) ( Table 2) . Staff and equipment considerations should be pre-planned so that critical care staff can supervise overall care for critical patients while reducing their hands-on patient care responsibilities ('increasing the altitude of supervision' to oversee a larger number of patients) [11, 12] . Ventilators are expensive and difficult to stockpile, but contingency plans at the facility and government (local, state, provincial, national) levels should provide for some additional ventilators. Planned criteria for re-distribution of equipment (use of oxygen saturation monitors restricted to those that are on ventilators or on high-flow oxygen, for example, with spot checks for others) or conservation of equipment (what medications should be given by pumps vs. those that can safely be given by gravity flow) may facilitate implementation during an event [3, 16] . Prioritization of support services (minimizing tests ordered, laboratory and radiology restricting services to essential tests and diagnostics, use of alternative diagnostics-for example, ultrasound rather than computed tomography for abdominal imaging) is also required and should be institution-wide. Restrictions on utilization of diagnostics (laboratory, radiology) should increase with demand in pre-planned phases. The phased response for H1N1 may last several weeks [1, 2] . c. Crisis: provision of 'sufficient' critical care in areas that are not designed for high-intensity care, for example, using floor beds with an oxygen saturation monitor (with high/low rate and low saturation alarms) for a patient on a ventilator and using staff that do not have significant training in critical care to provide basic care (basic nursing care, vital signs monitoring, etc.) with an even higher 'altitude' of the critical care nurses and physicians supervising these providers (e.g., critical care nursing and physician staff round on the patients at scheduled intervals to provide guidance to the primary nursing and physician staff and are available for consultation/questions). Should demand exceed resource capacity for specific equipment (e.g., ventilators, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation equipment), with no resources expected and no transfers possible [7, 17] , triage processes should be implemented that have been pre-planned to the extent possible and are consistent with the community standard of care and any state, provincial or national guidance.",
          "Central system considerations 1. Oxygen a. Remodeling or building projects at a hospital should consider incorporating oxygen ports (or extra ports) into patient rooms, meeting rooms, etc., to facilitate conversion to patient care areas or the accommodation of additional beds in usual areas. However, safety considerations are paramount, as these systems may not be used often and yet still require regular inspection and testing. Multi-patient regulators are available that can serve multiple patients on variable oxygen flow rates from a single wall port, and these may be useful for providing cohort care, particularly in flat-space areas such as meeting rooms, etc. Though this does not provide critical care, it can open beds up that can be used for critical care and thus is a valuable part of planning. b. Hospitals should carefully consider limitations of the oxygen supply. Even if enough ventilators or oxygen flow meters are available such that every bed in the hospital would have one, the oxygen systems for most hospitals were not designed to provide such a supply and maintain pressure within the system. Continued supply and re-supply of liquid oxygen may be another limiting factor. Hospitals should examine their oxygen delivery and storage systems for vulnerabilities. Often, there are many potential points of failure within these systems with little redundancy or recovery. It may be to the institution's advantage to duplicate liquid oxygen systems, ideally separated geographically, or at least equipped to allow an interface with a trailerbased liquid oxygen system should the primary fixed delivery system fail. 2. Suction/compressed air: suction and compressed air lines are a lower priority for incorporation into congregate care spaces (those providing low acuity non-ambulatory patient care); however, at least compressed air (and ideally suction) should be available for any spaces where mechanical ventilation is a consideration (i.e., patient rooms). Hand-held and battery-operated suction units are available and may have utility, though the availability of wall suction is far preferable because of superior performance. 3. Utilities a. Electricity: emergency generators at most hospitals do not have the capacity to power outlets in all patient rooms sufficiently for the monitors, ventilators and pumps necessary for critical care. Further, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems (including negative flow systems) may not be included or adequately powered with emergency power circuits. Critical care staff should identify which systems and outlets are included in emergency power, which are not and what the maximum load is (just because outlets are marked for emergency use does not mean that the generators can support the electrical draw if many of these outlets are used at once). The hospital should plan with jurisdictional emergency management the types and quantities of generators necessary to effectively run the facility should primary power fail and have the necessary adaptors available to wire temporary generators into the hospital system [18] . b. Water: clean water is required for many health care activities, including large volumes for hemodialysis. Hospital planners may be unaware of the water needs for critical care activities and should work with critical care to forecast needs and identify suppliers and an operating procedure. c. Continuity of operational planning: the ability of the institution to provide critical care depends on the maintenance of the operating infrastructure. Water and utilities are separated from these because of the specific considerations above, but the availability of lighting, communications, information technology, fire suppression, heating/ventilation/air conditioning, nutrition services, laboratory, radiology and many other support and infrastructure services is not assured and critical care planners should be familiar with planning for maintaining general hospital operations during outages and other incidents [19, 20] . Functional roles and responsibilities of the internal personnel and interface agencies or sectors (these should be defined prior to the event and the specific actions to be taken listed in job action sheets or other resources that the care providers and incident management team can reference during an event) with resource acquisition (particularly for non-medical supplies such as security personnel for traffic control, etc.), coordinates the response on the jurisdictional level, and depending on the regional construct may assist with arranging patient transfers. This group assists with Emergency Medical Services and other patient transportation resources. b. Health care systems: provide mutual aid including resources and staff to disproportionately affected hospitals. Depending on regional constructs, these systems ideally have a coordinating entity that establishes priorities of response and resource assignments, coordinates patient transfers, and works with other stakeholder agencies to obtain necessary staff, resources and emergency declarations. Hospital personnel should understand how these systems work in their area and practice using them prior to an event [3, 10] .",
          "Logistics support and requirements necessary for the effective implementation of the SOP Incident management framework, institutional mobilization (disaster) plan, pre-existing phased implementation plans for capacity expansion, materials and resources appropriate to the plans (scope determined by institutional commitment and financial resources) and mechanism for monitoring, requesting and receiving resources [22] [23] [24] are required.",

The SOP should be redrafted as needed based on the experiences, or additional preparedness/planning activities may need to occur.",
          "Education on these changes is conducted, and the plan exercised again. Too often hospital disaster exercises stop with the patients being processed through the ED/A&E and do not require inpatient decision-making.",
          "Effective augmentation of critical care services at a hospital requires substantial planning prior to the event, with integration of planning efforts across multiple services at the hospital and the engagement of community and government partners. Development of a phased critical care expansion plan addressing staff, space and supplies in conjunction with hospital administration and emergency management personnel should be a priority with the ongoing 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",
