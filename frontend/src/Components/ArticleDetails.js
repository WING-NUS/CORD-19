        "Located in the north of France, Picardy region has a population of 1.925 million inhabitants on a 19 399 km² territory. A network of 29 general hospitals is located on this regional territory, with 128 intensive care units (ICU) beds. The only ICU of Picardy with the ability to manage ECMO is the Cardiac Thoracic Vascular and Respiratory Unit of Amiens University medical Centre. The unit initiated about 60 ECMO treatments every year (one third of veno-venous ECMO) for more than 10 years.",
        "The outbreak occurred in Picardy at the end of February 2020 resulting in a rapid tension on ICU beds. Calls from peripheral centres for ECMO need increased rapidly. In one month (March 2020), 676 patients were admitted in the hospitals of the region for COVID-19 related disease. Among them 156 patients required ICU admission (admission rate: 23.1%).3\n",
        "Clustering infected patients requiring ECMO within an expert centre was necessary in order to insure adequate care and resource management.",
        "A unique phone number was publicized to all ICUs of the region in order to centralize request for ECMO. An on-call ECMO team member was able to give advice and to evaluate the need for ECMO. All ECMO team members were educated on the management and the eligibility criteria for ECMO initiation. The mobile ECMO team was composed by a specialized intensivist, a thoracic surgeon and a trained perfusion nurse. A roster was started in order to make the team available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Decision to initiate ECMO treatment was always a multi-consultant decision. The ECMO team was able to reach any hospital of the region in less than 45 minutes (by road or by air depending on the weather). The ECMO team decided on arrival to retrieve the patient on conventional ventilation or to initiate ECMO on site and transfer the patient on ECMO support. Patients under ECMO were admitted in a specialized ICU with trained staff. The Cardiohelp® (Maquet Medical system, Wayne, USA) ECMO device was used for each transport because of its compact and light design (10kg).",
        "During March 2020, 22 calls were received at our ECMO centre. The ECMO team initiated 8 veno-venous ECMO treatments on site and transferred 3 patients on conventional ventilation. For all patients, the drainage cannula (size of 25 Fr) was inserted in the right femoral vein and the return cannula (size of 19 Fr) was inserted in the right jugular vein. Heparin treatment was started after the procedure with continuous perfusion of unfractioned heparin for an anti-XA level target of 0,2-0,4 UI.ml−1. Despite this treatment, canula thrombosis occurred for 2 patients leading to procedure failure and death of the patients. This is probably due to the high inflammatory state that increases the risk of thrombosis as suggested in some reports.4 The ECMO team was not available 3 times due to simultaneous calls. Only one ECMO was initiated during night shift. Four patients (50%) were discharged from ICU. Characteristics, outcomes and complications of patients were detailed in table 1\n. The role of ECMO in covid-19-related ARDS is still unclear. To date, only limited case-series are available. Our report is in accordance with previous reports on limited cases-series of Covid-19 patients under ECMO support. Li et al. reported a similar rate of 50% of weaning for 8 patients under ECMO.5 Jacobs et al. in a larger case-series of 32 covid-19 patients under ECMO, have a weaning rate of 16% (5/32) but the majority of their ECMO treatment were still ongoing at time of publication.6 To the contrary to other team, we performed only veno-venous ECMO therapies as all treated patients were hemodynamically stable without acute ventricular dysfunction.7\n",
        "To conclude, the setup of a mobile ECMO team within an experienced ECMO centre is feasible and may help to tackle the outbreak. To date, there is only limited case-series on ECMO for covid-19 patients and larger studies are mandatory to draw any conclusion. However, sharing experience between ECMO expert centers is necessary to improve our practice.",

        "It is now over 30 years since the first AIDS case was reported in Los Angeles in the United States in 1981, after which AIDS began to spread worldwide. As of the end of 2011, the number of HIV-positive people worldwide had reached 34 million. In response to this situation, the United Nations released its 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS. As of 2012, 186 countries or 96 % of United Nations members had submitted a report on their national AIDS-response measures (UNAIDS) [4]. Figure 5.1 indicates the size of HIV-positive populations, showing from left to right the infection rates among adults, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. It is striking that the HIV-positive rate among drug injectors is 22 times higher than among the general population.\n",
        "The background to this situation regarding HIV infection is a story of massive spread of infection through an accident with ‘high-risk biotechnologies’ [5]. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal refers to a series of cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, caused by the failure to apply safety measures to blood products. Included in these blood products were coagulation-factor products, which are pharmaceuticals effective against hemophilia. The raw material for these products is prepared from the blood of many donors, and the lack of a procedure for virus inactivation left no defense against viral infection. The reported discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 led to concerns over the risk of infection through blood products, but despite the warnings from many specialists, the use of these products continued and resulted in some 2,000 cases of HIV infection. According to a 1997 White Paper from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, of the 4,028 people with HIV as of February 1997, 1,872 had been infected by blood products. Meanwhile, of the 1,484 people who had developed AIDS symptoms, 641 had been infected by blood products. The reality was that almost half of those with HIV infection were victims of the scandal. This affair raised issues regarding the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the culpability of the involved organizations and individuals in industry (pharmaceutical manufacturers); in government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare); and in academia (the AIDS Research Group led by Dr. Z).",
        "Iatrogenic HIV infection differs from many other cases of iatrogenic drug damage in that it is a ‘progressive condition’. What this means is that even when use of the drugs stops, the progression of the symptoms does not. This is because iatrogenic HIV infection arises not from the drug’s side-effects, as with most other cases of iatrogenic drug damage, but from viral contamination of the blood that is the raw material for the drugs (Osaka HIV) [6]. In the absence of effective therapy, HIV causes a gradual weakening of the immune system, leading to the onset of AIDS. As of July 1998, there had been 493 deaths from iatrogenic HIV infection, while the number infected was 1,434, of whom 631 had developed AIDS. The number of deaths continues to increase. The fact that many children were affected is another distinctive feature of iatrogenic HIV infection, making all the more urgent the task of limiting the damage and developing therapies. Of those affected, 14 % were 10 years old or younger, while 30 % were 15 years or below, and those aged 20 or below accounted for more than half of all victims. This is why, in the first report by the Research Group for Preventive Therapies for People with HIV Infection, the group’s chief researcher, Professor K. Yamada, called iatrogenic HIV infection “one of the greatest medical tragedies of this century”. The group’s report is subtitled The AIDS Scandal [7].",
        "Table 5.1 summarizes the iatrogenic HIV problem in terms of the number of HIV-infected people and the (estimated) number infected by blood products in the major developed countries. The number of people infected iatrogenically through pharmaceuticals is particularly high in the United States and France, indicating that the damage was spread through a combination of natural and human-made disasters. In many countries including Japan, court actions were brought against the government and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In Spain, where 90 % of blood-coagulant products were imports from the United States, it is reported that 82 % of the 2,700 hemophiliacs became infected with HIV (Osaka HIV) [8].\n",
        "In the case of the ‘non-heat-treated’ coagulation-factor products which were the medium of infection, although there were safety issues involved, the fact remained that they were effective for many hemophiliacs and user-friendly. The coagulation-factor products had a stronger pharmaceutical effect than the cryoprecipitate preparations which were candidate replacements, and, when symptoms became severe, there were apparently cases in which only coagulation-factor products could elicit recovery. Moreover, self-injection of coagulation-factor products by hemophiliacs was authorized in February 1983, offering a greater degree of user-friendliness than cryoprecipitate, which in principle had to be administered in a hospital. As HIV research was less advanced than nowadays, many doctors and patients opted for the immediate benefits of pharmaceutical efficacy and user-friendliness in the face of an unknown future risk, resulting in the unforeseen human-made medical disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection.",
        "Central government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) continued to assume the role of the supervision and guidance authority for pharmaceutical approval and licensing in its relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pharmaceutical manufacturers submitted detailed reports on risk data and other information to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which provided them with guidance on the range of countermeasures. The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected information from overseas specialists, but this information was not communicated to medical treatment institutions, patients, or the general public. At the time of the first confirmed case, the Ministry tried to prepare a ‘soft landing’ for AIDS in Japan. Similarly, so as to avoid panic among the public and unequal treatment of companies, it continued to advocate a softly-softly approach. In court, too, the government went on to adopt the role of director and defender of the accused companies. In addition to this aspect, there was a strong significance attached to the fact that the disease was infectious, which meant that the damage spread through secondary and tertiary infection. Surprisingly, as the Ministry initially treated HIV as a public health and sanitation issue, it did not provide victims with medical treatment, relief or compensation, thinking of the infection rather as a social evil which needed to be rooted out and eliminated.",
        "Detailed information on the timeline of the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal has appeared on the website of Life AIDS Project and in a book by Hitoshi Sakurai entitled Umoreta eizu hōkoku (The Buried AIDS Report) [9]. The timeline presented below was prepared with reference to these sources and is based on factual information already released into the public domain.\n",
        "Hemophilia, a disease in which constituents required for blood clotting and hemostasis are lacking or deficient for genetic reasons, requires medical treatment to supply these missing blood-coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitates products were used as drugs to control the disease [10]. As cryoprecipitate products are made from the pooled blood of one or at the most ten individuals, it was expected that they would be less likely to cause infection than coagulation-factor products, which are made from the pooled blood of between 2,000 and 20,000 people [11]. As the first cryoprecipitate were frozen products, their storage and use presented challenges, and patients had to be treated in hospital, but this problem was resolved by the dried cryoprecipitate developed in the early 1980s, and home treatment using cryoprecipitate did apparently take place in some cases. In countries such as Norway, which actually switched to cryoprecipitate, the rate of hemophiliac HIV infection was kept to low levels, indicating effective decision-making on health policy. This fact casts doubt on the basis of Dr. Z’s statement that ‘cryoprecipitate is liable to solidification’, and instead points to the difference in drug-price markup as one of the possible reasons why the switch to cryoprecipitate was not realized.",
        "From 1984 until around 1985, many Japanese doctors viewed as specialists and many officials at the Ministry of Health and Welfare were apparently dominated by the ‘logical argument’ that “although use of blood products can lead to HIV infection, many patients have not developed symptoms. Infection and onset of symptoms are thus separate phenomena. Although ‘non-heated products’ may be a cause of HIV infection, they do not act to cause AIDS onset” [12]. AIDS is a disease of immune dysfunction caused by a virus called HIV. In a document published in 1986, Dr. Z maintained that confirmation of AIDS requires three conditions to be fulfilled [13]. The first was infection with the AIDS virus, which could be tested via the presence of antibodies. The second was reduced or insufficient immunocompetence. The fact that this reduction of immunocompetence occurs over time is one of the characteristics of AIDS. For reduced immune function to result in the onset of symptoms can take more than 10 years in many cases, until which time the patient may experience no more than a certain degree of fatigue, with no impairment of everyday activities. This is still one of the features that distinguish HIV infection from the onset of AIDS. The third of Dr. Z’s conditions was opportunistic infection, which appears as a result of weakened immunocompetence in the form of illnesses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma. As a result, medical treatment following the onset of AIDS consists of a constant battle with opportunistic infections.",
        "Figure 5.2 shows the number of new HIV and AIDS infections and deaths in the two subsequent decades from 1990 to 2010. Many HIV-infected patients die each year; the total number of those infected is shown in the figure. When we consider also the number of AIDS deaths due to non-pharmaceutical-related natural infection, such as infection through unprotected sex or needle-sharing, the extent of the tragedy is immeasurable. The problem of iatrogenic AIDS thus continues into the present.\n",
        "In the case of iatrogenic HIV infection, the main point of legal contention was at what juncture pharmaceutical manufacturers and the Ministry of Health and Welfare had become aware of the risk from non-heated products. The case in point in the criminal trial was that of a liver-disease patient treated with non-heated products from the pharmaceutical company Green Cross Corporation in April 1986. The court attempted to trace why the president of the corporation had not recalled the products, and why Mr. Y, the then head of the Biologics and Antibiotics Division at the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, had not ordered a recall.",
        "Since pharmaceutical manufacturers were also in a position to access risk data, they were unable to deny their involvement in the manufacture and sale of drugs potentially contaminated with the virus. Information from pharmaceutical manufacturers was reported to the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, but was not communicated to the hemophiliacs who were the product consumers. The Ministry thereby clearly neglected its duty to warn patients and the public. As for non-heated products, while most other countries reduced their imports, Japan sought to increase imports and even reduced the price as an incentive. The reason for the import of unsafe ‘non-heated products’ was quite simply the prioritization of earnings from the markup on the drug price. This is the profit derived from the difference between the fixed domestic price for medical products and the price actually paid to the overseas supplier. The markup on non-heated products was particularly great. With cryoprecipitate products, in contrast, there was almost none. There are also issues associated with the actions of those involved after the danger was realized: even after heated products became available, they failed to urgently recall the non-heated products which they knew to be unsafe. By making false reports to the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the dates of market release and recall of non-heated products, the Green Cross Corporation engaged in fraud and misrepresentation compounding the damage, for which it bears a grave ‘social responsibility.’",
        "Figure 5.3, stakeholders of the pharmaceutical industry, presents a diagrammatic illustration of the interest groups in the industry involved in the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing. As shown, Green Cross effectively engaged in bribery, which included making payments, disguised as ‘research funds’, to a foundation that Dr. Z was in the process of establishing, suggesting that the ‘business ethics’ of this pharmaceutical operator were very poor. Its approach, which prioritized its own interest at the expense of patients and the public, aggravated the damage. However, this kind of poor practice was not restricted to the corporate players; responsibility also lies with the government authorities that administered the pharmaceutical regulatory system, which became ever clearer as the Japanese media (NHK) delved more deeply into the scandal.\n",
        "The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had the role of providing supervision and guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Notwithstanding its name change to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare following a ministerial reorganization, its historic responsibility for the iatrogenic HIV infection remains, together with its duty to compensate patients and victims. This raises the question of the political and administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities. Although it may not have been deliberately responsible, if it is the case that the former Ministry of Health and Welfare sacrificed the health of hemophiliacs for the sake of pharmaceutical manufacturers’ profit, then the regulatory authority itself has become a malignant influence on society, a situation that calls for the establishment of an ethical code for government organizations. The pharmaceutical regulatory system has been called a ‘web of vested interests’. The sorting of good medicines from bad is carried out under government guidance through a process known as pharmaceutical inspection, but, paradoxically, there is greater interest vested in bad medicines than in good medicines. Pharmaceutical companies make massive capital investment in drug development and have to adapt to new raw materials and a new production line for each new drug. They need to recoup this investment, and the development of a single drug is thus a kind of venture project that can determine the entire fate of the company.",
        "Because of this, once a drug had been developed, since it was no longer possible to halt the investment in the associated production plant, the company would approach official bodies and the specialist committees and research groups that had the effective decision-making authority within the pharmaceutical-inspection system of the former Ministry of Health and Welfare with the intention of having the drug approved, regardless of its merit. It was this network of interests surrounding pharmaceutical regulation that formed the backdrop to the tragedy of iatrogenic HIV infection. Meanwhile, the inspection procedures and clinical studies involved in drug licensing under the government regulatory system require time, something which often stands in the way of delivering medical treatment to patients who need the drug. Indeed, one wonders what the purpose of the government regulatory system is, and whether the clinical studies involved in pharmaceutical inspection have any useful effect. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal provoked a loss of confidence in the pharmaceutical regulatory system, and the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and initiated a fundamental questioning of the whole of Japan’s medical-treatment policy.",
        "The administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities involved in the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) was the focus of the court case. In court, the basis for the questioning of the Ministry’s responsibility was the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was amended in 1979 in response to the SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) case. The amendment gave the Ministry the authority to close down the supply of a pharmaceutical where there was the risk of it creating or aggravating a health or safety hazard. At issue was the failure to exercise this authority, in other words negligence on the part of the regulatory authority. Specifically, it can be pointed out, for instance, that Japan lagged behind the United States by 2 years and 4 months in the approval of heated products. This was largely attributable to the coordination of clinical studies by Dr. Z, but another probable issue was the structure whereby the former Ministry of Health and Welfare’s pharmaceutical-licensing operation was dependent on a small number of specialists. Table 5.2 summarizes the dates from which HIV-antibody testing and heat treatments of concentrated products were made obligatory.\n",
        "Documents now made public suggest that, although the former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected a large amount of risk data, it not only did not make the data public but may actually have manipulated the advice from the FDA. AIDS was first recognized in Japan on March 22, 1985, with the reporting of the case of a male homosexual resident in the United States, which became known as the Juntendo University case. The patient survived for 10 years after diagnosis, and, although infected with HIV, is thought to have been yet to develop AIDS at that time. In contrast, a hemophiliac who died in July 1983, known as the Teikyo University case, was not recognized as an AIDS patient. It has been claimed that this was because the former Ministry of Health and Welfare tried to conceal the fact of hemophiliac HIV infection. Even subsequent to the licensing of heated products, the Ministry exacerbated the damage by failing to order pharmaceutical manufacturers to recall unheated products. Underlying this lax leadership is a readily perceptible collusion between the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Green Cross Corporation of those days was described as an outpost of the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and the practice of amakudari, whereby officials from the Ministry frequently retired into sinecure positions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, led to the formation of strong collusive relationships in the area of pharmaceutical approval and licensing (Mainichi Shimbun Shakaibu) [14].",
        "As shown in Fig. 5.4, the background to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal was formed not only by the various contributions of industry, government and academia, but also by the undeniable fact of mutual interorganizational relationships among the three based on an ‘industrial protection policy’ peculiar to what has been called Japan Inc. It was surely the collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia based on the ‘vulnerable systems’ in Japanese society [15]—a negative result of the interrelationship of organizations in Japan’s industrial society—that lay behind the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal.\n",
        "The head of the AIDS Research Group, Dr. Z, was at the time Japan’s foremost expert in hemophilia treatment, and was thus an influential and authoritative voice in the field of medicine relevant to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal. The AIDS Research Group was in fact heavily involved in important decisions that led to the compounding of the damage from the iatrogenic HIV infection, such as the decision not to switch from coagulation-factor products to cryoprecipitate products. Specifically, at the meeting of the Home Treatment Promotion Committee on October 18, 1983, Dr. Z said in respect of his earlier claim that ‘cryoprecipitate tends to solidify’ that it might not be true. At a time when there were doubts over the safety of blood products, a grave responsibility attaches to his decisions not to switch to cryoprecipitate products, and then to delay the clinical study of the heated products when he should have been working to provide a safer drug as quickly as possible. In connection, it was found that doctors had had financial dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which was proven by the fact that Green Cross had made donations, disguised as research funds, to a foundation established by Dr. Z.",
        "As part of the July 1997 reorganization of the pharmaceutical regulatory structure recommended in the 1997 Annual Report on Health and Welfare, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau was abolished, and the Health Policy Bureau took control of policy on the promotion of pharmaceutical research and development, pharmaceutical production and distribution, and related aspects. Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau was created to oversee the broad range of safety measures relating to medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, such as pharmaceutical clinical studies, approval and inspection, post-marketing safety measures, and measures to prevent infection within medical-treatment institutions. In parallel, as part of a strategic upgrade and reorganization of testing and research institutions, the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences was reconstituted as the National Institute of Health Sciences, and was equipped with a Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center to promote survey and research work on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs and strengthen pharmaceutical inspection. To coincide with the reorganization, there was a systematic increase in the number of staff assigned to pharmaceutical inspection work, and the inspection system was changed: whereas previously the actual work of inspection had been delegated to the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, whose members were drawn from the outside, the core work of pharmaceutical inspection was now to be carried out in-house by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center, with the Council’s role specialized to cover high-level assessment. Urgent steps were to be taken to set up a corresponding system of responsibilities. The system of clinical-study principal investigators, which had been Dr. Z’s role in the licensing of heated products, was abolished.",
        "The new medical-product approval and inspection system created by the reorganization of government agencies came into force in 1997. In subsequent administrative reforms, the former Ministry of Health and Welfare became the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare, and there were changes in the content of its administrative activities including services provided and approval and licensing operations. Under the previous system, Inspection Guidelines and Inspection Reports were submitted to the Investigation Committee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, which was made up of specialists from outside the Ministry. This system was replaced in November 2000 by a simplified format in which the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council participated in a so-called team inspection. This move appears to have been designed to shorten the time required for approval.",
        "In the final analysis, the cause of the iatrogenic HIV infection lay in a system in which the government agencies that constituted the pharmaceutical regulatory authorities were essentially bypassed so that the effective ‘decision-making’ body for drug clinical-study approval was the specialist committee known as the AIDS Research Group, to which pharmaceutical manufacturers made donations in an effort to have their pharmaceuticals approved and licensed, thus interfering in the process of pharmaceutical approval and license renewal. In future, lessons must be drawn from the iatrogenic HIV infection, and reform must be applied to the web of interests in the pharmaceutical industry and its system of cozy collusive relationships with government agencies. The poor practice and collusive relationships arising from the network of interests linking the worlds of industry and government also exemplify the need to reform, in terms of both policies and systems, the ethos and culture which became entrenched during Japan’s earlier period of rapid economic growth. An existing organizational culture must not be allowed to prevent the organization from learning to find its way in a new age. Dismantling the old culture of the past and creating a new culture is an important process. The culture of poor practice which is latent within the pharmaceutical regulatory system and the pharmaceutical industry represents a form of ‘organizational inertia’ which still today retains the power to act against the public interest. The culture and ethos latent in this network of collusive relationships among Japanese industry, government, and academia may need to be the subject of creative destruction as we move into the near future.",
        "It is clear that responsibility for the organizational disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection lies at once with industry, government, and academia, but the background to this is the industrial-protection policy of Japan Inc., which is deeply rooted in the culture of the pharmaceutical industry. The system for approval and licensing, as administered by the regulatory government authority for each industry, itself spawned a network of collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia through practices such as amakudari, donations from private-sector bodies to the public sector, and expense-account entertaining. The case of iatrogenic HIV infection can be seen as a negative result of this relationship between business and government. This underlines the fragility of the ‘cultural ethos’ [16] of Japanese industrial organizations and typifies a system common to all of Japanese industrial society: a veritable ‘Galapagos, a strange, isolated world’.",
        "Human-made disasters such as the phenomenon of iatrogenic AIDS infection outlined above have an inevitable ‘teleconnection’ with natural disasters. New viral strains and infectious diseases are one form of ‘unsafety threatening humankind.’ Historically, tuberculosis, cholera, plague, influenza, AIDS, and other infectious diseases have claimed many victims. More recently, the worldwide spread of SARS and avian influenza in 2003 is fresh in our memory. There are fears of epidemics of the three major infectious diseases (AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis) arising from the ‘biological hazard’ caused by the world population explosion to 7.2 billion. The particular danger of biological hazard is its exponential pattern of spread. Explosive damage arises through bacterial and viral infection via living organisms, person-to-person infection, or cross-species infection, for example from cattle to humans through bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), and foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, rubella infection in pregnant women may cause cataracts and glaucoma, congenital heart disease, hearing impairment, and other conditions in the fetus, while congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) poses the risk of damage to the next generation. Whether this is regarded as a case of human-made or natural selection, the result is the same: the disaster leads to an indivisible resonance phenomenon, the negative interaction of which causes the accelerated spread of ‘unsafety’.",
        "The WHO has published Fig. 5.5 worldwide to signal the risk from biological hazards. The northward spread of infectious tropical diseases caused by recent global warming is proceeding at an ever-accelerating pace. Among the hazards facing the world, the proportion represented by these biological hazards is second in number only to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, typhoons and hurricanes, and accounts for one-third of all hazards.\n",
        "Meanwhile, there is concern that global warming’s disruption of the energy balance may allow the spread of infectious tropical diseases to the northern hemisphere. The serious prevalence of West Nile fever in the United States resulted from its being spread to the temperate zone of North America by travelers. In Japan, similarly, the example of the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti), which was discovered in Osaka Prefecture and has extended its habitat to the whole country, demonstrates that this is not an insubstantial problem. In particular the recent prevalence of Dengue-fever, whose incidence has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years, means that over 100 countries are threatened by the growth of the domain of infection (WHO) [17]. Figure 5.6 shows areas with high risk of Dengue-fever infection as of 2011. The lines to the north and south of the figure indicate the minimum temperature of 10 °C delineating the habitat limit of the mosquito that transmits the Dengue-fever virus. Advancing northward like an army, global warming is extending the habitat of the mosquitoes that transmit tropical viruses and is pushing the infection toward the northern hemisphere, which has a large land mass and is home to a large proportion of the human race. This poses a threat to the populations of these areas, who have no experience of or resistance to tropical viruses, diehard by global-warming.\n",
        "Not only the abovementioned infectious tropical diseases transmitted by bacteria and viruses, but also the risk of infection spread through global warming and the resulting crisis, will be of increasing concern going forward. For instance, since cholera bacteria live in symbiosis with plankton in seawater, the rise in sea temperatures, causing plankton to breed more prolifically, also leads to an increase in cholera bacteria, which has extended its infection zone northward. Already, it is reported that the 1991 El Niño phenomenon in South America has led to sharp year-on-year increases in cholera cases. The IPCC report from the end of September 2013 states that the world’s average atmospheric temperature rose by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 and predicts that the temperature rise by the year 2100 will be up to a maximum of 4.8 °C, leading to fears of a ‘Global Big Melt’, which will precipitate a worldwide struggle over water and food resources (IPCC) [18]. The freshwater available on the planet for human consumption as drinking water is said to represent 0.008 % of all the earth’s H2O, so a Global Big Melt would mean the depletion of the water resources for the human population of 7.2 billion now. Especially in the northern hemisphere, which contains a high proportion of the planet’s land mass, the melting of glaciers and permafrost soil to which the Big Melt refers is predicted to lead to the spread of viral infection to previously unaffected areas. Combined with ‘trans-global movement’ of travelers and migrants, and biological weapons, terrorism, and other disasters arising from human-made unsafety, these outbreaks could spread worldwide.",
        "Governments and the responsible departments of regulatory authorities are loath to recognize ‘socio-biological hazard’. The leak and spread of radioactivity following the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, although a question of life and death for local residents, the wider community, and the Japanese population as a whole, were hidden by the government and the company involved. Socio-biological hazard thus cannot be controlled by central government policy or corporate management, which instead frequently responds with concealment or falsification of information. Nor is it susceptible to control by social or other systems. Outbreaks or pandemics of social or biological problems are accompanied by the breakdown of social functions, indicating the limitations of policy and management at the level of national government and business organization.",
        "Unlike war, coups d’état, and conflict, the influx of people into an area of hazard results in new infections as contamination with the pathogen spreads along the chain among the members of families, communities, and organizations. National governments and the WHO have, albeit discreetly, sounded the alarm over the worldwide spread of locally endemic diseases not only through mosquitoes, ticks, and migratory birds, but also through human movement (travelers on business or otherwise). A crucial role in the infection zones has been played by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, known for its role in the discovery of SARS. In such a spread of infection, as in the model predicted by J. Reason, [19] accidents and disasters leak through security holes, author which suggests a resonance between human-made and natural disasters.",
        "To summarize, the increased risks and crises brought about by global warming can emanate through leaks in physical, social, and biological defensive barriers. The resulting human-made disasters have already brought about systemic breakdown on various fronts. The ‘survivability’ which is a defensive barrier programmed into human DNA does not operate in C. I. Barnard’s so-called ‘zone of indifference’, where hazard is neither made known nor perceived. Consequently one could suggest, in many cases, hazard is only registered when a crisis emerges from the damage due to the spread of infection instigated in the breakdown of health and sanitation and other social systems and functions (Fig. 5.7).\n",
        "A comparison of viral outbreaks on a global scale, such as the worldwide pandemic of iatrogenic AIDS, reveals a similar structure. First of all, insufficient information disclosure allows an influx of people into the infection area; secondly, government measures to suppress infection and efforts at an organizational level by corporations or other bodies remain weak; and thirdly, there is a “zone of indifference outside the infection area.” These three factors create disregard for hazard information (de-civilization). Accurate publicity of ‘socio-biological hazard’ is therefore essential at the levels of international society, government, corporate organizations, and the individual, while also urgent are preventing unnecessary or unauthorized business visits or travel to the hazard area and other issues of organizational compliance and governance, together with Human Resource Management (HRM). The northward spread of tropical infectious diseases through global warming has created a need for social systems at various levels, including those of government, corporate organizations, and the individual. This means that the concept of an ‘eco-civilization’—promoting coexistence at the level of the social ecosphere, and associated disclosure of information—is the only viable approach to suppressing the combination of human-made and natural disasters that constitute socio-biological outbreaks and pandemics.",
        "In April 2002, eastern Asia was struck by the SARS virus. Following the noble efforts made by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, alerts were communicated worldwide through WHO. At the time, I was due to leave for a period of external research at IMD Lausanne, and my office urged me to proceed with the departure from Kansai Airport despite the risk of spreading the SARS infection. However, I defied them and postponed the departure. It was precisely on the day of my scheduled departure that Kansai Airport was subjected to a major disinfection operation as a precaution against SARS. The decision to postpone my departure after consulting my departmental head was a close call. If I had left on that day, I may have spread the infection to my research host institution at the IMD, and the SARS infection could have been transmitted after my return to many of my students and teaching colleagues. The conclusion to be drawn from this episode is that, going forward, whatever the field of work and in the management of organizations of all kinds, response to viral outbreaks will become an urgent task for participants in and administrators of business travel. I pray for the repose of the souls of those who died of SARS and influenza.",
        "The recent hostage killings in Algeria and the deaths of journalists in Syria serve to illustrate that the managerial staff who issue the order for overseas business trips not only have managerial responsibility for the individual organization, but may also bear lifelong moral responsibility and a duty to compensate the families of injured junior staff for their trauma and emotional suffering. Accordingly, it has become essential for modern management to prepare for socio-biological hazard in organizational management by providing managerial staff with training in risk, crisis and resilience management. Reviewing the ups and downs of the Japanese economy, one recalls that, after the collapse of the bubble economy, a large portion of the sharply increased number of suicides from overwork that resulted from mass layoffs and staff cuts was represented by managerial staff which had fired their colleagues.",
        "Coincidental though it may be, I was in the countries at the time of the military coup d’état under the Fujimori government in Peru and the coup d’état at Bangkok airport in Thailand. The Great East Japan Earthquake, the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, and the death of a student in a Japan Railways accident are also among my various experiences of accident and disaster. It was because of these that I entered my present field of research with the aim of averting suffering caused by avoidable human-made disasters. This chapter is dedicated to the world, to its people, and to humankind as a whole."

We listed the characteristics of the included studies (Table 1). Quality of studies was critically appraised (Table 2) using the Joanna Briggs Institute for Critical Appraisal of Economic Evaluations tool10 and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement.11 Our systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews): CRD42019129929 (www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=129929).

If any source study had an unknown/high ROB (identified as the weakest link), the entire economic evaluation would be assessed an unknown/high ROB. For source articles drawn from systematic reviews, guidelines documents, or economic evaluations, we did not assess ROB unless that source was not previously assessed in eAppendix 4A–D (available as ESM).

        "Among six studies examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics in CDAD (Table 3), four studies found probiotics to be cost-effective/incremental cost-saving,20,22–24 one study showed no difference,19 and one study showed cost-effectiveness in certain scenarios.23",
        "Kamdeu Fansi et al. found a cost-savings dose response for probiotics vs placebo. There was a cost-saving of 1,968 USD (2,152 CAD) for a single dose of probiotics (per CDAD case prevented) compared with placebo. For a double dose of probiotics per day, there was a cost-saving of 2,661 USD (2,910 CAD) compared with placebo.20 Leal et al. showed cost-savings of 538 CAD per patient (340 CAD for probiotics vs 878 CAD for usual care) for CDAD.21",
        "Shen et al. showed a cost-saving of 840 USD (1,150 CAD) per case of CDAD averted, with dominance of probiotics (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in the base case. Nevertheless, there were scenarios (i.e., young patients) in which the ICER was not cost-effective (age, 18–44 yr; CDAD risk, 0.6%: ICER, 884,100 USD/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] and 1,196,609 CAD/QALY).23 Furthermore, Allen et al. showed there was no difference in total healthcare costs between probiotics (£8020; 95% CI, 7620 to 8420 and (15,629 CAD; 95% CI, 14,850 to 16,409) and placebo (£8010; 95% CI, 7600 to 8420 and 15,601 CAD; 95% CI, 14,811 to 16,409).19",
        "Among three studies examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics for AAD (Table 3), two studies found probiotics to be cost-effective,22,24 with one study showing no difference between probiotics and placebo.19",
        "Lenoir-Wijnkoop et al. showed a mean cost-saving of £339 (642.94 CAD) per hospitalized patient for probiotics vs no treatment for prevention of AAD.22 Vermeersch et al. found cost-savings of €50.30 (75.74 CAD) using a bottom-up approach and €28.10 (42.31 CAD) using a top-down approach per AAD patient treated with antibiotics from a payer’s perspective. From a hospital/societal perspective, there was a cost-saving of €95.20 (143.35 CAD) (bottom-up) and €14.70 (22.13 CAD) (top-down) per AAD patient treated with probiotics.19",
        "Conversely, Allen et al. found that probiotics were not cost-effective, with an ICER for AAD prevention of £4531.36 (£3,439.80–£5,622.92; 8,830.58 CAD [6,703.39–10,957.79]), and a base-case cost-utility of £189,662 (369,608 CAD) per QALY, for a WTP threshold of < £20,000 (38,975 CAD)/QALY.19",
        "Overall, of the seven studies included, six (86%) economic evaluations favoured probiotics as cost-effective/cost-saving in the base case. Three studies (43%) were sponsored by the manufacturer (Lactobacillus acidophilus/casei/paracasei). All three reported favourable findings towards probiotics. Three of four studies without manufacturer sponsorship favoured probiotics. Publication bias cannot be excluded.",
        "The one trial-based economic evaluation did not show cost-effectiveness for its outcome,19 while all six model-based evaluations showed cost-effectiveness in their base cases and certain sensitivity analyses.18,20–24 For economic perspective subgroups, six of seven (86%) payer perspectives were cost-effective, while two of three (66%) of societal perspectives were cost-effective. For comparators, control arms (placebo vs no probiotic subgroups), two of three (66%) with placebo control arms were cost-effective, while four of four (100%) with no treatment/usual care control arms were cost-effective.",
        "The GRADE assessment46 (Table 4) found very low certainty of evidence for probiotic use for VAP, CDAD, and AAD.",
        "The outcome of VAP included one model-based economic evaluation. We downgraded for ROB (serious ROB from multiple model inputs with unclear/high ROB) and imprecision (serious for only one study in analysis).18",
        "The outcome of CDAD included six health economic evaluations (one RCT-based and five model-based). We downgraded for ROB (serious: multiple model inputs with unclear/high ROB), inconsistency (serious: one not cost-effective and five cost-effective) and imprecision (CI crosses zero for one RCT economic evaluation, with many small studies included).19–24",
        "The outcome of AAD included thee health economic evaluations (one RCT-based and two model-based). We downgraded for ROB (serious: multiple model inputs with unclear/high ROB), inconsistency (serious: one study not cost-effective, and two studies cost-effective) and imprecision (serious: CIs crossing zero in the largest RCT to date, with many small studies included).19,22,24",
        "In this systematic review of economic evaluations of probiotics in hospitalized adult patients, we found that most of the studies suggest probiotics are cost-saving/cost-effective in preventing VAP, CDAD, or AAD.18–24 Nevertheless, the largest trial-based RCT paired with a health economic evaluation to date found no difference in clinical outcomes, and no cost-effectiveness/cost-utility.19 The conclusions drawn from the collective studies in this systematic review are based on very low certainty evidence from the ROB and GRADE assessments, precluding strong inferences or definitive recommendations regarding probiotics.",
        "We found no prior systematic reviews that focused on economic evaluations of probiotic prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, hence we conducted our own. Among economic evaluations included in this review, incremental costs/ICERs were expressed in costs per healthcare-associated infection event prevented, but heterogeneity in reporting prevented meta-analysis conduction. Further, variable time horizons make comparisons of economic evaluations problematic (specifically ICERs) as costs and resource utilization may change over different time horizons. Changes in time horizons or perspectives can lead to differing parameters (costs [direct vs indirect], or outcomes [patient vs payer]). Many studies only reported incremental costs rather than true ICERs. Results from different perspectives, time horizons, and variable incremental cost reporting all represent disparate cost outcomes, which need to be interpreted carefully within context.",
        "Moreover, there are large ranges in WTP, which are difficult to interpret with no conventional WTP benchmarks for prevention of VAP, CDAD, and AAD. Different countries may differ on values quality of life and WTP, making benchmarks difficult to establish across jurisdictions. Cost-utility parameters (like cost per life-year or QALY gained) were less commonly reported. If cost per QALYs were available, it would help to inform economic comparisons with other healthcare interventions.",
        "Compared with other infection-prevention strategies, probiotics appear to be similarly cost-effective. A study examining concomitantly administered central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSIs) and VAP programs combined documented ICERs of 14,250.74 USD (20,533.24 CAD)/life-year gained and 23,277.86 USD (33,540.02 CAD)/QALY.47 Multifaceted quality improvement programs for reducing CLABSIs in ICUs have shown dominance (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in 80% of model scenarios using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.48 A proactive model infection-control program for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in general-surgical ICUs showed an ICER of 3,804 USD (5,320.01 CAD) per case averted of transmission of MDR organisms in one year compared with standard infection control. For a WTP threshold of 14,000 USD (19,579.43 CAD) per transmission averted, there is a 42% probability of being cost-effective, and 100% probability when WTP thresholds were 22,000 USD (30,767.68 CAD).49 These similarities suggest that adoption of probiotics for prevention of healthcare-associated infections could be cost-effective.",
        "New interventions studied in economic evaluations are occasionally sponsored by drug manufacturers. This potentially introduces bias in model construction and interpretation of results. In a retrospective analysis of 107 studies in five leading medical journals with regard to outcome and sources of funding, trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were more likely to favour the new drug over traditional therapy.50,51",
        "In our systematic review, three studies were funded by manufacturers and all found the sponsored intervention to be more economically attractive, which could suggest potential publication bias (although this was not proven). This is tempered by three of four peer-review funded studies that also showed cost-effectiveness. Hence, methodologically rigorous trials with concomitant economic evaluations from peer-review funded studies are needed to ensure proper interpretation of results.",
        "Strengths of our review include adherence to rigorous methodology, consisting of a comprehensive search strategy, broad eligibility criteria, and study selection by two independent adjudicators to minimize selection bias.17 We conducted data abstraction and appraisal in duplicate, using established criteria for assessing economic evaluations.11 We performed assessments of study quality employing ROB assessments, including assessment of source studies utilized in model-based economic evaluations.13–15 We performed assessment of level of certainty using GRADE.17 We also addressed the relationship of for-profit industry sponsorship potentially influencing the reporting of economic evaluations.",
        "This review also has limitations. The inclusion of only seven studies influences precision. Rare product-specific complications such as probiotic-induced complications (i.e., bacteremia) are unclear, underscoring the need for additional safety data. Overall GRADE certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes, rendering conclusions non-definitive. Our review included only adult patients and may not be applicable to pediatric populations. Evaluated reports varied widely with respect to patient population, time horizon of therapy, and payer perspective, which challenges the generalizability and interpretation of these findings.",
        "This systematic review found that probiotics may be an economically attractive strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections in most studies. Nevertheless, our GRADE summary indicates a very low quality/certainty of evidence, such that inferences are weak regarding the health economic evaluation of probiotics in adult hospitalized patients. Future RCTs should include concomitant economic evaluations, including clinical outcomes and costs associated with probiotics, to inform bedside practice, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policy. To this end, an economic evaluation of PROSPECT (E-PROSPECT) is planned."

      text: [
        "From the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has progressively spread through the world, and, on March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic [1]. Healthcare resources and staff have been immediately redeployed towards COVID-19 management, with consultations for chronic diseases being canceled, postponed, or converted to tele-medicine [1, 2]. However, in the upcoming months, COVID-19 is expected to circulate and, thus, a large amount of consultations will be converted to tele-medicine, especially for diseases causing chronic disability and requiring immunomodulatory treatments, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) [3].",
        "MS is characterized by acute-onset neurological symptoms (relapses), and chronic disability, which are primarily evaluated on neurological examination [4]. Following the COVID-19 emergency, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has published recommendations for implementing a tele-medicine service, suggesting that general neurological examination is feasible remotely, but with some caveats [5]. For instance, there are difficulties in comprehensive examination of eyes (i.e., fundoscopy), neuro-muscolar components (i.e., reflexes), and vestibular system (i.e., Dix-Hallpike maneuver), while the evaluation of other neurological systems depends on the tele-neurology setup (i.e., space enough for gait examination), and the availability of a caregiver to help (i.e., sensory examination) [5]. Remote examination could be further implemented with the use of digital technology, such as smartphone accelerometers for gait, posture, and balance assessment [6]. Similarly, over the past years, different studies have already explored the feasibility of remote counseling in MS, but have focused on specific aspects of the disease (e.g., treatment adherence, mental health) [7–9]. As such, there is no general agreement on MS-specific neurological examination on tele-consultations. Hereby, we have briefly reviewed available tools for remote evaluation of disability progression and relapses in MS, and have suggested a battery for tele-neurology examination in MS.",
        "In MS, different neurological systems are combined into the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is the standard tool for clinical practice, observational studies, and clinical trials [4]. The possibility of assessing the EDSS remotely has been explored, but would require to use an “in-home neuro kit” with vision card, tuning fork, pin, cotton swab, and alcohol swab [10], to have a caregiver helping with the examination [9, 10], and to combine records from wearable devices (e.g., accelerometer-based step counts) [7, 9]. As such, remote EDSS faces some organizational issues, which would be difficult to overcome in the short term, but could be considered when strictly required (e.g., patients included in research protocols). Also, data from wearable devices should be interpreted cautiously, considering that the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological symptoms may not necessarily correspond to reduced physical activity in patients already self-isolating at home.",
        "On the contrary, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) would remain entirely feasible online. The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) has been specifically developed as a PROM of MS disability and has been validated in multiple languages, and also for online administration [11]. The PDDS is strongly correlated to EDSS, and especially to visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and ambulatory functional systems, leaving brainstem and cerebral functions relatively unexplored [12]. As such, if patients are required to fill in the PDDS before tele-consultations, remote examination could specifically focus on brainstem function (e.g., ocular movements, trigeminal damage, hearing loss, dysarthria, and dysphagia), which is possibly easier to examine remotely or, at least, on history taking. Looking at cerebral function, different neuropsychological tests have been assessed for remote use [13]. Among them, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), which measures attention and processing speed, holds strong correlates to disability progression, and has been suggested as a screening tool for cognitive impairment in MS [14]. The oral version of the SDMT has already been validated for remote use (e.g., online or during functional-MRI acquisitions), is ideally suitable for all languages [14], and, thus, could be easily used on tele-neurology.",
        "Relapses are defined as the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological abnormalities, which are separated by ≥ 30 days from the onset of the preceding event, last for ≥ 24 h, and occur without fever or infection [4, 15]. Thus, if some elements are relatively easy to evaluate on remote history taking (e.g., timeline, concomitant fever or symptoms of infection), neurological abnormalities would need to be detected as suggested above, along with other neurological tests in relation to reported symptoms. However, relapses also affect quality of life and activities of daily living [15], and, thus, the inclusion of MS-specific PROMs measuring physical and psychological health could support the assessment of relapse severity. For instance, the MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29) has been used in clinical trials to evaluate recovery from relapses [15], and has been tested for remote administration [16]. Alternative scales could be considered depending on prevalent patients’ symptoms (e.g., mood, fatigue). However, in-person examination and/or MRI should be considered for cases where a relapse cannot be fully ruled out, in order to make timely treatment decisions [4].",
        "Overall, we have suggested a battery for MS assessment in tele-neurology, which strongly leverages patients’ empowerment and PROMs (Table 1). In particular, we recommend MS patients fill in the PDDS and the MSIS-29 before the tele-consultation, so that neurologists have a full view on the overall physical and psychological status. Then, during the tele-consultation, neurologists can focus on history taking and examination of brainstem function and other neurological systems, as required by patients’ symptoms. Finally, if necessary, the examiner could administer the oral version of the SDMT by showing the test form on patients’ screen. Alternatively, patients could be provided with PDDS, MSIS-29, and an electronic version of the SDMT [17], for self-assessment, and, then, request tele-neurology if necessary. The PDDS, the MSIS-29, and the SDMT could be integrated to video-consultation platforms or electronic health record systems, or be implemented using other online tools, such as Google Forms.",
        "Limitations of tele-neurology include the availability of technology to deliver tele-consultations (e.g., webcam quality, high-speed connection), which need to be accounted for by policymakers to avoid healthcare inequalities.",
        "In conclusion, though the medical management of COVID-19 is the current healthcare priority, chronic diseases should not be left unattended, and the use of common tools for neurological examination could improve tele-neurology practice, and quality of care for people with MS."

        "As our Geriatric Nursing anniversary year recognition continues, we are examining the topic of speech and language disorders in older adults during acute and critical illness and how attention to this topic has (or has not) changed in the past 40 years. In 1981, Geriatric Nursing published a classic, comprehensive overview of the assessment and treatment of speech and language disorders in older adults written by Barbara Dreher.1 “Overcoming Speech and Language Disorders”1 focused primarily on communication disorders resulting from stroke and laryngectomy. Several of the principles and interventions to improve communication presented in 1981 (e.g., modifying speaking and listening, maintaining quiet environment, and directions for the specific type of communication impairment) are still fundamental today in communication care for patients with stroke, and for a wide range of communication disabilities. Notably, the role of the speech language pathologist (SLP) in diagnosing and treating communication disorders was highlighted. Several communication tools such as communication boards with pictures, words, and letters and electronic voice synthesizers introduced in this article 40 years ago1 are still used for non-vocal patients in the acute care setting. We now have more advanced communication tools and nurse-led research testing the usability and efficacy of several of these tools.2\n",
        "Our understanding of the problems of communication disability, the conditions associated with impaired communication, and the health and safety risks of communication disability in the acute care of older adults increased tremendously over the past 40 years. Our view of communication disability expanded to include sensory impairments (i.e., poor vision or hearing) that affect receptive and expressive communication, limited English language proficiency, and poor health literacy. Similarly, attention to conditions beyond stroke that are associated with impaired communication include a host of neurocognitive (dementia) and neuromuscular (Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) disorders as well as situational conditions in acute and chronic critical illness (mechanical ventilation) that prevent vocal communication.",
        "Over the past 40 years, we witnessed advancements in hearing aid technology, and advocacy for hearing assessment and hearing aid access for older adults. However, less than 20-25% of persons who may benefit from hearing amplification devices or hearing aids own them, largely due to stigma, cost and access barriers.3 Hearing amplification and the availability of amplification technology for hospitalized older adults who are hard-of hearing is still widely variable in acute care hospitals despite Joint Commission standards mandating hospitals to accommodate communication disability.4 Experts recently called for increased attention to and enforcement of the Joint Commission standards specific to hearing amplification during acute care hospitalization.4\n",
        "Missed communication and misinterpretation are recognized as patient safety issues for hospitalized adults as evidence shows that persons with communication disabilities have greater risk for preventable adverse events during hospitalization.5 The inability to access nurse call systems due to paralysis or weakness contributes to missed communication and is another form of communication impairment often experienced by hospitalized older adults, yet overlooked in care improvement initiatives. Zubow and Hurtig6 reported that 33% of conscious patients in intensive care units are unable to use the conventional nurse call systems to initiate communication of basic needs.",
        "Our research and the work of colleagues in communication disorders science over the past four decades show that several common techniques that nurses rely on to communicate with nonvocal patients may contribute to misinterpretation of patient messages. For example, although many nurses rely on lip-reading to communicate with non-vocal patients, this technique requires formal training and is prone to misinterpretation.7 Nurses often assume that family members can interpret a patient's communication attempts during acute/critical illness, but family members report frustration and an inability to accurately interpret the patient's non-vocal messages.8 Communication impairment can affect symptom recognition by nurses and accurate pain assessment, in particular, can be problematic when patients have communication difficulty.9\n,\n10\n",
        "Multidisciplinary collaborations of communication disorders scientists, nurse researchers, and engineers led to improvements in low tech, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools (e.g., simple and complex communication boards, non-English language translations), clinician training in basic communication skills and AAC techniques, and electronic communication devices and tablet applications,2 including systems with nurse call features,11 for use in medical settings. A hospital chaplain developed and tested a novel spiritual care picture communication board, to support chaplain communication with non-vocal patients, showing an association between chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care and reductions in anxiety and stress during and after an ICU admission. 12 Many older adults prefer low tech AAC tools, but are still able and interested in using electronic tablet communication applications for medical encounters with appropriate demonstration and instruction.13 These studies and initiatives also highlight and extend the role of the speech language pathologist in providing instruction, consultation and support for complex communication needs of acute and critically ill older adults.14\n,\n15\n",
        "Unfortunately, although AAC tools and trainings directed at the communication needs of acute and critically ill adults improved over the past 40 years, dissemination, implementation and uptake are quite slow. Barriers to widespread availability and competence in the use of AAC tools and techniques in acute and critical care include competing priorities, lack of knowledge, perceived time commitment, and a general lack of programmatic ownership in many institutions for the provision of communication support. Our colleagues across the country continue to report a lack of training on how best to communicate with communication-impaired patients, unavailability of communication supplies at the bedside, and underutilization of inpatient SLP services for communication support consultations.",
        "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which disproportionately affects older adults in terms of severity and need for mechanical ventilation, sets an urgency to dissemination of communication materials and education and support for bedside providers.",
        "Tragically, due to the isolation precautions necessary to prevent the spread of this devastating infection, family members are not able to attend at the bedside of patients with COVID-19. These critically ill patients and their family members are not able to benefit from patient-family centered communication interventions that could help them make sense of and process the critical illness event.16 ICU clinicians are required to fill the void. They need access to simple communication tools to quickly and reliably interpret COVID-19 patients’ messages.",
        "In addition to being unable to communicate their needs and questions without voice, these mechanically ventilated patients may also have difficulty understanding instructions and messages from care providers who are wearing protective masks. A national group of experts created a suite of free communication tools, non-English translations, and tips https://www.patientprovidercommunication.org. The ‘case example’ tab provides exemplars of older adult patients with COVID19 to illustrate how speech language pathologists work with nurses to construct reliable methods to communicate with COVID-19 patients. They do this by observing from outside the isolation room, through iPad video connections, etc. The Ohio State University College of Nursing continuing education platform provides evidence-based communication training modules, brief demonstration videos, low-tech communication tools and a decision pathway for clinicians at https://go.osu.edu/speacs.",
        "In summary, we know what to do and have some great tools and resources to provide comprehensive communication support to older adults with communication disability during acute and critical care hospitalization. However, these resources (e.g., hearing amplification, communication boards, writing tools, electronic devices, and SLP consultation) are not standardized or readily available in many acute care hospitals. Moreover, most interprofessional teams are not trained in communication assessment and the use of assistive tools and techniques tailored to an individual patient's abilities and preferences. We hope that, in response to the enormous influx of older patients who need assistive communication during this pandemic, nurses and other members of the interprofessional team will access the free tools and training. Please submit your acute-critical care communication stories at https://www.facebook.com/groups/PatientProviderCommunication/ or email to Dr. Happ at happ.3@osu.edu."

        "Inevitably, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has inspired much discussion about the changed understanding of what states ought to do when responding to infectious disease outbreaks and the question of whether changed expectations have actually changed behaviour. The chair of the negotiations on the revision of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR), 1 Mary Whelan, expressed doubt that consensus on the revisionswhich codified these changed expectations -would have been possible without the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Whelan, 2008, p. 5) , implying that the consensus remained a fragile one and the likelihood of compliance limited. Therefore, to understand whether there are new shared expectations about the prompt reporting of disease outbreaks and the extent to which these expectations have altered state behaviour, we need to examine behaviour in the immediate post-SARS setting. The aftermath of an event such as SARS is the perfect time to examine whether that sense of urgency generated by the crisis can be utilized to achieve long-term behavioural change (Whelan, 2008) . David Heymann (2006, p. 352) has argued that this behavioural change is already evident: 'the detection of, and international response to, the SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that countries are willing to forgo the exclusive privilege of reporting and responding to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories in a manner over which they have supreme control'. He goes on to note that the East Asian response to Avian Influenza (AI), H5N1, which (re)appeared in December 2003 in poultry and went on to infect humans from 2004, 2 was indicative of a normative change where the duty to report prevailed over the financial and political costs of not doing so.",
        "This article examines Heymann's claims in more detail. Did East Asian states, affected by H5N1 human infections in the immediate aftermath of SARS, satisfy expectations about their duty to report disease outbreaks promptly and transparently? The H5N1 outbreak is particularly interesting given that it emerged at a time when states were formalizing these new responsibilities in the revised IHR, which were then under negotiation (2004) (2005) and that some states affected by H5N1 -China and Vietnam especially -were still recovering from SARS when this outbreak occurred. What is of particular interest is the alternative suggestion to Heymann (2006) , which is that some degree of 'rebalancing' and reassertion of sovereignty occurred in the context of H5N1 in response to the overt interference of the WHO in domestic responses during SARS (Calain, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Hoffman, 2010) .",
        "The article will proceed with a discussion of the post-SARS environment, and then examine how the International Relations (IR) literature has understood the events that followed during the H5N1 outbreak. I outline a common understanding that has emerged of the H5N1 outbreak, which suggests that East Asian states 'reverted to type' and reasserted their sovereignty by refusing to cooperate with disease reporting requirements. However, this interpretation is not based on an empirical assessment of how states actually behaved. To remedy this, I test the extent to which states engaged in 'frank and prompt reporting' (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) during the H5N1 outbreak. Doing so reveals that states did overwhelmingly meet this duty, even during the years when they were not legally bound to do so (which was not until the IHR revisions came into force in mid-2007) . I conclude that although sovereignty is undoubtedly an important influence on state behaviour, it need not be seen as antipathetic to states fulfilling their duty to report.",
        "The SARS outbreak, which emanated from South China in early 2003, has been identified as the trigger for inspiring states to accept these new duties to report disease outbreaks (Heymann and Rodier, 2004) . However, even during the SARS outbreak, there was evidence of shared expectations about prompt reporting that led to international demands that the Chinese government engage in open and transparent reporting behaviour with neighbouring states and the wider international community, which was not at that point prescribed by international law (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . According to David Fidler (2004, p. 116) , expectations that China should report a disease outbreak not covered by existing international conventions revealed that the WHO and the wider international community had 'begun to move beyond the state centrism of Westphalian public health'.",
        "However, even before SARS, states were progressively expecting new reporting behaviour. For instance, it has been argued that the WHO's response to SARS and states expectations during SARS were possible because of the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 54.14, agreed to in 2001 (Fidler, 2004, pp. 117-118) . WHA 54.14 (2001) was the first expression of an expectation that states had a duty to report outbreaks that could pose an international risk, and when they did not report an outbreak they expected the WHO to request for further information. This was dramatically new terrain for the WHO and for the states (Kamradt-Scott, 2010, p. 82), but the passing of this resolution arguably demonstrated states commitment to the concept even if the resolution itself was non-binding.",
        "There is no doubt that SARS acted as the crucial 'tipping point' that galvanized states to accept the need for a new standard of reporting behaviour (Davies, 2011, p. 435) . However, this could not have occurred without the WHO's earlier efforts to promote new behaviours in the field of disease reporting and states acceptance of this need in 2001. During the SARS outbreak, a critical mass of support for the duty to report was again reached during the 2003 WHA. WHA Resolution 56.28 (2003) was unanimously passed, calling for completion of the revised IHR (1969) framework and draft regulations to be in place and ready for adoption by May 2005 WHA meeting (Whelan, 2008, p. 6 ). In the same resolution, it was noted that the as yet unrevised IHRs were 'inadequate' and failed to include specific actions required of member states and the WHO (WHA 56.28, 2003) . Member states thus agreed that even before the adoption of the IHR revisions, they would 'establish immediately a national standing task force or equivalent group and, within it, to designate an official or officials having operational responsibilities and accessible at all times by telephone or electronic communication, to ensure the speed, particularly during emergencies of both reporting to the WHO and consultation with national authorities when urgent decisions must be made' (WHA 56.28, 2003: Paragraph 3[2] ).",
        "After SARS, the shared expectation that states would report openly and promptly was again reaffirmed. At the WHO Global Conference on SARS in June 2003, all states agreed that: 'Information should be communicated in a transparent, accurate and timely manner. SARS demonstrated the need for better risk communication as a component of outbreak control' (O'Malley et al, 2009, p. 614) . SARS was particularly exceptional because it exposed that a legal prescription for the duty to report was not the driving force required to change behaviour. SARS simply provided the 'critical mass moment' to turn that growing social expectation -states should report to each other openly and transparently -into prescribed practice (Davies 2011, p. 433) .",
        "But how should we understand the emergence of this duty to report and what impact it has had on state behaviour? Why would states agree to a behavioural expectation that may be politically or economically costly? One view is that the risk of not reporting has become more risky for the sovereign than to openly report. Price- Smith (2009, pp. 143, 149) notes that China -the country most recalcitrant in reporting the extent of their SARS cases -was also the country that paid the highest economic and political cost. In other words, self-interested behaviour can remain the dominant norm for the sovereign state -but what defines self-interest is not static -it too changes through interaction with the wider social environment (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, p. 912 ). As such, constructivists have argued contra the neo-utilitarian view of liberal and realist perspectives that the evident readiness of states to agree to shared rules that constrain their behaviour demonstrates the degree to which global governance frameworks shape state identity, function and roles. In other words, 'a core constructivist research concern is what happens before the neo-utilitarian model kicks in' (Ruggie, 1998, p. 867, emphasis added) . In the area of health, the IR focus has been how to explain why the increase in global frameworks to address health concerns that were traditionally under the (confident) management of the state (Zacher and Keefe, 2008, p. 20) . One explanation is that the 'transition of public health governance on infectious diseases [for example] from the traditional Westphalian framework to something new y highlights changes that may be occurring to the general structure and dynamics of international relations in the era of globalization' (Fidler, 2004, p. 8) . This age of post-Westphalian global health governance has seen states socialized into cooperating in global governance frameworks and come to view such cooperation as serving their interests whether by resolving problems that cannot be resolving unilaterally or by reducing transaction costs through cooperation (Fidler, 2004) .",
        "Under the leadership of the WHO Headquarters in the mid-late 1990s, initiatives such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria achieved political and donor support that was relatively unprecedented (Lee et al, 2002; Ricci, 2009) . From this perspective, the IHR revisions were just one of the several recent examples of states agreeing to sacrifice portions of their sovereign privileges by committing themselves to comply with international standard setting. SARS simply 'changed the calculus of the material interests of member states to reflect the threat that disease posed to their material interests, resulting in rapid innovation and change of the existing regime' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154 ).In the case of the IHR revisions, three of its revised demands that are especially significant for enshrining the duty to report over the core interest of state sovereignty (Mack, 2006, p. 366) are: (i) the duty of the state to notify the WHO within 24 hours of any emergency that may constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); 3 (ii) the duty to contain the outbreak at its source; and (iii) the obligation of national authorities to respond to the WHO's request for further information (WHA 58.3, 2005: Articles 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12; Mack, 2006) .",
        "Having briefly documented the emergence of the 'duty to report', the article now turns to examine the extent to which it has influenced the reporting behaviour of East Asian states affected by the H5N1 outbreak.",
        "The H5N1 AI outbreak was first identified in poultry in East Asia in December 2003. The first cases of human infection with H5N1 were in 2004, with nearly all cases of human infection resulting from direct contact with poultry. 4 The concern with H5N1 in the early days, which somewhat remains, is that H5N1 AI virus 'remains one of the influenza viruses with pandemic potential, because it continues to circulate widely in some poultry populations, most humans likely have no immunity to it, and it can cause severe disease and death in humans' (WHO, 2011a) .",
        "From 2003 to 2011, the highest cumulative total of human infections (and deaths) were (in order) in Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam (WHO, 2011b, see Table 1 ). The disease appeared to peak in 2006, when the highest number of human cases of infections appeared (most occurring in Indonesia). By 2010, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and China were the only countries to continue to experience human cases of infection (WHO, 2011b) .",
        "H5N1 was first identified in poultry in South Korea in December 2003. In the same month, Thailand raised the alarm when the H5N1 virus strain was discovered in sick tigers and leopards in the Bangkok Zoo, which was traced to infected poultry being fed to the animals as the cause of their infection. Retrospective analysis in 2006 revealed that the first possible H5N1 poultry The international politics of disease reporting and human cases emerged from China in November 2003 (WHO, 2011c). This case was most likely confused for a SARS case (Schnur, 2006) .",
        "In January 2004, Vietnam reported its first poultry outbreak of H5N1, followed in the same month by Japan, Hong Kong, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Indonesia's first report of poultry cases came in February 2004, at the same time as mainland China reported its first poultry cases (WHO, 2011c). In January, Vietnam reported its first H5N1 human case. By February, there were fears that the disease had already adapted to human transmission when a cluster of cases from one family was identified in Vietnam in February 2004 (WHO, 2011c). In the same month, Thailand reported its first two human infections (direct from poultry). By the end of 2004, Vietnam and Thailand confirmed six and five human infection cases, respectively. By 2005, Cambodia, China and Indonesia had confirmed cases of H5N1 human infections. By the end of 2005, Indonesia had the highest human case load of infections with 20 cases (WHO, 2011c). To get a sense of how serious the potential threat was, it is worth noting that the fatality rate for humans infected with H5N1 was 73 per cent in 2004, 63 per cent in 2005 and 43 per cent in 2006. Moreover, 90 per cent of the cases were in people under the age of 40 years (WHO, 2006) .",
        "At the outset of the H5N1 outbreak, there was no formal requirement for states to report and verify the disease because the revised IHR had not yet come into force (they did not do so until mid-2007). As the rate of infections The duty to report notwithstanding, there were several prima facie reasons to expect that states would not report H5N1 in a timely manner. First, states were not legally required to do so for the first three and a half years of the outbreak, as such governments might have been expected to comply only with their formal legal obligations (Lee and Fidler, 2007, p. 220) . Second, the financial costs associated with confirming H5N1 outbreak, especially the destruction of poultry stocks and associated farming livelihoods, posed a major deterrent to reporting (Scoones and Forster, 2010) . Third, these financial costs would also create additional political costs by devastating already vulnerable communities and placing intense pressure on governments to compensate and provide reassurances to save affected industries (Forster, 2010; Herington, 2010; Safman, 2010; Vu, 2010) . Despite these barriers, the literature has characterised the reporting behaviour of affected states as falling into one of the three categories: those that positively complied (Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia), those that did so more shakily (China, Thailand) and those that outwardly challenged the duty to report itself (Indonesia, Thailand). The general observation has been that the deterrents did not wholly inhibit reporting, but there were variations in how states understood their duty to report. Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia were generally viewed as being positive, and presented as evidence of states embracing the need to engage in the global health governance framework to ensure greater assistance in identifying and preventing the outbreaks (de Sa et al, 2010) . When inevitable delays in reporting was noted in these countries, it was reported as being due to capacity failures rather than direct political intent to deceive the international community or domestic audiences about the extent of the outbreak (Boltz et al, 2006; Ear, 2010; Herington, 2010; Coker et al, 2011) .",
        "At the same time, other states were criticized for their failure to adhere to the new duty to report, in particular prompt reporting and verification to the WHO of suspected outbreaks. In the second group, China's retrospective release of information in 2006-2007 for outbreaks in [2003] [2004] was met with some suspicion, with analysts asking whether these delays were the product of technical incapacity, bureaucratic difficulties or attempts at obfuscation (Chanlett-Avery et al, 2006, p. 10) . Thailand and Indonesia were regularly criticized for substantial lags in their initial reports of poultry and human cases, with it being revealed in both instances that the governments knew of the possible cause but delayed the release of laboratory findings (Butler, 2005; Butler, 2006; Sipress, 2009) . Thailand especially came under attack in the early stages of the outbreak.",
        "The presence of large poultry industries in Thailand was especially identified as the possible cause of initial secrecy (Forster, 2010; Safman, 2010) .",
        "However, the third behavioural category challenged the duty to report itself. Although the issue of virus sharing did not come under the auspices of the IHR (1969 or 2005 versions) , several analysts saw Indonesia's move as a broader bid to challenge its putative obligations under the revised IHR (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Smith, 2012) . Major concerns arose when Indonesia refused to share samples of the H5N1 virus from January 2007. Before this, it had been a long standing practice, as the creation of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) under the WHO's management in 1951, for states to share their influenza virus strains with all WHO collaborating laboratories (located in selected national laboratories) to allow them to assist with the production of vaccines and monitoring of virus strain mutation. Indonesia's refusal to share strains via the GISN raised concerns about the potential for states to assert 'viral sovereignty' as a way of reasserting themselves in the face of global health governance (Holbrooke and Garrett, 2008; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009 , pp. 1386 -1387 .",
        "The Indonesian Ministry of Health argued that it withheld the virus samples because virus sharing was unjust when the supplying country could not be guaranteed equitable access to vaccine and antiviral treatment from the developed countries that primarily manufactured these products on the basis of the viruses freely given (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Eighteen months later, in June 2008 (and a year after the IHR [2005] had come into force) then Indonesian Health Minister Dr Siti Fadilah Supari further questioned whether the government should even regularly report H5N1 human infections to the WHO (Branswell, 2008) . 5 Dr Supari's suggestion was seen as a significant challenge to the duty to report. However, in their written justification over the virus-sharing dispute, the Indonesian Ministry of Health did not refer to Dr Supari's comments regarding the IHR. The Ministry argued that their primary concern in terms of IHR reporting was the government's decision to conduct case confirmation within country rather than sending samples to a WHO collaborating laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Although the Ministry did apparently delay announcing some H5N1 human infections, particularly during 2009 where there are no details on such outbreaks on the WHO's Disease Outbreak News (DON) Website, the WHO Headquarters has continued to argue that it was promptly informed by the government of every outbreak during this period (Branswell, 2008 , Interview, 2011d . Indeed, the Indonesian government immediately supplied confirmation of two H5N1 human cases days after Dr Supari's comments (Reuters, 2008) . Nonetheless, Dr Supari's actions concerning virus samples and musings on the IHR gained support from other member states in the 'developed South' and particularly Asia sparking discussions about 'developing countries [being] increasingly suspicious' of the global health security initiative that inspired the IHR revisions (Aldis, 2008) . Moreover, although the Indonesian response during H5N1 was only one of three variants evident during the crisis, it is the one that has received most attention.",
        "The culmination of these events during the H5N1 outbreak, particularly instances of delayed reporting by China and Thailand, and the virus sharing challenge by Indonesia, prompted some analysts to question the post-Westphalian optimism expressed in the introduction and immediately after SARS. Indeed, this view has come to include some notable earlier advocates of the post-Westphalian era (Fidler, 2010b) . It has been suggested that the arrival of a 'post-Wesphalian era' has been 'overstated' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154) , and shared expectations around the duty to report may not be sufficient to induce states to change their behaviour and that powerful countervailing sovereign interests will likely override the perceived duty to report (Hoffman, 2010, pp. 514, 519) .",
        "Two principal sets of explanations were offered to explain this apparent backlash. The first concern was that the securitized rhetoric attached to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s had been accepted so readily that states were coming to view it as legitimate to (re)assert their sovereign right over their reporting behaviour, response and control of specimens. When disease outbreaks were associated with great economic costs -as was the case for Indonesia and other affected states -states were encouraged by securitization to respond through a security lens and privilege unilateral action over multilateral cooperation (Calain, 2007; Elbe, 2010; Forster, 2010 ; on costs see Coker et al, 2011) . As Stefan Elbe explained:",
        "As fear about the threat of a possible human H5N1 pandemic spread across the world, many governments scrambled to stockpile anti-viral medications and vaccines, albeit in a context where there was insufficient global supply to meet such a rapid surge in demand. Realizing that they were the likely 'losers' in this international race, some developing countries began to openly question the benefits of maintaining existing forms of international health cooperation. (Elbe, 2010, p. 476) The second explanation was that 'WHO illustrated during the SARS crisis what leadership in global health looks like in a post-Westphalian world', that H5N1 reaffirmed that this had the potential to not just be an anomaly, and that this had prompted some states to respond by protecting their sovereignty from what they now viewed as a sustained attack (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009, p. 1390) . According to this line of thinking, the assertion of 'viral sovereignty' during H5N1, predominantly led by Indonesia but with the tacit support of the region (Fidler, 2010a, p. 288) , could be understood as a statement (predictable perhaps as noted by Smith, 2012 ) that states could question their duty to report to the WHO in the manner proscribed and expected. It has also been argued that the significance of WHA resolutions has been overstated. For example, WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) only called for states to 'voluntarily' comply with the revised IHR in their response to H5N1; regardless of the phrase adopted, WHA resolutions are not legally binding resolutions (Irwin, 2010, p. 9 ). The Indonesian-led opposition may also be interpreted as an inevitable backlash against what many saw as the WHO overstepping its role in 2003 during the SARS crisis (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . From this perspective, the cooperation enjoyed during the SARS crisis was a product of exceptional circumstances and outside that context states would revert to type and seek to control outbreak news and manage their own response to outbreak events (Smith, 2010) .",
        "There are, however, at least three problems with these dominant understandings of how East Asian states responded to the H5N1 outbreak. First, adherents to this line of thinking need to explain why sovereignty concerns seemed to matter more for some states than for others. As I noted earlier, Indonesia and Thailand are assumed to be more protective of their sovereignty than both Cambodia and Vietnam. Given regional similarities in their dispensations towards sovereignty and the fact that the latter countries have been subjected to conflict and external aggression in the past few decades, the norm of sovereign non-interference alone cannot explain the variance in their behaviour (Vu, 2011) . Second, too much weight is given to Dr Supari's comments and there is little evidence to suggest that they were part of a more concerted push against the duty to report or other global health governance norms. Supari's (speculative) comments were offered once in an interview given only 1 year before she stepped down as Health Minister. Beyond this, there is no other prima facie evidence that Indonesia proved more resistant to promptly reporting H5N1 outbreaks to the WHO authorities. Third, and crucial for establishing the second point, claims about the sovereignty backlash are made in the absence of empirical evidence about what states actually did in terms of their reporting behaviour of H5N1 human infections from 2004 to 2010. Establishing the reporting behaviour of H5N1 affected states over a sustained period of time, rather than providing selective snapshots, will go a long way to establishing whether states have in fact modified their behaviour in line with shared expectations about the prompt reporting of diseases.",
        "This section examines the extent to which East Asian states complied with the duty to report by examining every report of H5N1 infection in the region between 2004 and 2010, noting not just official (government) confirmations of outbreaks, but the outbreak reports provided to the WHO by governments. Because of the variation in languages and different styles of reporting outbreaks via official Ministry of Health Websites (that is, some states report weekly or monthly, some report all immediate suspect outbreaks, some only report laboratory confirmed outbreaks), I examined the public communication of outbreak events by all states that recorded H5N1 human infections in the East Asian region between 2004 and 2010 via one disease monitoring website, ProMED Mail (PMM). 6 I then compared the reports for each case under PMM with the issuing of WHO alerts on the same outbreak that are usually released by the government for the WHO to then post on its DON site. 7 PMM is one of the oldest (created 1994) independent (non-state managed) publicly available International Surveillance and Response Programs, with a high correlation between its initial reports and event verification (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Hitchcock et al 2007) . It has strong moderator presence and access to subscribers who provide important insight into outbreak events that may have otherwise been overlooked if not for these 'insider informants' using PMM to communicate outbreak events (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Brownstein et al, 2008) . Although the moderated service of PMM means that there is the potential for a report to be discarded because of the moderator believing it not to be relevant, or for a disease outbreak to be missed because the system does not use a text mining tool (that sifts news media source providers such as FACTIVA), PMM has been widely acknowledged as often pre-empting WHO receipt of reports, and accurately reporting outbreak events confirmed by the WHO (Madoff and Woodall, 2005, pp. 725-727; Conway et al, 2010) . 8 Table 2 details how the reports were identified and the countries for which reports were collected. I compared reports of H5N1 human infections on PMM with WHO receipt of reports, over a 6-year time span to indicate how states actually behaved in relation to the putative reporting duties. Within the PMM reports I noted whether there was a high volume of 'informal' reports or 'rumours' being circulated about any particular outbreak that was not confirmed by the government. The number of rumours per year per country were so low that I did not include this data. In sum, PMM reports detected nearly all outbreak reports attracted government response. Although the WHO DON site does not report all outbreaks reported to Headquarters (Interview, 2011a), here we may observe whether there is a general trend of governments reporting outbreaks to the WHO and to what extent states sought to comply with this new duty to report.",
        "When the reporting behaviour was collated (see Figures 1-3) , it became clear that states were almost consistently maintaining the lead in reporting human outbreaks. Of particular interest, H5N1 reporting steadily increased after 2006, but just as crucially reporting rates to the WHO were highly correlated with official reports. This is of note considering that the IHR did not come into force until mid-2007, and as noted by others, prompt compliance with the IHR prompt reporting procedure was voluntary under WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) at this time (Irwin, 2010) .",
        "The core findings from my data set are threefold. First, Figure 1 demonstrates that the East Asian region had a steady reporting pattern that correlated closely with the number of cases in the region for that period, as shown in Figure 2 . In 2005 and 2006, the peak years for H5N1 human infection cases, affected governments were issuing regular updates of outbreaks. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the number of reports that the government were issuing and the confirmations by the WHO (which can only be publicly provided after receipt of government information). In 2005, there were only 10 official reports concerning outbreak events that were not published on the WHO Website -this is for all the three governments that had human infections that year (Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam). In 2006, there were only eight official reports released by the five governments that experienced outbreaks, which were not published on Vietnam. In addition, countries that did not have a case threshold of 5 or above were excluded (that is, Lao PDR, Myanmar); Cambodia was included due to regularly reporting for nearly all of the years examined. Finally, Bangladesh has reported human infection cases, but I have excluded them from this analysis due to case threshold. the WHO site. By 2008, the gap had narrowed to one official report that was either not sent on to the WHO, or the WHO opted not to publish on the DON site. Notably, in the light of the discussion in the previous section, this was in the same year that the Indonesian government -which accounts for the majority of cases in that year -discussed withholding reports. In sum, reports to the WHO were regular -both before the IHR coming into force and afterwards -and states always outpaced the WHO in their official reports of cases. There was only two instances (on 6 January 2005 and 16 June 2005) when the WHO reported on its DON site H5N1 outbreaks not yet confirmed by the state -Vietnam. Moreover, it appears that the mid-2007 date for when the IHR revisions came into force did not have any discernible effect on reporting, suggesting that the duty to report was in play before the IHR coming into formal effect. A second important finding is that those states critiqued for possible noncompliance with their duty to report -China, Indonesia and Thailand -were found to be reporting regularly. Of course, there are attendant questions surrounding the validity of the data and what it is actually telling us. Most notably, are states pre-empting media releases or controlling them (Davies, 2012) ? This is obviously very difficult to measure, but the possibility that reporting is largely controlled by the state should not be excluded. Nonetheless, it appears that the international attention attached to H5N1 cases led to a concerted effort by states to be seen as on the frontlines in response (Coker et al, 2011) .",
        "The third important finding was the variation of state reporting behaviour beyond the graphs shown here. There were several important inconsistencies. Whereas Cambodia, China and Thailand released official reports that closely correlated with the WHO's confirmation of received reports from these countries (variation was no more than one case difference), Indonesia and Vietnam showed variation at different times. Indonesia had a strong reporting relationship with the WHO during the early phase of the outbreak. From 2007, variation started to emerge. In 2007, 5 reports were not passed on to WHO (or not reported), in 2008 there were 3, in 2009 there were 4 and then in 2010 there were 4 government reports that were again not published on WHO site. Both the WHO Office in Indonesia (who reports cases to the WHO Headquarters) and the Indonesian Health Ministry have argued that these discrepancies between what the Indonesian government was reporting and WHO site was listing as confirmed outbreaks was a product of the WHO Headquarters being informed but choosing not to publish the information (Interview, 2011c). A less official line expressed in a separate interview was that the WHO Office staff in Indonesia, during the public dispute with Dr Supari from 2006-2009 and prior to her stepping down, were always promptly informed but requested from 2008 that the WHO Headquarters not immediately publish all outbreak events online (Interview, 2011d) . What is remarkable about this less official explanation is that the Indonesian Health Ministry officials still sought to inform the WHO of outbreaks (possibly without the Health Minister's permission), even during the height of the dispute, and the Ministry officials appeared to trust the WHO officials sufficiently to continue reporting information it did not want publicized.",
        "In the case of Vietnam, viewed as a 'positive' reporting case, the earlier phase of reporting from the government to the WHO was more sporadic -more than even at the height of the 'dispute' between Indonesia and the WHO. In 2005, the government reported 21 cases but the WHO issued only 12 reports. As noted earlier, two of these 12 reports were issued by the WHO without first confirming their existence from the government. From 2007 onwards, the correlation between the WHO and the government reports is almost identical, with only a difference of one case in some years. What is also very interesting about the Indonesia and Vietnam cases has been the strong emphasis in the literature that Indonesia's behaviour is a 'soverignty' or 'securitization' backlash; while Vietnam has been acquiesant. These findings reveal that even at the height of dispute between the WHO and Indonesian government reporting remained strong in comparison to the relationship between the WHO and Vietnam (viewed for the most part in positive terms). Despite significant differences between what Vietnam was obviously experiencing but not communicating to the WHO in the earlier years of the outbreak, there was little suspicion attached to this country's motivations. Whereas, the honesty of the Indonesian government was questioned, it seems, solely on the statements of the Health Minister in 2008. The lack of concern about Vietnam is all the more interesting given that the country's lack of freedom of the press means, in contrast with Indonesia's freer media structures, that there is little in the way of an informal reporting structure to keep the government 'accountable' (for example, Vu, 2010; Interview, 2011b; Davies 2012 ).",
        "In the aftermath of SARS and the IHR (2005) revisions, the WHO Headquarters argued in the 2007 World Health Report that 'in an electronically transparent world where outbreaks are particularly newsworthy events, their concealment is no longer a viable option for governments' (WHO, 2007, p. 13) . In relation to the H5N1 human-to-human infections, which began in late 2003, it was argued that early behaviour indicated that states were willing to confirm outbreak reports and even report outbreaks themselves to the WHO -indicating a high level of norm internalization (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) . However, the virus sharing disagreement between Indonesia and the WHO Headquarters, the comments of Dr Supari and then the variations in reporting time frames (Enemark, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Elbe, 2010; Fidler, 2010b; Smith, 2010; Smith, 2012) prompted concern that statements such as the above by the WHO in their 2007 World Report were overly optimistic.",
        "The question less explored in the literature is whether the normative expectation that states would report outbreaks promptly and transparently, as called for by the WHO, has actually been translated into behaviour. In this article, I have sought to show that for the case of H5N1 -notable for its immediacy post SARS and before the IHR revisions formally came into force -states in East Asia did appear to behave as if they believed themselves to be duty-bound to report promptly. Even those states that complained loudest about the WHO (Headquarters) assertiveness tended to report diseases regularly and promptly. When there were discrepancies (for example, Indonesia and Vietnam), they are minimal when their reporting pattern is viewed over the volume of cases across the six years. This section will now briefly examine how this compliance might be explained in the context of the post-Westphalian versus Westphalian argument.",
        "Constructivist IR theory has traditionally understood the process by which norms shapes behaviour as one of 'norm diffusion' involving 'adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea' (Acharya, 2004, p. 251) . However, as the field's critique of global health governance has noted, neither the East Asian region nor the international community appear to have bought wholesale into the idea that in every instance the IHR must be obeyed, especially if at the expense of other national interests (Katz and Fischer, 2010) . A more nuanced analysis is therefore called for. Amitav Acharya argues that when tracing normative change we should not just stop at the point that the norm is collectively accepted but should consider how the norm is 'localized'.",
        "According to Acharya (2009, p. 19) , norm localization 'does not extinguish the cognitive prior or identity of the norm-takers but leads to its mutual inflection with external norms. In constructivist perspectives on socialization, norm diffusion is the result of adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea. Localization, by contrast, describes a process in which external ideas are adapted to meet local practices'. The trajectory for localization, according to Acharya, progresses in four stages (Table 3) .",
        "What my findings have revealed is that given the conformity to the reporting norm during the H5N1 outbreak in East Asia, the duty to promptly report Table 3 : Trajectory of localization (based on Acharya, 2004, p. 251) Prelocalization",
        "Local actors may at first resist an external norm -either due to doubts of utility, adaptability or that it might undermine existing beliefs and practices. Therefore, it is vital that some aspect of the existing norm is found to have not adequately met 'new and unforeseen challenges'",
        "Local initiative At this stage, some local actors will start to borrow and frame the external norm to suit the local audience. Local actors must be 'willing and credible' -they cannot be seen as representing the wishes of an outside force Adaptation External norm will be 'reconstructed' to fit local beliefs and practices and likewise, local beliefs and practices will be adjusted to the behaviour required of the external norm Amplification Finally, there are new instruments and practices developed from the 'syncretic normative framework' -where local practices and influences are still visible, but the presence of the external norm is now visible disease outbreaks is best understood as being at the 'local initiative' stage where local actors are 'willing and credible' participants in the disease reporting framework but the process of adaptation and amplification are still nascent. Sovereignty has not been evoked to deny the duty to report nor has it led to states abrogating their perceived duty. Instead, East Asian states have demonstrated a strong interest in being seen as competent handlers of the outbreak, partly because of external funding attached to pandemic response and partly because of political interest in responding to an outbreak that was crippling poultry industries around the region (Coker et al, 2011) . Meanwhile, China was later commended for being remarkably cooperative in reporting H5N1 cases to the WHO, many think precisely because of its embarrassment after SARS (Interview, 2010; Interview, 2011a) . This is consistent with Acharya's local initiative stage where states are cognizant of local expectations regarding handling of outbreak events as much as they are of the international community's demands and norms (Harrington, 2010; Elbe, 2010) .",
        "However, as Figure 3 and my third point regarding state reporting behaviour above point out, there were inconsistencies. The question is whether these inconsistencies illustrate a failure to reconstruct the external norm, resulting in reassertions of sovereignty, or whether they were simply products of states interpreting the norm and adapting it to their context and circumstance (Davies, 2011) . For instance, Dr Supari's comments and actions regarding virus sharing did not alter the actual reporting relationship between the WHO Headquarters and Indonesian Health Ministry. Even though Figure 3 appears to show the Indonesian government not passing its reports on to the WHO, we know from reports that outbreak information was shared (Reuters, 2008) . Interviews with key stakeholders from the Indonesian government, the WHO Office in Jakarta and the WHO Headquarters (Interview, 2008; Interview, 2011a; Interview, 2011c; Interview, 2011d) 9 have confirmed that officials-level practice of reporting and verifying was not affected by the political debates about virus sharing and reporting. Political sensitivity amended how the reports were communicated, but the reporting relationship remained intact. The 'international' duty to report was amended to reflect local needs and priorities, but it was not breached. The same explanation has been expressed regarding earlier discrepancies between Vietnam's official reports and the WHO's reports of H5N1 (Interview, 2011b). Moreover, in the case of Vietnam and Indonesia, some delays in reporting appeared to be largely rooted in difficulty communicating outbreaks via decentralized health channels and poorly equipped laboratories outside of capitals (Forster, 2010; Vu, 2010) . It is of note that IR appreciations of the H5N1 case have emphasized sovereign obfuscation over sovereign capacity to meet the duty to report for explaining state behaviour during H5N1 (Davies, 2011) .",
        "Do these findings suggest that the post-Westphalians were right all along? Not yet. While the graphs demonstrate that the desire to internalize the norm to report promptly and openly is evident in the region, if we understand Archya's argument concerning how norms are localized -particularly in the Asian context -there are crucial adaption and syncretic hurdles to be jumped. In other words, the way in which this duty is interpreted and implemented will depend on how it is affected by resource constraints, political systems, political instabilities, natural disasters and crises, and other cherished principles. All of this creates the potential for backtracking when circumstances persuade states that non-compliance would serve them better than compliance. These circumstances were apparent during the course of the H5N1 outbreak but more often than not the duty to report was fulfilled, if imperfectly.",
        "The H5N1 crisis showed that states acted as if they had a duty to promptly report disease outbreaks. Sovereignty was not employed as an excuse to avoid compliance by failing to report. As noted by one health official, 'we are a competitive group in ASEAN, if we can't be seen to be doing the right thing in front of our neighbours y that is worse than anything WHO can say' (Interview, 2011e). Amitav Acharya (2009, p. 5) has noted in the case of Asia, 'new international norms do not enter into a local normative vacuum'. Sometimes new norms can amplify local norms or be made to fit local norms with some form of normative compromise. This normative compromise is evident in the region in relation to the duty to report. Of course, in East Asia, sovereignty and non-interference remain sacrosanct, but the way in which these principles are understood is changing to permit some degree of sovereign responsibility (Bellamy and Davies, 2009 ). Moreover, sovereignty and noninterference have never meant that member states do not need to be aware of the impact of their domestic political actions on each other (Acharya, 2009) .",
        "The response to H5N1 may therefore have been as much about responding to regional demands for notification as it was to responding to the WHO's demands. One example of this that is having great success in the region but receives little discussion within IR circles has been the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) that is now in its second phase (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The purpose of APSED, which includes member states to the WHO South East Asia Regional Office and the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, with the engagement of the ASEAN Secretariat, is to promote regional understandings and interpretation of the IHR revisions, regional understandings of how responsible states engage in disease outbreak surveillance, response and communication (Li and Kasai, 2011) .",
        "In sum, claims that there has been a sovereignty backlash against the duty to report diseases and that this is forestalling progress on global health governance only reflect part of the picture. Of course, sovereignty and politics play important roles but it is important to understand the extent to which behaviour is actually shaped and to do so on the basis of empirical evidence of what that behaviour actually is. Evidence from H5N1 suggests that concerns notwithstanding East Asian states do behave as if they believe themselves to have a duty to report. The source of this change is most probably a combination of global norms, institutional standard setting, self-interest and -importantlyregional peer pressure.",
        "human-to-human transfer cluster (eight cases, seven deaths) and has been linked to the first dispute between the WHO and the Indonesian government regarding release of the virus sequence data (Roos, 2008; Sipress, 2009, pp. 38, 126) 5 Dr Supari was reported as questioning whether the 24-hour requirement of the IHR (2005) was necessary and that she would prefer to provide reports every 6 months (Branswell, 2008) . 6 www.promedmail.org/ 7 www.who.int/csr/don/en/ 8 PMM reporting accuracy has been measured at 91 per cent (Freifeld et al, 2008, p. 150) . 9 Citations are in not order of who was interviewed."

        "\nHuman serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the body.Human serum albumin represents the most important antioxidant agent in the human plasma.Human serum albumin is the main depot for nitric oxide transport in the blood.Human serum albumin plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of vascular barrier and endothelial glycocalyx.Human serum albumin is successfully used in many settings of perioperative medicine.\n",
        "Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in the human plasma (40–50 g/L). HSA has many functions; it is the main regulator of the vascular barrier, antioxidant in the plasma, and transporter of nitric oxide (NO) and fatty acids and drugs.",
        "HSA infusions have been used successfully for more than 50 years since World War II in many perioperative settings such as shock, volume expansion, burns, cardiopulmonary bypass, acute liver failure, sepsis, and many more. Recently, its use has been questioned following a widely publicized meta-analysis in 1998 that reported increased mortality in patients who received albumin solutions; the role of albumin administration in critically ill patients became highly controversial. However, the results of this meta-analysis have been challenged by several meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials that not only proved the safety of HSA but its benefit especially in patients with sepsis, liver failure, hypoalbuminemia, and burns [1–4]. The most recent evidence-based functions and uses of HSA in the perioperative settings are reviewed in this chapter.",
        "Human serum albumin (HSA) is a non-glycosylated, negatively charged plasma protein. HSA is a single polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 66.5 KDa. HSA consists of α(alpha)-helix but no β(beta)-sheet, and it consists of three homologous domains (I–III) that assemble to form a heart-shaped molecule. Each domain is composed of two subdomains (A & B) with distinct helical folding patterns connected by flexible loops. The center of the molecule is made up of hydrophobic radicals, which are binding sites for many ligands, while the outer part of the molecule is composed of hydrophilic ligands (Fig. 9.1) [5].\n",
        "HSA is a member of the albumin superfamily, which also includes α(alpha)-fetoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein, and afamin (α[alpha]albumin). HSA synthesis is governed by a single copy gene lying on the long arm of chromosome 4, near the centromere for the long arm, at position 4q11-13. The mRNA for HSA encodes a precursor protein (preproalbumin) of 609 amino acid residues. Cleavage of the single peptide of 18 residues and the propeptide (proalbumin) of six residues yields the mature protein of 585 residues [6].",
        "HSA plays an integral role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA enhances the integrity by electrostatic binding to the negatively charged heparin sulfate side chains of core glycoproteins such as syndecan-1 and glypican-1 of the endothelial glycocalyx via its positively charged arginine residues and enhances the availability of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by red blood cells (RBCs). Extracellular sphingosine is taken up and phosphorylated by RBCs sphingosine kinases (SK) into S1P that is stored in the cell membrane of RBC. S1P is extracted from the RBC membrane by Apo lipoprotein M (ApoM) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Apo lipoprotein M is the principal partner of S1P in HDL) and HSA, and this ensures a constant supply of receptor-available S1P for cellular signaling purposes. In contrast to the bond formed between S1P and HDL, HSA facilitates the solubility of S1P in the aqueous solution but not in physical bond to HSA. This unbound S1P is the active form of S1P. It is worth mentioning that one S1P molecule is extracted by 500 serum albumin molecules, indicating that HSA does not physically bind S1P [7–9]. S1P activates the G protein-coupled S1P1 receptor, which rapidly activates the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 in the endothelial cells, leading to peripheral localization of cytoskeletal effectors (cortactin and nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase). This localization promotes adherents’ junction (including vascular endothelial-cadherin and associated catenins) and tight junction (occluding, zonula occludens proteins and claudins) formation. Therefore, S1P improves the vascular barrier and stabilizes the endothelial glycocalyx. S1P has been found to reduce matrix metalloproteinase activation, thereby attenuating the loss of endothelial cell surface glycocalyx components. Both actions appear to involve signaling via the S1P receptor [10].",
        "Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance leading to damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. According to Halliwell and Whiteman, an antioxidant is a substance that, when present at low concentrations compared with those of an oxidizable substrate, significantly delays or prevents oxidation of that substrate [11]. Human serum albumin represents a major antioxidant agent in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of HAS results from the redox properties of the Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) and from metal-binding abilities. Among the metal ligands, copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are very important, as they are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) after a reaction with oxygen. Free Cu (I) and Fe (II) ions can react with H2O2 leading to the formation of the deleterious hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Cu(I) and Fe(II) binding to HSA promotes their oxidation to Cu(II) and Fe (III), thereby limiting their ability to participate in Fenton reaction. Copper ions bind to HSA with high affinity at the N-terminal tripeptide Asp-Ala-His. The first four amino acids of the N-terminus of HSA, Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK), form a tight binding site for Cu(II) ions. DAHK/Cu has a superoxide dismutase activity, which thereby reduces the ROS generation. By trapping Cu(II), HSA prevents low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid peroxidation. Moreover, HSA and the tetrapeptide (DAHK) were shown to prevent neuronal death in murine cell cultures exposed to oxidative stress generated by H2O2/Cu(I)/ascorbic acid reagent [12]. Therefore, the binding of Cu ions with albumin is considered one of the most important antioxidant functions of albumin as Cu can react with H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals 60 times faster than Fe.",
        "HSA is important for heme-Fe scavenging, providing protection against free heme-Fe oxidative damage. During the first seconds after heme-Fe appearance in plasma, more than 80 % of this powerful oxidizer binds to HDL and LDL, and only the remaining 20 % binds to HSA and hemopexin (HPX). Then, HSA and HPX remove most of the heme-Fe from HDL and LDL. Afterward, heme-Fe transits from HSA to HPX, which releases it into hepatic parenchymal cells after internalization of the HPX-heme-Fe complex by CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. It should be mentioned that kinetics of heme-Fe transfer from HDL and LDL to HSA and HPX is faster than the heme-Fe-induced lipoprotein oxidation [13, 14].",
        "Albumin-bound bilirubin confers an antioxidant effect by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Bilirubin bound to albumin was shown to protect α(alpha)-tocopherol from damage mediated by peroxyl radicals and to prolong the survival of human ventricular myocytes against in situ–generated oxidative stress [15, 16]. Cholesterol undergoes oxidation in vitro and in vivo, forming biologically active derivatives known as oxysterols. Oxysterols bind to albumin with high affinity. Oxysterols carried by albumin are less rapidly released to cells than cholesterol. By this, albumin could limit detrimental effects of oxysterols on cells. Furthermore, binding homocysteine by HSA protects from atherosclerosis as elevated plasma homocysteine is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) [17].\n\n",
        "Physiologically, HAS exists predominately in a reduced form (i.e., with free thiol, HSA-SH) and is known as mercapto-albumin. However, a small but significant proportion of albumin pool exists as mixed disulfides (HSA-S-S-R); where R represents low-molecular-weight, thiol-containing substances in plasma – chiefly cysteine and glutathione [18]. Mixed disulfide formation increases as part of the aging process and during disease processes characterized by oxidative stress that enhances endothelial cell damage through oxidative stress and increase in apoptosis levels. Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) represents the largest fraction of free thiol in human plasma, HAS being the most abundant protein in plasma. Cys34 is located at the surface of HAS, close to Aspartate 38 (Asp38), Histidine 39 (His39), and Tyrosine 84 (Tyr 84). These three residues affect the ionization state of Cys34, thus modulating its reactivity [13]. In healthy adults, about 70–80 % of the Cys34 in albumin contains a free sulfhydryl group, whereas about 25–30 % of the HSA molecules have Cys34 forming a mixed disulfide with either cysteine or homocysteine or glutathione, thus affecting the Cys34 redox potential. Oxidation of Cys34 leads to the formation of sulfenic acid (RSOH), which is further oxidized to sulfinic (RSO2 H) or sulfonic acid form (RSO3 H). Sulfenic acid constitutes a central intermediate in both the reversible and irreversible redox modulation by reactive species. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) constitute nitrogen-centered species analogous to ROS. RNS such as nitric acid (NO) contribute to various biological processes. HSA acts as a NO depot and a NO transducer. Moreover, 82 % of NO in blood (~7 μ[mu] M) is transported as an S-nitrosothiol bound at the HSA residue Cys34. S-nitrosylated HSA may represent a circulating endogenous reservoir of NO and may act as an NO donor. S-nitrosylated HSA acts primarily as a vasodilator in vivo and represents a stable reservoir of NO that can be released when the concentrations of low-molecular-weight thiols are elevated [19]. S-nitrosylated HSA has been shown to reduce either ischemia or reperfusion injury in pig and rabbit hearts after unprotected warm ischemia through long-lasting release of NO [13]. Other RNS, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−), constitute powerful oxidants and nitrating species [20]. The -SH group of albumin represents an important antioxidant against peroxynitrite as the thiol group was oxidized to a sulfenic acid (HSA-SOH). Subsequently, HSA-SOH can be converted to a disulfide and then back to mercapto-albumin (HSA-SH). HSA administration favorably influences plasma thiol-dependent antioxidant status, as well as levels of protein oxidative damage in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21, 22]. Moreover, HSA is able to scavenge strongly oxidant compounds such as hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypothiocyanous acid. Cys34 is oxidized preferentially by hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acid with the corresponding sulfenyl derivative. HSA is able to scavenge HOCI, preventing alteration of its preferential biological target α(alpha)1-antiprotease [23]. Interestingly, West Nile virus is neutralized by hypochlorous acid-modified HSA that binds to domain III of the viral envelope protein E [24].",
        "During its long life (~3 weeks), an HSA molecule makes 15,000 passes through the circulation, incurring some damages that affect its ligand-binding and antioxidant properties. Diabetes mellitus is one of the main pathological conditions that impairs the antioxidant functions of albumin. In this disease, albumin undergoes increased glycation. The level of glycated HSA in normal humans is about 10 %, and increased to 20–30 % in hyperglycemic patients. Glycation corresponds to the nonenzymatic attachment of glucose molecule to a free amine residue. HSA glycation is associated with oxidation of His and Trp residues, main chain fragmentation, and loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. Both the use of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin reduces the levels of advanced glycation [25]. The glycation of HSA impairs its antioxidant activity and its copper-binding ability. Glycation of HSA induced a marked loss of its antioxidant activity to copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, probably by the generation of superoxide. Moreover, the Fe(III)-binding antioxidant capacity of HSA is markedly reduced in diabetic patients. Finally, the HSA transport of tryptophan (Trp), which is the largest and essential amino acid, is reduced after its glycation. HSA glycation alters the binding of endogenous and exogenous ligands; in particular, glycation of Lys 199 enhances warfarin binding, but decreases bilirubin affinity [13].",
        "Several receptors for advanced glycation end products initiate intracellular signaling and enhance ROS formation in the cells through recognition and binding of glycated (macro) molecules including HSA. Moreover, hypochlorous acid-mediated carbonylation of Lys residues of glycated HSA represents a major antigenic advanced glycation end product in hyperglycemia and in inflammation [26]. Glycated albumin was shown to impair vascular endothelial NO synthase activity in vivo in aortas of rabbits [27]. Glycated HSA displays a toxic effect on microglial cells associated with impairments in cellular proteolytic systems, possibly reflecting the role of advanced glycation end products in neurodegenation.",
        "HSA may protect other proteins including hemoglobin, insulin, and immunoglobin from glycation in the early stages of diabetes due to its long half-life and its high concentrations compared to other proteins [28]. The irreversible damages associated with diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and coronary artery disease could be attributed to reduced antioxidant properties of glycated HSA.",
        "Alterations in antioxidant properties of HSA were very recently identified in vivo in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This reflects the impaired antioxidant HSA activity, which is associated with the enhanced glycation level of HSA in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. That might have increased the perioperative risks in those patients [29].",
        "HSA has anticoagulant and antithrombotic functions. These functions may in part be mediated by the HSA capacity to bind NO forming S-nitrosothiols, thereby inhibiting the rapid inactivation of NO and allowing prolongation of its anti-aggregatory effects on platelets [30]. Therefore, the use of HSA might be very beneficial in cases with hypercoagulable conditions such as during the perioperative period.",
        "The interaction between HSA and another molecule results in enzymatic activity. This property of HSA is called an enzyme-like or a pseudo-enzymatic activity. The esterase activity involving lysine (Lys) 199 is able to split acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) into salicylic acid, which is released and the acetyl group is transferred to especially Lys 199. Therefore, aspirin but not other salicylates induce the aspirin resistance syndrome, as the acetylation of albumin molecule can be allergic. Asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps characterize aspirin resistance syndrome. Moreover, Lys 199 and penicillins can covalently bind via an aminolysis, generating a penicilloyl-containing peptide. The covalent labeling of Lys 199 can have clinical consequences. The penicilloyl-HSA complex has no antibacterial activity; however, it represents the major antigenic determinant of penicillin allergy. HSA acts as a phosphotriesterase activity, which thereby inactivates organophosphorus compounds. HSA can catalyze RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage; therefore, it participates in the degradation of endogenous extracellular RNA and of circulating pathogenic nucleic acids. HSA possesses enolase activity toward dihydrotestosterone, converting it from the 3-keto to the 3-enol form. In addition, HSA facilitates the isomerization and the stereoselective hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates and the removal of glucuronide conjugates, thereby reducing their plasma levels by reversible and/or irreversible binding. Finally, HSA seems to have a significant role in both the biosynthesis and the elimination the prostaglandins. HSA has no enzymatic effects on leukotrienes or thromboxanes. However, it binds and thereby stabilizes thromboxane A2. Binding could play a major role for the inactivation of these potent compounds, diminishing the biological activities of substances that may be harmful for the body if present in too large amounts [6, 13].",
        "Hypoalbuminemia is generally defined as serum albumin concentration ≤30 g/L and is usually very common in critically ill patients. The albuminemia could result from increased loss of HSA into the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and reduced hepatic synthesis of HSA caused by cytokines and stress of critical illness.",
        "Hypoalbuminemia is considered an independent risk factor for worse outcomes in critically ill patients. HSA levels <20 g/L were associated with higher mortality risk in burn patients with 84 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity [31]. In surgical septic patients, every 1 g/L decrease in albumin below 23 g/L was associated with a 19.4 % increase in hospital mortality and 28.7 % increase in the incidence of multiple organ failure [32]. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/L in serum albumin was associated with a 137 % increase in morbidity, and a 71 % increase in length of hospital stay [33]. Preoperative low serum albumin (<4.0 g/dl) was shown to be an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) following off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB). AKI was associated with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital and a high mortality rate [34].",
        "HSA circulates from the blood across the capillary wall into the interstitial compartments, including cerebrospinal fluid, and returns to the blood through the lymphatic system with a circulation half-life of approximately 16 h. The movement of HSA across the capillary wall is defined as the transcapillary escape rate (5 % per hour), which indicates the percentage of intravascular HSA leaving the intravascular compartment per hour [13]. In its long half-life of ~2–3 weeks, 1 HSA molecule could make about 15,000 passes through the circulation. HSA is mainly synthesized in the liver. In healthy young adults, about 12–25 g of HSA per day is synthesized in polysomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. HSA is not stored hepatically and there is therefore no reserve for release on demand [30]. Under physiological circumstances, only 20–30 % of hepatocytes produce HSA and its synthesis can be increased up to 200–300 % on demand. HSA synthesis is regulated by colloid osmotic pressure and the osmolality of the interstitial liquid around the hepatocytes. Insulin plays an important role in stimulating HSA synthesis; therefore, diabetic patients could suffer hypoalbuminemia. Estrogens do not affect HSA transcription, but act by modifying the stability of the HSA mRNA. HSA synthesis can be enhanced by corticosteroids, insulin, and amino acids administration. HSA synthesis can be rate-limited by amino acid deficiencies, but these are rarely seen clinically, except in states of extreme starvation and malnutrition [30]. In acute-phase reactions, such as in trauma and the perioperative period, the synthesis of HSA is depressed by hepatic cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α(alpha).",
        "Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin, despite their disparate forms and functions, have long been known to share two unique characteristics, namely, their lengthy life spans and inverse relationship between their serum concentrations and half-lives. The long half-lives are attributed to the efficient receptor-mediated recycling pathway involving the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is a heterodimer of a nonclassical major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) α(alpha)-chain and β(beta)2 microglobulin (β[beta]2m) that binds the two abundant serum proteins IgG and albumin in the body. FcRn binds both IgG and albumin simultaneously on the opposite sides of the receptor, where the net transport can be basolateral to apical, apical to basolateral, or apical to apical (endothelial cells). FcRn interacts with IgG and albumin in a strictly pH-dependent manner; therefore, it binds them at acidic pH and not at physiological pH. Pinocytosed IgG and albumin bound by the receptor within acidified endosomes are transported back to the cell surface where physiological pH of the blood triggers release of the ligands into the blood circulation. The intracellular nonbound fractions are targeted for lysosomal degradation. FcRn is also largely responsible for transporting the IgG across the placenta whereby the IgG concentration in newborns at term normally exceeds that of the mother. Animals deficient in FcRn catabolize IgG and albumin more rapidly than normal animals and manifest low plasma concentrations of both molecules. Familial hypercatabolic hyoproteinemia, where deficiency of FcRn is due to mutation in β (beta) 2m results in hypercatabolism and low plasma concentrations of both albumin and IgG. However, patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) exhibit plasma deficiency only in IgG but not albumin caused by reduced affinity of FcRn to IgG [35–37].",
        "The catabolism of HSA takes place in several organs at a rate of about 14 g per day in a 70 kg healthy adult, or 4 % of whole body protein turnover. The rate of HAS catabolism is increased by protein and caloric deprivation as HSA is used as a source of energy. The mechanism of HSA breakdown involves protein uptake into endocytotic vesicles, which fuse with lysosomes of endothelial cells.",
        "Circulating HSA is also lost into the intestinal tract (about 1 g each day), where digestion releases amino acids and peptides that are reabsorbed. There is minimal urinary loss of HSA in healthy subjects. It is worth mentioning that of the 70 kg of HSA that passes through the kidneys each day, only a few milligrams are secreted from kidney tubules [13].",
        "The use of human albumin in critically ill and septic patients has been through much controversy in the last two decades. In 1998, a Cochrane meta-analysis for albumin administration in critically ill patients was published in the British Medical Journal [38]. The average sample size of the selected 32 studies in this meta-analysis was just 46 patients. The results of this meta-analysis showed increased mortality of almost 70 % in patients given albumin. The results of this Cochrane report changed the practice rapidly around the world with dramatic reduction in albumin use especially in Europe. The validity of this meta-analysis has been disputed for several methodological reasons, such as omission of relevant trials, small trials bias, and combination of heterogeneous trials, which included adults and high-risk neonates, inadequate assessment of the effect of methodological quality on outcome, and the absence of a plausible mechanism to explain albumin-associated excess mortality [39, 40]. Moreover, the meta-analysis did not include burns trials in which the mortality rate was lower in albumin [41]. Finally, the crossover pattern in which the most seriously ill patients in the control group were switched to albumin as a rescue measure, therefore, would bias the pooled estimates of relative risk in favor of the control group [40]. Only a few years later, this meta-analysis was followed by an updated meta-analysis, in which 55 trials involving 3,504 randomly assigned patients had been included and 525 deaths occurred [40]. Pooled relative risk estimates among trials with blinding and those with 100 or more patients were 0.73 (CI, 0.48–1.12) and 0.94 (CI 0.77–1.14), respectively. The relative risk was also consistently less than 1.0 for trials that had two or more of the four attributes indicating higher methodological quality such as blinding, mortality as an endpoint, no crossover, and 100 or more patients. These observations suggest that albumin therapy reduces mortality. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis supported the safety of albumin use in critically ill patients. In 2004, the results of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) randomized control trial (RCT) in 7,000 critically ill patients were published, showing that a 4 % albumin solution was as safe as normal saline as resuscitative fluid in critically ill patients [42]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the SAFE study showed benefit of using albumin in patients with severe sepsis, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death of 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.52–0.97; P = 0.03) for albumin compared with saline. Therefore, the authors concluded that administration of albumin compared to saline did not impair renal function or organ function and may have decreased the risk of death in patients with severe sepsis [1].",
        "Moreover, Guidet and colleagues assessed the cost-effectiveness of albumin, as given in the SAFE study on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, who were admitted to 1 of 35 French ICUs. Based on a presumed 4.6 % reduction in mortality associated with albumin therapy as shown in the SAFE trial, 513 lives were saved among the 11,137 patients included, with an estimated life expectancy for each life saved of 9.8 years. Therefore, the authors suggested that albumin administration was a cost-effective intervention in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [4].",
        "In a subsequent meta-analysis that included 17 studies with randomized 1,977 participants, there were eight studies that included only patients with sepsis and where patients were a subgroup of the study population. The use of albumin for resuscitation of patients with sepsis was associated with a reduced mortality, with the odds ratio of 0.82 % (CI 95 % 0.67–1.0, P = .047) [1]. Caironi and colleagues randomized 1,818 patients with severe sepsis in 100 ICUs to receive either 20 % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a higher mean arterial pressure and lower net fluid balance (P < 0.001). At 28 days the mortality rate was 31.8 % in the albumin group and 32.0 % in the crystalloid group. At 90 days the mortality rate was 41.1 % in the albumin group and 43.6 % in the crystalloid group. However, there was improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock (1,121 patients; 90-day mortality, 43.6 % in the albumin group vs. 49.9 % in the crystalloid group; relative risk 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.77–0.99; P = 0.03) [43]. The results of a recent meta-analysis, which included 14 studies (18,916 patients with sepsis), showed that resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis seems to be associated with reduced mortality [44]. Furthermore, the improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, 3,658 with severe sepsis and 2,180 with septic shock patients were included in the analysis [45]. Compared with crystalloid, a trend toward reduced 90-day mortality was observed in severe sepsis patients resuscitated with albumin (OR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.76–1.01; P = 0.08). However, in septic shock patients the use of albumin for resuscitation significantly decreased 90-day mortality (OR 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.67–0.97; P = 0.03) [45].",
        "Albumin resuscitation in sepsis has a unique feature compared to crystalloid as its effectiveness as a plasma-volume expander does not change in pathophysiological conditions associated with increased microvascular permeability as sepsis. In addition, in severe sepsis the ratio of albumin to crystalloid for equal plasma volume expansion is approximately 1–4.5 [46]. The use of intravenous albumin in addition to antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis reduced the incidence of renal impairment, death, and paracentesis-induced circulatory collapse in comparison with treatment with an antibiotic alone [47, 48]. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of albumin improved oxygenation but did not affect mortality [49].",
        "The only exception for the benefit of using albumin in patients with sepsis was shown in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial as evidenced in increasing mortality with the use of albumin and saline boluses compared to no bolus (control group) in pediatric patients infected with malaria in eastern African countries. The bolus-therapy-induced hypervolemia by albumin and saline boluses in those patients could explain the increased mortality in this study compared to control group [50].",
        "Human serum albumin is a unique pleiotropic protein with neuroprotective properties. Rats received 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and were treated with human albumin or saline after 30 min of recirculation. The cortical blood vessels were examined afterward by laser-Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI). Albumin therapy resulted in significant increases in arteriolar diameter, and reversing stagnation, thrombosis, and corpuscular adherence within cortical venules in the reperfusion phase after focal ischemia [51]. In a rat model of acute ischemic stroke induced by MCAO, rats received 1.25 g/kg intravenously at 2, 3, 4, or 5 h after onset of MCAO. Albumin therapy markedly improved neurological function, and reduced infarction volume and brain swelling [51]. The neuroprotective effects of albumin have been confirmed in a study with permanent MCAO in rats, where albumin treatment led to 48 % increases in cortical perfusion (P < 0.002), but saline in the control group caused no change [51].",
        "Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess the albumin treatment during stroke recovery in rats. Albumin treatment was associated with restoration of fMRI response magnitudes and temporal profiles [52]. Rats underwent subarachnoid hemorrhage by endovascular perforation. Albumin of either 0.63 or 1.25 g/kg was injected immediately after the surgery. Albumin at low-to-moderate doses markedly improves long-term neurobehavioral sequelae after subarachnoid hemorrhage [53].",
        "There are only two large published trials for the use of albumin after acute ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), 422 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 % albumin (2 g [8 ml] per kg; maximum 750 ml) and 419 to receive an equivalent volume of isotonic saline. The primary outcome was favorable, defined as either a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1, or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, or both, at 90 days. The rate of favorable outcome did not differ between the groups. However, the patients in the albumin group had more mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [54]. The reason for the negative outcome of this well-designed study was the high dose of albumin given as a single bolus, which might have induced those unfavorable effects and obscured the neuroprotective effect of albumin.",
        "Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days was tolerated by the patients with SAH without major complications and may be neuroprotective. Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days had lower rates of cerebral vasospasm measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and cerebral infarctions. The main physiological effects of albumin treatment were elevation of the serum albumin concentration and mean arterial blood pressure. In addition, serum albumin remained elevated 7 days after treatment, which might be beneficial throughout the critical period of DCI [55, 56].",
        "The mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of albumin could be explained by its ability to attenuate brain edema and inhibit the endothelia cell apoptosis [57, 58]. Albumin administration may improve microcirculatory blood flow, increase organ perfusion, decrease leukocyte rolling and adherence, and reduce the inflammatory response [59]. Albumin preserves the blood brain barrier (BBB) by abolishing the hyperactivation of metalloproteinases −2 and −9 (MMP-2/9) following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting MMP-2 and MMP-9 are key mediators for the albumin-induced neurovascular protection [53]. Moreover, albumin is considered the major antioxidant agent in the body. Albumin functions as an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) reservoir via binding of its sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine 34 residue with NO to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). It is worth mentioning that 82 % of NO in blood is preserved in stable form as RSNO [13]. Therefore, albumin is able to neutralize the excessive circulating NO so as to prevent the nitro-oxidative stress and, on the other hand, to continue to release NO when the concentrations of low-molecular thiols are elevated. Thereby, albumin via RSNO-adducted NO can relax blood vessels, inhibit platelet aggregation, and increase aortic blood flow [53].",
        "In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline, most probably because the hypo-osmolar (4 %) albumin solution with mean measured osmolarity of 266 (266–267) mOsm/kg H2O used in the study induced increases in intracranial pressure but not the use of albumin per se [60, 61]. However, the use of 4 and 20 % solutions in 93 patients with severe TBI and Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8 in addition to a neutral or to a slightly negative fluid balance was associated with low mortality in those patients [62]. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be hypo-osmolar solutions should not be used in patients with TBI [63].",
        "The activation of systemic inflammatory and hemostatic systems that takes place during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) results in fibrin formation, platelet activation/consumption, and endothelial damage. However, the use of 5 % albumin in priming the CPB machine has many advantages, such as preservation of oncotic pressure, preventing fibrinogen and platelet adhesion, and endothelial glycocalyx protection. In addition, it maintains the vascular barrier competency, prevents interstitial edema, and keeps the integrity of the microcirculation [64].",
        "Oliver et al. compared 5 % albumin priming with fresh frozen plasma (FFP)-based priming in pediatric patients [65]. Patients in the 5 % albumin group had significantly lower administration of blood products. It was shown that using albumin for the priming volume, a dilution of coagulation factors is accepted during CPB. This will lead to less thrombin generation and consumption of coagulation factors and the FFP will be supplemented after protamine administration. However, the use of FFP as a priming solution will result in enhancing the thrombin formation during CPB, thereby more heparin is needed and more consumption of coagulation factors is triggered.",
        "The use of albumin in priming the adult CPB may compete with fibrinogen in the formation of the protein layer coating the circuit and the oxygenator, and the preadsorption of albumin prevents fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. Russell et al. have shown in their meta-analysis that albumin compared with crystalloids as a priming solution exerts a number of beneficial effects, including platelet count and colloid osmotic preservation [66].",
        "The use of albumin in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery has resulted in the preservation in clot formation time and maximum clot firmness. However, the use of low molar hydroxyethyl starch solutions (HES) (6 % 200/0.5 or 130/0.4) resulted in prolongation in clot formation time and reduction in maximum clot firmness [67]. Moreover, the use of old high-molar HES and gelatin solutions correlated with the amount of postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but the use of 4 % albumin solution did not [68]. The same results have been confirmed in a meta-analysis comparing the use of HES solutions with albumin. Hemodynamics were similar in both groups, but the use of albumin decreased blood loss, the amount of blood products transfusions, and the need for reoperation postoperatively [69]. The presence of hypoalbuminemia (cutoff 18 g/L) after cardiac surgery was found to be a better predictor for mortality after cardiac surgery – even better than EUROscore [70]. In a recently published prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the preemptive correction of a low preoperative albumin level by administering HSA in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is associated significant reduction in the incidence of AKI, from 26 % in the control group to 13.7 % in the albumin group. The editorial that accompanied the study has suggested that restoring the target level is associated with reduction in AKI in amplitude greater than that of any known intervention in patients undergoing OPCAB [71, 72].",
        "Edwin Cohn’s development of stable albumin solution during World War II was based on a fractionation scheme, which was rapidly adopted by a number of pharmaceutical companies. The pasteurization technique used in albumin solutions production is very effective in eliminating the risk for viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, the recent introduction of ion exchange chromatography in the production of albumin is very effective in reducing the risk of prion disease transmission by albumin solutions [73]. The use of albumin is considered safe practice; in a study evaluating adverse event reporting between 1998 and 2000, the incidence of all reported serious nonfatal and fatal adverse events was just five per million doses, and no patient death was classified as probably related to albumin administration [74].",
        "Currently available human albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidants prosperities, and capacity to bind drugs [75]. It is noteworthy to mention that cysteine 34 – the most important antioxidant residue in HSA – is oxidized in 23 % of healthy human volunteers versus 54–60 % in commercial preparations [76], which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions [77].",
        "Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20–25 % or 4–5 %. Iso-oncotic preparations of HSA are more effective than crystalloids solutions in maintaining the intravascular volume (>80 % vs. <20 %) [78]. Hypertonic albumin (20–25 %) is used in patients with edema as it avoids excessive sodium and chloride loads [75]. Nevertheless, hypotonic 4 % solutions should not be used in patients with traumatic brain injuries.",
        "The excessive need for the HSA solutions has encouraged its production using recombinant DNA technology in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. HSA molecule structure is quite complicated; with 35 cysteine residues, 34 of them form disulfide bonds. Such complicated structure in this large recombinant protein could be a burden in both protein synthesis and folding system, which could result in the low expression or incorrect folding of recombinant HSA (rHSA). Recently, transgenic rice Oryza sativa has been used successfully as a novel bioreactor to produce sufficient quantities of safe rHSA. However, to establish appropriate impurity removal and detection methods in rHSA manufacturing remains a challenge (Fig. 9.4) [79, 80].\n",
        "HSA has many physiological and biochemical properties that render its use relevant to many aspects of the disordered vascular and cellular functions. HSA has not yet showed all its secrets, and its benefits can only be realized by conducting clinical trials appropriately powered to relevant clinical endpoints."

        "The COVID‐19 pandemic is an unprecedented episode in the last 100 years of human history. All of Canadian society will feel the impact of this pandemic. Beyond the immediate threat to health, employment, and income, food is one area where we will see an impact across all Canadians. What is more, agents and economic actors across the entirety of our agri‐food supply chains will feel this impact. Given that consumer demand pulls food through these agri‐food supply chains, it is important to understand Canadians’ food demand in the immediacy of the pandemic and related economic downturn, and likely through the shadow of both.",
        "The disruption to society and markets arising from Black Swan events is not new. Examples from the last two decades include the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, the 2003 SARS epidemic, the 2003 North American BSE crisis, various food safety recalls,1To be clear, there is no evidence to suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic is a food safety issue. the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. COVID‐19 is different. It is different because this is a highly contagious virus for which no known and proven vaccine yet exists. It is different because of the economic disruption arising from the shuttering of economic and commercial activity on an almost unparalleled scale. It is different because of the disruption to work, home, and personal routine (e.g., working from home, physical distancing, school closures, closure of non‐essential business, the response by food service and grocery retail sectors). It is different because we are dealing with the concurrence of a viral pandemic and economic downturn. While the response to and impact of past Black Swan events are informative, they cannot help us fully anticipate the impact of the double‐whammy of such a significant viral pandemic and economic downturn.",
        "This paper explores how COVID‐19 could impact consumer demand for food. The paper contains no literature review, no conceptual or empirical model, nor any empirical analysis. It offers some thoughts intended to stimulate discussion (and research). The paper is structured around five areas: the structure of preferences, household budgets, price effects, socioeconomic factors, and consumer behavior. It is important to emphasize that the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand (and shopping behaviors) will differ across the intersection of individual and household experiences, characteristics, and contexts. In understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on demand for food, there is no average effect that carries meaning. Differential impacts and distributional consequences will be profoundly important in understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand.",
        "The structure of preferences will be an important issue in understanding how consumers respond to COVID‐19. I see three immediate areas where the structure of the utility function should reflect the circumstances around COVID‐19. The first concerns what is in a consumer's utility function. Beyond consumption quantities, one might imagine that in light of COVID‐19, the well‐being of others might enter into one's utility function. This gets at whether an individual is making decisions for themselves, or in a way that reflects the wellbeing of others (be they other members of the household, family, or broader society). In this respect, notions of altruism and interdependent utility functions become important. More broadly than this, one could think about incorporating the notions of personal and social capital in the utility function and defining these forms of latent capital as functions of choices made (Becker & Murphy, 2000). The idea here would be that an individual derives utility of services flowing from personal and social capital, while personal and social capital depend on the elements of choice and may well reflect the choice one makes for themselves, others, and conceivably others’ choice.",
        "Second, the temporal nature of choice also needs consideration when thinking about consumer demand for food in a pandemic. The issue is whether food consumption occurs at the time of purchase. Under normal circumstances, most households separate the purchase and consumption decisions, leading to home inventories being held as a matter of convenience. Given changes to the retail grocery landscape (e.g., some stores having reduced hours or limits on the number of people in the store at one time, and transaction costs associated with on‐line purchasing, etc.) it may be that some consumers continue to purchase and store inventories at home as a matter of convenience. It is also possible that some households increase their home inventories to reduce the number of future shopping trips (and thus limiting their perceived risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus).",
        "Purchasing now for later consumption introduces a dynamic inventory problem that reflects a discount rate for the future utility from consumption. This brings into to play two important issues—consumer discount rates and the time horizon in a consumer's mind when deciding how much to buy now for later consumption. I would hazard a guess that the planning horizon is longer in the COVID‐19 environment, and discount rates smaller, thus making future consumption more of a concern, and leading to excess inventory holding. Temporal considerations could also affect what is purchased. Given a longer planning horizon, and potentially lower discount rates, one might expect to see a rise in demand for easily stored food items, and a fall in demand for not easily stored food items or foods whose quality falls with storage. In this respect we might see substitution between the form the underlying food good takes—for instance, substituting between fresh fruit and canned fruit.",
        "Excess inventory holding leads to the third structure of preference issue, namely uncertainty. A longer time horizon and lower discount rates may lead to excess inventory holding compared to pre‐COVID‐19 periods, but so too could risk or uncertainty. In the absence of a definite end to the COVID‐19 pandemic, some may undertake excess in‐home food inventory holding as an insurance against future stockouts at the grocery store—a consumer version of the convenience yield in commodity storage if you will. In this sense, “hoarding” may be a rational response to expected future stockouts, with the cost of excess purchases viewed as a risk premium for informal insurance against grocery store stockouts. If true, then somewhat paradoxically, this form of self‐insurance could lead to behaviors that create a stockout.",
        "While the structure of preferences is important to bear in mind, so too are limits on choice through income and time constraints. Continuance of income/cash flows is important in understanding consumer response to COVID‐19. For those affected by a loss of income, an open and important question is whether and how participation in Canada's Employment Insurance program and the recently announced Canada Emergency Response Benefit impacts their demand for food. Also important is whether and how demand for food changes by those whose incomes are partially supported by their employers accessing the federal government's Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program. On both scores, the potential distribution effects will be important to understand. An individual's capacity to draw on saving or liquid assets, or rely on credit‐based (e.g., credit cards or a line of credit) consumption smoothing, are also important factors to consider, and which carry broader distribution issues insofar as access to credit is concerned.",
        "Demand for food and most food products in Canada tends to be income‐normal. We would expect a proportionally smaller reduction in demand for a food product than the proportional reduction in income/expenditure. Despite this, lessons from the 2008/2009 financial crisis remind us of what we might expect to see—namely, a higher degree of economizing in the food purchasing decision in the face of income/expenditure reductions. This can take varied forms, including eliminating the purchase of foods not deemed essential in the consumers' mind, reduced consumption of some goods, or within‐category substituting away from relatively higher‐priced alternatives. In light of expected income reductions, we might also expect to see a fall in demand for some niche and premium priced food products as people substitute towards value‐priced and non‐niche equivalents. While not related to food, we might also see deferral or postponing of big‐ticket purchases (e.g., vacation, durable goods, etc.) and mortgage/rent deferrals as a way to generate liquidity to support the purchase of necessities. Unlike the 2008/2009 financial crisis, large portions of the foodservice sector have closed or changed their business model in light of COVID‐19—by circumstance, we are seeing fewer Canadians eating out of the home. What we do not know is whether the resulting reduction in household expenditures on services translates into greater liquidity when buying food for consumption in the home. We do not really understand the degree of substitutability between expenditure on food consumed in the home and food consumed out of the home, and especially so during an event like COVID‐19.",
        "The allocation of individual and household time is also changing, and this might impact the demand for food. School closures, the closing of non‐essential businesses, work‐from‐home arrangements, and closing of recreational facilities, churches, and other civic venues, and their programs, means more Canadians are at home. Some have more time available for new uses, while others will have new and competing demands on their time. This new organization of households and decisions concerning an individual's allocation of time could have a bearing on demand for food. On the one hand, I could imagine individuals and households undertaking a more concerted effort to consume food prepared in the home, and which offer potentially enhanced health and nutrition profiles. On the other hand, I can see the new challenges of household organization and individual time use leading to a rise in demand for prepared, heat‐and‐eat food products, as well as meal kits. Both carry an expectation of an increase in demand, but demand for ingredients on the one hand, and convenience foods on the other. What we actually observe will depend on the lifecycle and composition of the home, and the duration of the pandemic and closure of foodservice establishments offering dine‐in options. A longer pandemic might lead some to invest in human capital by learning new food preparation skills that enable them to create meals from base ingredients, rather than relying on prepared foods. But, the time pressure for those working‐from‐home and with children (or other dependents) in the home will be different from those who are not working and/or do not have children (or other dependents) in the home. The opportunity cost of one's time (and within the context of the household) will be very important in understanding how consumer demand for food changes in response to COVID‐19, and in understanding a decision to invest in new food preparation skills.",
        "At the time of writing, we cannot attribute COVID‐19 to widespread, persistent changes in the price of food. While stockouts have occurred, the price impact of these stockouts appears muted by a responsive supply chain. Unlike legislated or regulated rationing and price controls implemented during WWII, we have not seen institutional rationing or price controls outside of preexisting conditions in some regulated agricultural markets. This is not to say that price gouging has not happened in the face of spikes in demand, but we have the ability to protect consumers through established Federal and Provincial consumer protection and emergency legislation. For instance, using the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, the Province of Ontario recently announced new fines and penalties for those found guilty of price gouging. Other means of “policing” pricing behavior also exist—for instance, using social media to publicly shame establishments undertaking such practices, and firms self‐policing their pricing policies as a matter of good public relations and corporate governance.",
        "Supply chain responsiveness is key to the short‐run price stability we have seen thus far. However, longer‐term effects are less clear, especially as the first expected wave of COVID‐19 is accelerating at a time when much of North American agricultural is begin its planting season. We may well see price increases in the future if there are systematic and sustained disruption of distribution channels or agricultural production.2One issue which might be particularly important in Canada in this regard is access to seasonal agricultural workers. Demand for many groups of commodities tends to be price inelastic, meaning the expected proportional impact on demand would be less than the proportional increase in price. As well, given the variety of quality, selection and varying price points in most grocery stores, I would expect the between and intragroup substitutability to be an important part of how consumers economize in the face of relative price increases.",
        "Preferences, prices, and income are important considerations in understanding how demand for food responds during the COVID‐19 crisis. But so too are sociodemographic factors that reflect the lifecycle of the individual and household. This is not to say that sociodemographic factors drive changes in demand; rather, that changes in food demand arising from COVID‐19 may have a differential effect across individuals and households with different characteristics. Ignoring these sociodemographic effects robs us of understanding the deeper insights of how COVID‐19 may affect consumer demand for food in Canada. But what sociodemographic factors do you consider? A variety of observables come to mind: gender and identity, age, education, migrant status, employment status, ability status, and household composition are all important. So too is the intersection of these characteristics insofar as defining broader segments of consumers that might lend itself to insights about common responses across subgroups of the population at similar stages of their lifecycles.",
        "Additional consideration should be given to sociodemographic characteristics which capture those in vulnerable groups. These groups include those who face precarious employment (and income), the homeless, those who face food insecurity, and those who are immune compromised or for whom it would be unwise to leave their homes in light of the COVID‐19 virus. While not at all exhaustive, I hope this underscores the fact that there are groups with precarious socioeconomic status who may be marginalized, and whose food demands may be particularly affected by COVID‐19.",
        "COVID‐19 is affecting where and how people shop, and may well influence what people buy and consume. Weeks into the COVID‐19 pandemic and we are seeing changes in the channel and venue that people use to acquire food. Restaurants are almost universally closed for order‐in or sit‐down service, and those that remain open are doing so with reduced hours, a limited menu selection, and delivery or drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options. This means Canadians have likely reduced their frequency of eating out of the home. Interestingly, restaurants that only offer drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options point to the role of transport and the intersection of access to transport and socioeconomic status. For some, transportation needed to access food may be a limiting factor. Reductions in public transport services in some locales (as a means to limit the risk of exposure to COVID‐19) potentially magnifies this effect. Nonetheless, as mentioned previously, reduced food‐away‐from‐home options could alleviate income effects in that a dollar now spent in a grocery store may go further than a dollar previously spent in a foodservice establishment. Admittedly, this comparison omits a time and skill element; planning and preparing a meal takes time and knowledge—account needs to be taken of the in‐sourced services now provided by the consumer (or in‐home food preparer) that the foodservice establishment provided previously.",
        "Most retail grocery venues remain open but with reduced hours (to give staff a break and allow for restocking) and, in some cases, with limits on the number of people in the store at any given time (as a means of ensuring physical distancing), and limits on how much of an item one may buy at one time. In some locales, farmers' markets have been closed as a means of limiting the risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus, potentially having an impact on buying locally. We have also seen dedicated hours for those in more vulnerable groups at some retail grocery chains. As I mentioned above, we are likely seeing less frequent trips to grocery venues—likely due to heightened concerns of exposure to the COVID‐19, directives by various levels of government, or competing demands on time arising from new home‐based activities (e.g., care of dependents). At the same time, we are seeing a rise in online grocery shopping (Robertson, 2020), and I would expect to see a rise in home meal kits. The timing of online grocery services is an issue, with longer lead times for orders than before the COVID‐19 pandemic, thus requiring more planning and potentially placing greater demands on the time needed for food choice in the household.",
        "I believe it would be a fool's errand to predict changes in demand for a particular food or food group. Too much is changing too fast. But, two observations come to bear in the context of what people are buying. First, we are seeing evidence that the food manufacturing sector is changing their product runs to focus on more basic product forms (Baum & Robertson, 2020). Second, we are seeing a rise in demand for the ingredients used in baking (Strong, 2020). The former might point to market responsiveness in the context of firm's expectation of consumers economizing behavior. The latter might point to Canadians seeking self‐sufficiency in light of the pandemic (i.e., in‐sourcing the preparation of what we otherwise buy in a prepared form, e.g., making bread at home instead of buying it at a store), or an inclination toward foods that bring comfort in a time of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. It will be interesting to see if the demand for foods or food ingredients that contain “comfort” attributes will rise during the pandemic.",
        "Several other issues arise in the context of shopping behavior and what people buy. As it appears some people are stocking up, will there be an unintended rise in food waste related to perishable products, or products which exceed their best before date prior to consumption? Relatedly, how will people use leftovers to make their food dollar go further and potentially limit the number of trips they make to a grocery venue (or limit the number of orders they make online). Lastly, how will changes in consumption behaviors manifest themselves in a movement along an Engel curve (pointing to the greater importance in food expenditure during a recession) and translate into a change in farmer's share of consumer's food dollar?",
        "This paper explores several issues related to the potential impact of COVID‐19 on food demand. It offers casual observation with no analysis. Moving beyond a static, certain approach to the structure of preferences will help us understand observed behavior (e.g., stockpiling) and possibly understanding future behaviors in a COVID‐19 world. Income and time constraints will matter. Tighter incomes will likely lead to substituting behaviors within and between food groups. However, people shifting food expenditures from away‐from‐home to in‐home consumption will temper this effect. New routines forced by work‐from‐home requirements, school closures, and physical distancing will impact the opportunity cost of time and may lead to new food behaviors. Muted short‐run retail food price effects are evident. However, how the agricultural sector fares in light of physical distancing and possible disruptions to agricultural labor markets and production practices lends itself to the possibility of higher food prices in the long run (and possibly increased price volatility). It will be important to understand the impact on food demand arising from policy interventions related to wages and income. This understanding should take account of sociodemographic factors, and the intersection of these factors. Lastly, where and how people shop has and will continue to change as the COVID‐19 pandemic evolves in Canada. Whether these changes persist will depend on the duration of the pandemic and associated economic downturn.",
        "Like all countries, Canada has groups vulnerable to and affected by food insecurity. However, as a nation, Canadians have come to expect an assured supply of food. While recent spikes in demand at the food retail level have led to stockouts, the responsive nature of our food supply chains means these shortages have been short‐lived. Given that COVID‐19 has not led to restrictions on food and agricultural trade, and given the resilient nature of our agricultural sector, I remain optimistic about the continuity of the food supply. Barring significant disruption to agricultural production, my thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will drive most of the changes we will observe in food markets. In this respect, income/expenditure, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons will account for the lion's share of these demand‐side drivers. I hope these musings will stimulate discussion amongst the broader community and lead to empirical analysis that improves our understanding of whether and how a Black Swan event like COVID‐19 affects consumer choice."

        "Small-scale pig production (free range or small backyard herds) constitutes >70 % of the total pig farms in East Africa. Pigs in this region often live in close proximity to humans, causing public health concerns and a need for increasing health standards. East Africa is also known for the large population of wild (bush) pigs and warthogs that are in close contact with domestic pigs, creating favorable conditions for intermixing and spread of viral strains. Emerging viruses represent a threat to human and food animal health, as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of influenza and coronavirus infection. Hence, knowledge about the diversity of viruses present in reservoir animals can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. Kobuviruses, which are members of the genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, are small, non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. The genus Kobuvirus includes three officially recognized species: Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B (bovine kobuvirus), and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus) [1]. The kobuvirus genome is approximately 8.3 kb long and is organized into three structural (VP0, VP3 and VP1) and seven non-structural (2A-2C and 3A-3D) regions with a leader protein (L). The 3D gene region encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and represents a region that is conserved among kobuviruses [2]. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the 3D RdRp coding region among porcine kobuvirus, bovine kobuvirus and Aichi virus vary from 74.0 % to 81.0 % [3]. Aichi virus was first detected in Japan in 1989 from a human patient with acute gastroenteritis [4]. Since then, Aichi virus has been detected in Asia, Europe, South America and Tunisia [5–8]. Bovine kobuvirus was first recognized in 2003 as a cytopathic contaminant in cell culture medium derived from bovine serum in Japan. Later, it was found in fecal samples of clinically healthy cattle [9]. Bovine kobuvirus has also been detected in domestic sheep in Hungary [10, 11]. Porcine kobuvirus (S-1-HUN/2007: EU787450) was first identified from fecal samples of domestic pigs in 2008 in Hungary [1]. Thereafter, porcine kobuvirus was reported in additional countries, including Asian countries [12, 13], the Netherlands and Brazil [14], and the USA [15]. The prevalence of kobuvirus infection in pigs ranges from 30 % to 99 %. This large variation could be a result of different ages within the populations evaluated, diarrheal status, regional differences, and other factors. Studies showing association of porcine kobuvirus infection with clinical disease are limited; however, a recent study in Korea found an association between porcine kobuvirus detection and diarrhea in pigs [13]. An association between kobuvirus infection and age has been reported in cattle and in pigs [16].",
        "Astroviruses belong to the family Astroviridae, which consists of two genera: Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus, whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, respectively. Astroviruses are generally associated with either mild or severe enteric disease symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting in a number of mammalian species [17]. Bridger in the UK and Saif et al. [18, 19] in the USA reported the first porcine astroviruses (PAstV) detected in pigs by electron microscopy. Later in 1990, PAstV was isolated in Japan [20]. Recently, Mor and co-workers also reported PAstV in pigs in the USA with a prevalence of 62 % [21]. To date, five PAstV types (PAstV1–PAstV5) have been identified from different countries, including the Czech Republic, Colombia, Canada, the USA, China and Hungary [22–27]. Among the five types, PAstV1, PAstV2 and PAstV3 were identified in fecal samples from healthy pigs.",
        "Epidemiological information on the geographical distribution, incidence and genetic diversity of kobuviruses in African swine populations is not available. In this study, we report the first detection of porcine kobuviruses in samples collected from nursing and weaned pigs in East Africa and analyze the phylogenetic relationships between the East African porcine kobuvirus strains and known kobuvirus strains as well as other representative picornaviruses. This study also reports the first detection of porcine astrovirus in this region.",
        "Accession numbers of nucleotide sequences strains described in this study were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: kobuviruses, KF494340-KF494343 and KF597279; astroviruses, KF597280-KF597282.",
        "A total of 251 fecal samples were obtained from nursing and post-weaning piglets raised in small-scale farms (n = 1 to 25 pigs per farm) with different management systems in western Kenya (n = 140) and eastern Uganda (n = 111). The management system consisted of pigs being housed, housed and tethered, housed and free-range, tethered, tethered and free-range and free-range. The pigs were mostly fed swill from hotels and leftover household food. The sample collection consisted of 41 samples from nursing pigs (less than 4 weeks of age), 90 samples from post-weaning pigs (12 weeks of age) and 120 samples from growers (16 weeks of age). All pigs appeared clinically healthy at the time of sampling. Fresh samples were collected from individual pigs, placed into a sterile specimen container and stored on dry ice before being transported to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) laboratory in Busia, where the samples were stored at −70 °C until use. The samples were then shipped to the BecA-ILRI laboratories in Nairobi for analysis.",
        "Fecal samples were prepared as 10 % (v/v) fecal suspensions in minimum essential medium (MEM). The prepared sample suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1,800×g, 4 °C. RNA was extracted from a 250-μl starting volume of centrifuged 10 % fecal suspensions using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA recovered was suspended in 40 μl of nuclease-free water and stored at −70 °C until used. cDNA was synthesised using a Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific®) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and the cDNA was immediately used for amplification or stored at −20 °C.",
        "Previous studies using the calicivirus primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29] targeting the calicivirus RdRp gene (317 nt for norovirus and 329 nt for sapovirus) also amplified the 3D RdRp regions of porcine kobuvirus (~1100 nt) [15], which was confirmed by sequence analysis of five representative suspect samples in the present report. This same primer pair was used for the detection of porcine kobuviruses from East African pigs. RT-PCR was carried out using Accupower® PCR premix (Bioneer Co, S. Korea) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Accupower® PCR premix is a ready-to-use lyophilized premix of dNTPs, Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, a tracking dye, and a stabilizer. Briefly, in each 20-μl reaction premix tube, 2 μl (5-50 ng) of cDNA template was mixed with 1 μl (10 pMol) each of forward and reverse primers, and 16 μl of nuclease-free water. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C of 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The temperature was then held at 4 °C. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after staining with Gel Red™ nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium, Hayward, CA). When bands were found in the region of 1,100 bp on the agarose gel, we tentatively considered the results kobuvirus positive. The samples with the correct band size were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing. In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the PCR products of three selected samples from three different farms were determined by direct sequencing.",
        "To confirm the RT-PCR results and to obtain genetic information on virus diversity, the partial 3D RdRp amplicons of five kobuvirus-positive samples were sequenced directly using forward (p110) and reverse (p290) primers using BigDye Terminator cycle chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting RdRP gene sequences were edited using Bioedit version 7.1.9 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and compared with sequences of kobuvirus reference strains in the GenBank database by BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequence similarity analysis was performed for the aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Phylogenetic analysis of the East African porcine kobuviruses with kobuvirus reference strains based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments was conducted using the neighbor-joining method supported with a bootstrap test of 1000 replicates in MEGA 5 software [30]. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tamura 3-parameter method and are in units of base substitutions per site.",
        "To analyze porcine kobuvirus infection in pigs of different ages with different management systems, the piglet fecal samples were divided according to the age of the animals into three groups: nursing, ≤1-month-old (n = 47), weaned, (3-month-old, n = 90) and growers (>4-month-old, n = 120). Statistical analysis was performed with SAS® to compare the proportions of kobuvirus-positive samples among the four districts, the two countries, the three age groups evaluated and the six different management systems. The analysis was performed using the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test. The confidence limit for the statistical tests was set at 95 % (P < 0.05).",
        "Kobuvirus RNA was detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the pig fecal samples analyzed using primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29]. Kobuvirus was detected in both Kenya (14.9 %) and Uganda (15.5 %) in equal proportions, and in all four districts sampled (Table 1), an indication of a general circulation and endemicity of the virus on the tested farms. Among the age groups, younger piglets shed more virus than older pigs, and a higher incidence (15 of 90, 16.7 %) of kobuvirus was reported in post-weaning (3-month-old) piglets compared to nursing piglets (6 of 41, 14.6 %) and grower pigs (12 of 120, 10 %). This could possibly be due to an inefficient immune response, diminishing maternal immunity post-weaning, or other intrinsic age-related factors. Higher rates of infection in young piglets has also been reported in other studies [3, 13, 14]. Based on management systems in the study area, confinement of pigs presented a higher risk of kobuvirus infection, with housed pigs shedding more virus than free-ranging pigs (Table 1). This could be the result of viral accumulation in the pig houses or the places where pigs are tethered. Additionally, kobuvirus was more prevalent in the farms with larger herd size (>10 pigs, 20 %) than farms with small herds (<10 pigs, 12.6 %).\n",
        "The incidence of porcine kobuvirus infection reported in this study (13.1 %) was lower than that reported in other countries, which ranged between 30.1 % in China and 99 % in Thailand [3, 31–33]. A recent study in Korea detected porcine kobuvirus in 84.5 % of diarrheic pigs and 19.3 % of healthy pigs [13]. Similarly, a study in Japan using samples from healthy pigs reported 45.4 % prevalence of porcine kobuvirus [12]. This difference may be attributable to variations in the samples due to factors like sampling time, sampling place (distribution of sampling farms), sample size, age of pigs, and clinical background of the tested animal population (diarrhea or clinically healthy). The association of this agent with enteric diseases in pigs in the study area remains unclear, since we only analyzed samples from asymptomatic pigs, and no data were available from tests for kobuvirus in pigs with gastroenteritis from the same farms; however, some of the positive samples came from farms with a history of diarrhea. This study confirmed that infection with kobuvirus in asymptomatic pigs is common, as has been reported in other studies [14, 32, 34]. Further studies on risk factors for this infection and the association of this virus with gastroenteritis are necessary, especially in developing countries where a majority of pigs are raised in smallholder production systems with varied management.",
        "To gain more information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine kobuvirus strains circulating in swine in the East African farms, five kobuvirus-positive samples were selected, and their partial 3D RdRP region was sequenced. Genetic analysis of the partial sequence revealed that the kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are more variable, sharing nucleotide sequence identity ranging from 89.7 from 99.1 % among them. At the nucleotide and amino acid level, they were 69.4–70.7 % and 70.7–71.9 % identical, respectively, to Aichi virus, 73.1–74.4 % and 78.8–80.5 % to bovine kobuvirus, 70.8-71.9 % and 78.5-79.5 % to kobuvirus in sheep, 67-70.7 % and 67.8-69.1 % to canine kobuviruses and 88-92.3 % and 90.4-97.5 % to other porcine kobuviruses (Table 2).\n",
        "Phylogenetic analysis of partial 3D RdRp nucleotide and amino acid sequences of porcine kobuvirus strains detected in this study, together with published sequences of kobuvirus reference strains (porcine kobuviruses, aichi viruses and bovine kobuvirus) and representatives of other picornaviruses, revealed that three of the detected strains (Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279) grouped together and formed their own cluster, while one of the strains (K-118-KF494342) clustered with Chinese strains, and another strain (K-460-KF494343) clustered with Korean strains (Fig. 1). This indicates that porcine kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are genetically diverse. Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279 samples were collected in the same geographical location, indicating that porcine kobuviruses in the East African region may be geographically restricted; however, more strains from different parts of East Africa need to be sequenced to ascertain the geographical distribution of this virus. Genetic diversity among geographically separated porcine kobuviruses have been reported in other studies [13].\n",
        "Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that the five strains detected were more closely related to the kobuviruses, notably porcine kobuvirus, than to any other picornaviruses, and this was supported by the 100 % bootstrap value (Fig. 1). Evidence of a close genetic relationship or interspecies transmission among different viruses in the genus Kobuvirus has been documented. A sheep kobuvirus strain has high nucleotide sequence identity to bovine kobuvirus [10], and one porcine kobuvirus is more closely related to bovine kobuvirus than to porcine strains [12]. However, in this study, we did not find kobuvirus strains that were similar to members of kobuviruses from species other than pigs.",
        "In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific RT-PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the RT-PCR products of three selected samples were determined by direct sequencing, and the result showed that one of the strains (K-268-KF597282) had 86.1 % nt sequence identity to porcine astrovirus type 2 in the RdRp gene. The other two strains (K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281) had 96.7 % identity to porcine astrovirus type 3. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, in which K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281 strains clustered with astrovirus type 3 (PAstV-3-US-MO123-JX556691) detected in the USA, while the K-268-KF597282 strain clustered with astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2/2007/HUN-GU562296) detected in Hungary (Fig. 2). Recent studies in the USA revealed high genetic heterogeneity of PAstV strains [35]. The importance of co-circulation of PAstVs and the role pigs may play in the transmission and recombination of this virus need further investigation.\n",
        "In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses are present in the swine population in East Africa, and to our knowledge, this study reports the first detection of porcine kobuvirus and astrovirus in this African region and the first molecular analysis of the detected strains. The presence of these gastroenteritis-producing viruses in clinically healthy pigs represents a source of infection of pigs, and possibly to humans, and hence, further studies are required to determine their role in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine their genetic diversity in order to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies."

        "One Health (OH) positions health professionals as agents for change and provides a platform to both measure and manage determinants of health seldom fully covered by medicine or public health alone. The integration of human, animal, and environmental health has a long history (1–4). Recent financial, economic, social, environmental, and health crises have led to the renewed recognition that collaborative approaches between disciplines are urgently needed (5, 6). The fear of emerging pandemics, as well as climate change, drug resistance, food and water security and safety, has caused a shift from an interdisciplinary approach, whereby experts collaborate across disciplinary boundaries, to a transdisciplinary approach that integrates society and science by including all stakeholders (5, 7, 8). This transcends traditional boundaries, and integrates knowledge and perspectives from scientific and non-scientific sources (9, 10). Many communities involved in health issues have proposed transdisciplinary and systemic approaches with different focuses, such as Ecohealth, Global Health, Planetary Health, or Health in scaled Social–Ecological Systems (7, 8). While there is considerable literature describing what integrated approaches to health could be, there are no recognized guidelines—to our knowledge—on how to evaluate to what extent the underlying integration as a principle and approach contributes to constructive management of complex health problems, such as antibiotic resistance or outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus disease. OH emphasizes the commonalities of human, animal, plant, and environmental health. In this perspective, it can be regarded as an “umbrella” term that captures integrative approaches to health across these highly interlinked components (4, 11). Due to the existing, historically contingent, organization of societies and disciplines, and the sectoral allocation of resources, developing integrated approaches is difficult, and benefits can be delayed. There is thus a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH to governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders (5, 12) and to explore how to evaluate integrated approaches to health. The Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH)1 is an initiative funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology that aims to address this by developing a framework and protocols for the evaluation of OH initiatives and by providing examples of their application.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe evaluable characteristics of OH approaches, and to present what they can encompass and achieve. This provides a basis for evaluation of OH initiatives and their outcomes, which could not be achieved using standard, sectoral approaches.",
        "Factors identified as drivers (Figure 1) define the need for change toward OH approaches, based on a collective perception of a given problem. Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15). In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human’s access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16). At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17).",
        "Although OH initiatives can range from development projects to educational programs, research projects, and intergovernmental strategies, they often have specific operating principles, characterized by a way of thinking, planning, and working. We selected this classification, as it represents a sequence from abstract thoughts over planning of an initiative to concrete implementation. The realization that certain health and welfare challenges cannot be dealt with from a single disciplinary perspective thus calls for a re-evaluation of approaches to deal with health and welfare challenges. “OH thinking” is holistic, inclusive, respectful, and tolerant, as opposed to approaches that are specific, reductionist, with a tendency to focus on single or limited outcomes that impact positively on few people only. It considers multiple scales of life, disciplines, sectors, species, paradigms, and demographics, and integrates at different spatial scales (e.g., locally, nationally, and globally). This should reflect the connected nature of social relations and social systems, both in their material and symbolic dimensions as well as the degradation of national resources due to globalization (18). “OH planning” requires that aims, problem formulation, responsibilities, and financing are organized, regardless of organizational hierarchies, paradigms, sectors, and disciplines. Most fundamentally, it necessitates clarity in establishing roles, tasks, responsibilities, and competencies (including leadership, power, and authority) within the specific OH initiative. OH aims to identify acceptable and manageable solutions to problems within a given context. Only after establishing a consensus, it (OH) can work and responsibilities be effectively allocated within the system.",
        "Consequently, “OH working” relies on transdisciplinary collaboration that embraces contributions from the biological, natural and social sciences, and actively includes stakeholders in the process, from problem definitions to resolution. To operate as conceived, OH must rely on adequate information infrastructure and foster learning across all scales and fields (19). A learning framework allows for stakeholders and institutions to evolve and improve autonomously, and requires mechanisms for knowledge exchange, institutional memory, feedback, and regulation. This relies on sharing of knowledge, data, resources, and staff across sectors and disciplines. This working paradigm will often lead to complex, polycentric organizational structures that support development toward sustainability and resilience (20). To succeed, they rely on multiple, strong connections and coordinated activities across sectors, for example, joint health services for humans and animals (21, 22), and/or for the environment (23).",
        "The expected outcomes of OH initiatives are health and welfare of humans, animals, plants, and ecosystems, all managed by common health strategies. This ensures healthy food, as well as clean water and air. Transdisciplinarity should result in improved stewardship and compliance, and promote interspecies equity, which would facilitate sustainable benefits for humans from other species (domestic and wild) and their habitats. Furthermore, OH should improve effectiveness across different sectors and at multiple scales. It relies on and results in more efficient communication, thereby generating a higher degree of awareness that can enable rapid detection of illness and consequent action. By having a more inclusive voice for neglected human populations, animals, and environment, OH is intended to widen our usual anthropocentric perspectives and to simultaneously enhance human health. The expected outcomes of OH approaches contribute to the three pillars of sustainability, namely, society, environment, and economy. In this way, the approach can be an instrument to working toward the UN sustainable development goals.2 Overall, OH is expected to result in the consideration of long-term effects of policy decisions, resilience at various scales, food and feed security, and ultimately sustainable lifestyles.",
        "Most diseases identified by WHO in their global burden of disease analysis,3 from neglected zoonotic and tropical diseases to lifestyle diseases (e.g., depression, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, and malnutrition) are derived, to some degree, from the social–ecological system in which they occur. Many isolated disciplinary or sectoral approaches to deal with these health challenges have proven ineffective, either not durable or associated with economic and/or environmental damage (4, 7). The change of focus from disease to health across species, ecosystems, and scales constitutes an effective model to address these challenges. This model extends from cells, through individuals, populations to global systems and across different time scales (4). Some propose considering health beyond health, i.e., the global economic, political, and cultural context, where, for example, the changing patterns of emerging diseases in Africa or Asia may be caused by investment strategies at the New York, London, and Hong Kong stock exchanges (17, 24).",
        "As demonstrated by the global AIDS response, this inclusive governance challenges current global norms, calls for global accountability, and reveals inextricable links between health, human rights, and social, economic, and political empowerment (25). By formulating apparently distant threats, such as climate change or soil erosion, from a health perspective, legal or economic actions may be accelerated, thereby leading to political decisions (6), through the willingness to accept trade-offs. Many health decisions are linked to dilemmas between scales, namely, individual versus social or global ecological interests. The solution lies in a continuous process of negotiation that includes all stakeholders and results in benefits from the interaction between different sectors (26). OH acknowledges that people’s choices are made within a context of economic, social, and cultural values.",
        "Such a change in approach requires resources. Consequently, it is important to demonstrate common interests of economic, environmental, social, and health advocates to provide appropriate funding, albeit under challenging economic constraints (6). We identified clear parallels between OH and the concept of sustainability with its three pillars, i.e., society, environment, and economy. On this basis, the added value of OH as compared to single sector approaches can be assessed through monitoring aspects in these three pillars. For example, the social dimension may be monitored by examining the acceptability of interventions, the contribution to enhancing human capital, supporting solidarity, maintaining equity, diversity, participation, interconnectedness and partnerships, democracy, and political alignment and their adaptations to the relevant social–ecological context. The environmental dimension may be monitored using fresh-water quality, ocean quality, air and soil quality, biodiversity, species-specific health, and the overlap with ecosystem services. Finally, the economic dimension can be assessed by estimating the costs and the benefits of interventions to the widest possible extent, including not only the values that can be directly appraised through market prices but also the values of non-market goods and resources, which mostly depend on environmental and social achievements and are of particular importance for human and animal health and welfare.",
        "To achieve systemic and scaled resilience to health challenges, the ultimate task for policy makers and other health professionals is to endorse health of people, animals, plants, and the environment and to achieve equitable and sustainable health outcomes (27, 28). To implement the concept of OH, “OH thinking,” “planning,” and “working” promote equity beyond health services and keep health (human, animal, and environmental) as the central focus (1, 2). Resilience in human and animal population health has clear benefits for the environment and the economy, at both national and global levels. Additionally, maintaining health is more ethical than facilitating recovery from illness (27). In many cases, isolated policies have contributed to ineffective responses to (emerging) infectious and non-communicable diseases. Health is essential for societal well-being, and many current health challenges are beyond the capacity of any one discipline or jurisdiction to meet. We need to embrace this and facilitate appropriate and sustained responses. For example, the emergence of infectious diseases, including zoonoses, and multidrug resistance is determined by variables including economic conditions, population changes (both humans and animals), and land use changes (29, 30). The consequences include changes in behavior and habits, as well as in intensification of production, trade, habitat change, loss of biodiversity, and globalization (24, 31). These in turn affect the economic conditions, population numbers, and land use, which emphasizes the co-evolutionary nature of these interactions. The long history of cohabitation between humans and animals suggests multiple synergistic effects. However, current trends lead to segregation of species in isolated habitats with complete loss of these synergies. The OH concept can shape this cohabitation, in a positive way, rather than being driven by fear and rejection. Ideas such as zoobiquity explore how animal–human commonalities can be used to diagnose, treat, and heal patients of all species, not just humans (32). The current challenge is to shape national, regional, and global institutions to facilitate these transdisciplinary processes and to provide methods to assess their level of integration as well as the evolution of the affected system. Health professionals have previously been at the forefront of social change, gradually making smoking and poor dietary habits increasingly unacceptable (6). It is now time to advocate for continuous adaptation of the underlying determinants of health, in particular interspecies equity, stewardship, and resilience to achieve a healthy and sustainable future for all.",

        "Dengue virus (serotypes DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4) is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. Mosquitoes transmitting DENV in humans has been a major cause of dengue diseases in tropical and subtropical counties; approximately one-third of the world's population is at risk of the infection. People infected with DENV typically show self-limited febrile dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is more likely to occur after a second DENV infection [1], [2]. Other than supportive treatments, no specific therapy is available for dengue-related diseases. Several tetravalent DENV vaccine candidates are under development, but an effective, safe and affordable dengue vaccine remains elusive [3].",
        "DENV infects multiple organs and cell types in humans. Particularly, the mononuclear phagocyte lineage of macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and skin Langerhans cells are the primary cell targets [4], [5], [6]. Similar cellular tropism of macrophages and DCs was observed in the experimental DENV mouse infection model [7]. Macrophages and DCs are the most crucial cell types in innate immunity and rapidly produce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to fight against microbe invasion. Type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of virus replication. Therefore, many pathogenic viruses have developed strategies to escape the IFN-triggered anti-viral effects. More than 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described [8]. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, an IFN stimulator, with its protease NS3/4A [9]. The nonstructural proteins NS4B of DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) block the activation of STAT1 in cells stimulated with type I IFN [10], [11].",
        "We previously found that two flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and DENV-2, trigger type I IFN transcription through an RIG-I-dependent signaling cascade to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-κB. However, JEV induced higher activation of IRF3 and NF-κB than DENV-2 in human A549 cells [12]. Furthermore, type I IFN production triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation was blocked in DENV-2-infected human DCs [13], [14]. Microarray results from rhesus macaques also indicated that type I IFN, interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were not upregulated with DENV-1 infection [15]. Therefore, DENV-2 might modulate the induction pathway of type I IFN and other cytokines.",
        "The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is one of the best-studied pattern-recognition receptor families and is responsible for sensing invading pathogens [16]. Different TLRs recognize the different molecular patterns of microorganisms; for example, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Engagement of TLRs with their ligands triggers signal cascades to activate IRFs and NF-κB, thus leading to production of cytokines and type I IFN [17]. NF-κB activation is crucial for cytokine induction, and many viruses evolve various strategies to manipulate NF-κB signaling [18], [19]. Several RNA virus-encoded proteins, such as HCV NS5B, SARS CoV M protein, measles virus V protein, and enterovirus 71 2C, inhibit NF-κB activation directly or indirectly [20], [21], [22], [23].",
        "In this study, we investigated whether DENV-2 could block type I IFN and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. We studied the influence of DENV-2 infection on activation of NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).",
        "The DENV-2 PL046 strain (Genbank accession: AJ968413.1) was isolated from a Taiwanese DF patient. The DENV-2 prototype New Guinea C (NGC) strain was kindly provided by D. J. Gubler of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. These viruses were propagated in the mosquito cell line C6/36 (ATCC: CRL-1660) grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [24]. The J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line (ATCC: TIB-67), A549 human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line (ATCC: CCL-185), and African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line Vero (ATCC: CCL-81) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The TLR3 ligand polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 1826 (CpG ODN 1826; hereafter CpG) were from InvivoGen. The TLR4 ligand LPS (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog# 9102 and 9101S) and anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.",
        "Female C57BL/6 mice at 6–8 weeks old were used in accordance with the guidelines of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital animal care and use committee under the approved animal study protocol (VGHKS-99-A028). BMDCs were generated by culturing bone-marrow hematopoietic cells with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) for 8 days [25], [26]. For DENV-2 infection, 106 DCs were adsorbed with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 1 h. After removing the virus inoculant, cells were incubated with complete medium. For stimulation with TLR ligands, DCs were incubated with 100 µg/ml polyI:C or 1 µg/ml CpG.",
        "TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA extraction, and cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 µg total RNA by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR amplification was done with 4 ng cDNA in 10 µl SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) with 3 µM of primers in the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Transcript levels were normalized to that of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The primer pairs were for IFN-β, 5′-GCTCCTGGAGCAGCTGAATG-3′ and 5′-CGTCATCTCCATAGGGATCTTGA-3′; IL-10, 5′-GATGCCCCAGGCAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CACCCAGGGAATTCAAATGC-3′; TNFα, 5′-CACAAGATGCTGGGACAGTGA-3′ and 5′-TCCTTGATGGTGGTGCATGA-3′; IL-12p40, 5′-ACAGCACCAGCTTCTTCATCAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCAAAGGCTTCATCTGCAA-3′; HPRT, 5′-GCTCGAGATGTCATGAAGGAGAT-3′ and 5′-AAAGAACTTATAGCCCCCCTTGA-3′; DENV-2 5′UTR\n5′- AGTTGTTAGTCTACGTGGACCGA-3′ and 5′-CGCGTTTCAGCATATTGAAAG-3′. The qPCR primers for TLRs are listed in Table S1.",
        "Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After 2 washes with PBS, cells were blocked with 10% skim milk in PBS. NF-κB p65 subcellular location was determined by immunostaining with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65, then Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen). DENV-2 NS3 was detected by a specific monoclonal antibody against NS3 (#YH3304, 1∶500 dilution, Yao-Hong Biotechnology) plus Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen). Fluorescence signals were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51).",
        "TurboFect transfection reagent (Fermentas) was used for transient transfection following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells cultured in 12-well plate were transfected with NF-κB- or IFN-β-Luc reporter plasmids [12], [25]. pRL-TK (Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase under an HSV thymidine kinase promoter, was used as an internal control. After transfection for 24 h, cells were infected with DENV-2; in some experiments, cells were further stimulated with LPS or polyI:C (both 1 µg/ml). Cell lysates were collected at the indicated times for dual-luciferase assays (Promega). Relative firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.",
        "Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Harvested cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were reacted with primary antibody, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and visualized with an enhance chemiluminescence system (Thermo). Images were acquired by a digital image system (UVP or Fujifilm).",
        "To study the effect of DENV-2 on modulating innate immune response, we determined the levels of type I IFN and cytokines in DENV-2–infected mouse BMDCs by quantitative RT-PCR. The TLR3 ligand polyI:C and the TLR9 ligand CpG greatly stimulated the mRNA expression of IFN-β (124-fold induction at 2 h by polyI:C and 531-fold induction at 6 h by CpG), IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG), IL-12p40 (381-fold at 24 h by polyI:C and 1551-fold at 6 h by CpG), and TNFα (64-fold at 2 h by polyI:C and 180-fold at 6 h by CpG) (Figure 1A–D, left panels). However, levels of IFN-β and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1, left and right panels): especially, IL-10 was not induced by DENV-2 infection. The kinetic of DENV-2 replication in BMDCs was measured by qPCR with primers specific for DENV-2 5′-UTR (Figure 1E) and by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure 1F). DENV-2 replication peaked around 12–24 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12–36 h post infection. Therefore, infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression and that of other cytokines. Since DENV-2 infection would produce intracellular viral RNA to turn on RLR and TLR signaling cascades for cytokine production, weak induction of DENV-2 for these cytokine genes (Figure 1) implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines.",
        "To determine whether DENV infection could suppress the cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling, we investigated infection with a murine macrophage cell line J774A.1. Consistent with previous report that J774A.1 is susceptible to DENV infection [27], DENV-2 infection in J774A.1 was shown by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure S1A), and by qPCR with DENV-2 5′ UTR primers (Figure S1B). J774A.1 cells were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2, then stimulated with LPS or polyI:C. LPS and polyI:C readily promoted the expression of IFN-β (Figure 2A and B; left panels) and IL-10 (Figure 2A and B right panels), but with DENV-2, the expression was diminished. Similar results were noticed in DENV-2-infected BMDCs that polyI:C-activated IFN-β and IL-10 were reduced with DENV-2 infection (Figure 2C). Thus, DENV-2 appears to interfere with IFN-β and cytokine production triggered by TLRs signaling cascade.",
        "NF-κB is an essential molecule in the TLR signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN-β and cytokines [16], [28], [29]. In our infection system, two strains of DENV-2, PL046 and NGC, triggered low degree of NFκB p65 nuclear translocation. Nuclear staining of p65 was noted in 7% and 13% of PL046- and NGC-infected cells, respectively (Figure S2A panels b and c); in contrast, about 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-κB p65 (Figure S2A, panel d). Thus, we checked whether DENV-2 could suppress NF-κB activation triggered by TLRs engagement. With use of a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, NF-κB activation stimulated by the TLR ligands LPS and polyI:C was readily blocked in DENV-2-infected cells at 12 and 24 h post stimulation (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting result of DENV-2 NS3 indicated that the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment (Figure 3B). As well, DENV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-κB activation in Vero cells as measured by nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (Figure 4A); similar results were also observed in J774A.1 macrophages (Figure S2B). Nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was slightly increased in A549 cells up to 60 h post DENV-2 infection, but the polyI:C-triggered p65 nuclear translocation was greatly blocked in DENV-2 infected cells (Figure S2C). We also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication, polyI:C pretreatment blocked DENV-2 replication; whereas, the antiviral effect of polyI:C was not seen in cells with established DENV-2 infection (Figure 4B). This data is consistent with previous report [30] and suggest that DENV-2 inhibits TLR signaling to benefit its replication. DENV-2 replication in these two cell lines, A549 and Vero, was confirmed by qPCR with viral 5′ UTR primers and plaque assay for virion production (Figure S3). Thus, DENV-2 downregulates TLR-activated NF-κB, which leads to reduced cytokine expression.",
        "The activity of ERK is associated with the expression of type I IFN and cytokines, particularly IL-10 [31], [32], [33]. We thus further checked whether DENV-2 targets ERK activation by examining the phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK). DENV-2 infection did not activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and even impaired the basal level of p-ERK1/2 (Figure 5A). Furthermore, polyI:C- and LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was decreased with DENV-2 infection (Figure 5B and 5C), so DENV blocks TLR-mediated ERK activation to modulate both arms of the innate immunity response to infection: type I IFN and cytokines.",
        "The pathogenesis mechanism of severe DHF/DSS with DENV infection is not well understood, but evidence suggests that the magnitude of DENV replication and its regulation of innate and adaptive immunity may both contribute [34]. The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1]. Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35], [36], [37]. In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNFα were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2-infected BMDCs. Furthermore, even in the absence of enhancing antibody, DENV could block NF-κB activation and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. Downregulation of the cytokine system may provide a growth advantage for DENV to propagate in host macrophages and DCs.",
        "IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressor produced by several immune cells [38], and its expression can be triggered by TLR [31], [32]. IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions caused by the host immune system responding to infections [39], [40]. DHF patients showed high serum levels of IL-10, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [41], [42]. In a WNV animal infection model, IL-10 downregulated T cell-mediated immunity and had a negative role in antiviral immunity [43]. Thus, our findings that DENV-2 failed to induce IL-10 expression in BMDCs (Figure 1) are unexpected but are consistent with previous reports that IL-10 is not produced from mature human CD1a+ DCs infected with DENV-2 [44], [45] and that microarray data from DENV-1-infected rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes [15]. In addition, we found that DENV-2 could inhibit TLR-triggered IL-10 expression. Therefore, the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be simply stimulated by the DENV itself. Instead, it may be resulted from uncontrolled DENV replication, which then triggers increased levels of immune activation and increased IL-10 production. DENV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system and results in increased DENV production [35], [37], [45]. Thus, DENV infection via ADE or non-ADE routes might have different effects in the immune system.",
        "TLR signaling cascades are mainly controlled by the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, which both lead to activation of NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [17], [46]. NF-κB and MAPKs have been suggested to have critical roles in cytokine induction [47], [48]. A recent study showed that constitutive intestinal NF-κB activation does not lead to destructive inflammation unless accompanied by activation of MAPKs such as p38 and ERK [49]. Our results that DENV-2 blocked activation of NF-κB, as well as ERK1/2, support our findings of cytokine production hampered in DENV-2-infected cells. Because both NFκB and ERK1/2 were affected, DENV may suppress an upstream molecular event such as TLR gene expression, as that has been reported for DENV infection through an ADE route [37]. We also detected TLR genes expression in DENV-2 infected J774A.1 macrophages and found that polyI:C-triggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2 (Figure S4, panels a–c), but not for that of TRL6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR2 (Figure S4, panels d–g). In contrast, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation (Figure S4, panels h–i), suggesting that DENV-2 may modulate certain TLR genes expression in macrophage. Other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN-β promoter activation [13], may target common molecules involved in type I IFN and cytokine production in TLR signaling, or whether ISG15 that is induced by DENV-2 and functions as an inhibitor of type I IFN production [50] may also contribute to immune evasion, remain to be further studied.",
        "Taiwanese DENV-2 strain PL046 used in this study was isolated from patient with DF, and this virus has been used in the studies of viral pathogenesis and host responses mechanism in vitro and in vivo\n[7], [12], [51], [52], [53]. Other groups have reported that DENV-2 strains MON601 (a laboratory strain of NGC) and 16681 downregulate the activation of NF-κB and production of type I IFN and TNFα in human DC, macrophage, and Huh7 cells [14], [54]. A recent report by Chase A. J. et al. [55] also revealed that human DCs infected with several endemic DENV-2 strains failed to polarize the naïve CD4+ T cells to effectors, suggesting a defect on T cell priming for DENV-infected DCs [55]. However, one of the strain ARA6894 did not show such kind of inhibition effect, as ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4+ Th1 polarization with high expression of IFNγ and TNFα. Interestingly, the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains such as PL046, 16681 and NGC [55], suggesting that different impacts on DC's function between these DENV-2 strains might be due to viral genome diversity.",
        "Dengue may be the most important arboviral disease potentially affecting 2 to 3 billion people living in tropical and subtropical areas. DENV mainly infects monocytes, macrophages and DCs that are also the most important innate immune cells. The balance between the protective and pathological immune responses likely contributes to the DENV infection outcomes. Our results demonstrating that DENV can modulate the signaling events triggered by several TLRs are of interest and provide an explanation for how DENV may skew the host immune system."
