Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators). These risk factors will also have implications for workforce allocation (e.g., assignment of healthcare providers with specific risk factors to positions with reduced risk of exposure to .\", \"To date, several studies have reported that a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and traditional CVD risk factors, e.g., age, male sex, current smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, are associated with severe COVID-19. However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.\", \".

We confirmed a robust association of age and male sex with severe COVID-19. Their contributions are likely to be independent of each other. A few studies demonstrated positive associations of current smoking with severe COVID-19. Several studies reported that pre-existing CVD, hypertension, and diabetes were also associated with severe COVID-19. However, only two studies that reported estimates for these comorbidities adjusted for age and/or sex. One study found that the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19 was no longer statistically significant after age adjustment, 25 whereas the other showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in analyses that adjusted for age and a few other comorbidities. 17 Although the primary estimate was not statistically significant, our metaregression analyses indicated some degree of confounding by age, but not necessarily by sex, for the associations of hypertension, diabetes, and prior CVD with severe COVID-19.\", \"The positive association of sociodemographic factors (age, male sex, and smoking) with severe COVID-19 is consistent with reports of other infectious diseases (e.g., influenza virus and SARS in 2003). [27] [28] [29] There are several plausible mechanisms. Older age is linked to reduced immune reaction, more comorbidities, and limited organ reserve. 3, 27, 30 Male sex is related to higher prevalence of comorbidities, less frequency of washing hands, and immunological disadvantage given X-chromosome coding proteins in the immune system, 2,31,32 whereas smoking can damage respiratory system. 33 In our meta-analysis, we confirmed overall positive crude associations of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes with severe COVID-19, with pooled relative risk estimates around 3-.

An important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders, particularly age. Although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models, our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age. One study by Zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19. On the other hand, Liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1,590 patients. These is also biologic plausibility. Hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for CVD and kidney diseases, and there is evidence that COVID-19 damages these organs. 34, 35 Available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of COVID-19 infection. As noted above, there is biological plausibility for potential associations of COVID-19 with hypertension and diabetes, two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use. 13 In this study, ~30% of patients reported prevalent hypertension, but only ~5% of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. 13 Thus, it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available. 4 Our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making. While the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe COVID-19 complicates this process, data on case fatality rates from three countries (Web Table 2 ) suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe COVID-19 (relative risk > ~5 compared to <50 years). Our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of ~1.7. Although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of ~3-3.5 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD overestimate their impact beyond age and sex, all or some of them may each confer 1.5-2 times greater risk. Thus, using these factors, it is possible to estimate, at least crudely, the risk of severe COVID-19. For example, a man aged 60-65 years old, with either hypertension, diabetes, or prior CVD would .

Such information could be used to inform decisions on testing for COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19, and workforce planning.\", \"Our study has some limitations. First, reflecting the fact that the outbreak started from China, most studies were from China. However, given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries, it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable. Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors (e.g., ~25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs. women in China 36 ) and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable. Second, we did not include non-English publications. Third, most studies reported odds ratios, which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high. Fourth, we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the China CDC report 14 and other Chinese studies. Nonetheless, the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the China CDC data (data not shown). Finally, the literature of COVID-19 is growing rapidly, and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication. On the other hand, our systematic review has several strengths: in-depth review of CVD and its risk factors, a clinically relevant definitions of severe COVID-19 that minimize subjective reporting, meta-regression to explore potential confounding, and relatively short elapsed time of ~2 weeks between the literature search and manuscript submission.\", \"In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis found robust associations of older age and male sex as risk factors of severe COVID-19.

Province, China, the novel virus infection has rapidly spread to other cities in China, and has now been detected in 186 countries and locations internationally [1] . On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genetic sequence [2] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3] [4] . With the escalated spread of the infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5] [6] .

Some evidence suggests that pre-existing medical conditions are likely death risk factors for COVID- 19 . For example, a study based on 72,314 cases in China indicated that the case-fatality rate (CFR) tends to be higher among those with older age, and having pre-existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension compared to all the patients [9] .

Median ages were similar to mean ages in both groups. A majority (62.9%) of the patients were male. Overall, 25.5% of the total patients had clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 before January 11 th , 2020. A relatively small proportion of the total sample had COPD, renal failure, history of surgery and hepatic failure (4.4%, 4.4%, 3.6% or 1.1%). Among all preexisting comorbidities with over 5% of the total sample, hypertension was the most common (39.6%), followed by diabetes (26.2%), CHD (14.5%), cardiac failure (8%), cerebral infarction (6.9%) and chronic bronchitis (6.9%). Patients in the case group had more CHD (p<0.001) and more cerebral infarction (p=0.05), compared to those in the control group. A majority of the total sample had at least one pre-existing comorbidity (67.6%), specifically around 25% had one, 22% had two, 11% had three, and 10% had four or more.

Table 2 presents the results of univariate and multivariate weighted Cox models. Older age was associated with significantly higher death risk with similar magnitude in univariate and multivariate models. In the adjusted model, every 5-year increase in age was associated with an estimated 20% higher risk of death (p<0.001). No significant hazard difference was found between male and female patients. Disease infection during the early no-intervention period was associated with a higher risk of death, although not statistically significant.\", \"The increasing number of cumulative comorbidities was associated with higher mortality risk in both unadjusted and adjusted models (p<0.001).

After adjusting for age, gender, and early period of pandemic in China, CHD was the only comorbidity that yielded a significant death risk: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD had an estimated 2.9 times death risk of those without CHD. In addition, cerebral infarction, COPD, and renal failure all had an estimated HR of around 2.0, respectively. Similar results were observed by using unweighted logistic regression in a sensitivity analysis (Appendix Table A2 ).\", \"The overall median follow-up was 40 days, during which 94 deaths were observed. \", \"In this paper, we used survival analysis to estimate the fatal risk of pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19, based on publicly reported confirmed cases and adjusted for the confounding effect of age, gender, and early period of the pandemic when no-intervention was taken. There were three major findings: First, a history of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% increase of death risk (p<0.001). Second, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was the only significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Patients with CHD had a 200% higher risk of mortality in COVID-19, compared to patients without CHD (p<0.001). For a patient profile (65-\", \"year-old female without other comorbidities), the estimated median survival times for those with CHD was 34 days, while it was over 70 days for those without CHD (p<0.001). Third, older age was associated with increased death risk. Specifically, every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).\", \"To our best knowledge, the present study is the first to provide substantial statistical evidence to show the effect of CHD in predicting mortality for COVID-19.

It is worth pointing out that the existing studies [9, 16] that investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression that does not control for potential confounders. In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offers more survivaltime-related information to help guide the clinical intervention and more statistical power to detect risk factors [33] [34] .\", \"Previous studies have indicated that cardiovascular events following pneumonia may increase the risk of mortality [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , which explained our findings from the point view of pathophysiological mechanisms. One potential mechanism underlying the association between pneumonia and cardiovascular events is inflammation [38] . Specifically, the inflammatory reaction following pneumonia can result in plague instability and damage in the blood vessels, where evidence of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary arteries following acute systemic infections have been shown in many studies [38, 40] . Thus, infections may result in heightened loading imposed on cardiomyocytes, and lead to sympathetic hyperactivity, ischemia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia and heart failure in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD [37] .\", \"Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research, potentially prospective studies, are needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing CHD may influence the survival probability among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to implement early medical interventions and decrease the mortality risk. We suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patients with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had preexisting heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention may be needed [41] .\", \"Furthermore, our results indicated that the hazard of COVID-19 death was significantly higher in patients at older ages. Adjusting for others, every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 22% increased risk of death, similarly to what was found in previous studies [8, 9, 16] .\", \"Alongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra care is needed for those with CHD, especially for elderly patients.\", \"The design of excluding patients from Hubei Province was based on the concerns of unknown confounders caused by insufficient medical resources in the epicenter.

Therefore, analyzing patient data outside of Hubei Province can avoid the competing death risk caused by insufficient health care resources, and reveal the true underlying impact of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality [44] .\", \"One limitation of the present study lies in the nature of publicly reported data.\", \"Researchers have pointed out that severe cases may be over-represented in publicly reported data [45] . Nevertheless, we have managed to reduce the potential bias caused by severe case overrepresentation, through the appropriate matching between cases and controls in NCC design. The auto-matching procedure via statistical program also prevented the possibility of tendentiously selecting survivors with comorbidity-free history during data collection. In addition, NCC design is favored in our situation where the risk factor data and event of interest can be identified opportunistically from publicly reported confirmed cases [30] . Therefore, NCC was the optimal choice, given the restricted availability of public data.\", \"In conclusion, our findings provided preliminary yet strong evidence supporting the association between pre-existing CHD and mortality risk for patients with COVID-19. Based on our findings, close monitoring, extra care, and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing CHD, to reduce the mortality risk associated with COVID-19.\", \"The authors have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial or non-financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The serum AST level over 29.5 U/L and CRP over 37.3 mg/L showed relative moderate accuracy with AUC = 0.9231 and AUC = 0.9292.

Although the clinical characteristics of patients enrolled were somewhat akin to those reported in previous studies (1, 5, 7) , there were no differences in age, BMI, and proportion with underlying diseases between severe and non-severe patients, as well as smoking history. In concert with recent studies (1, 5, 9) , we found that the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 mimic those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms, and both groups had similar days from symptom onset, similar maximum temperature, and number of patients who had dyspnea. APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated based on admission data. PSI, CURB-65, and the semiquantitative score were used to assess the severity of lung damage.\", \"Significantly higher scores were found in severe cases.\", \"Among the risk factors we investigated in this study, we surprisingly discovered that LDH had the most positive relationship between both PSI and CT score. In addition, it was also most positively relevant to APACHE II and SOFA scores, which reflected a strong correlation between LDH with lung damage as well as disease severity. LDH is a major player in glucose metabolism which is present in tissues throughout the body and catalyzes pyruvate to lactate. It is released from cells upon damage of their cytoplasmic membrane (10) . Previous studies also had noted the importance of LDH as an indicator of lung diseases. In a study on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), researchers found that EBV infected B cells had more LDH transcripts than the uninfected B cells (11) . In addition, the serum levels of LDH increased in PcP patients, probably was due to lung injury (12, 13) . Among patients who were infected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 77.8% whose laboratory test showed LDH > 225U/L had lung involvement, without difference between adult and children (14) , which indicated that LDH elevation was associated with various pathogen including virus, and was relevant to lung injury.\", \"Furthermore, there was a case reported in 2017 that a patient with human Zika virus infection had markedly elevated LDH, which was associated with 70% mortality in All rights reserved.

They considered LDH as an indicator of multiorgan injury, not only affecting liver or cardiac function(15).\", \"LDH is found in all human cells, especially in myocardial and liver cells. In our study, LDH elevation was positively associated with AST, cTnI and BNP, which verified it as an isozyme of heart and liver. However, it was somewhat surprising that cTnI was neither associated with PSI nor CT semiquantitative score, while was relevant with disease severity. Similarly, BNP that had a strong correlation with APACHE II and SOFA, was not associated with CT semiquantitative score, either. Furthermore, AST which was associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score, was not related to PSI score. This rather intriguing finding might be explained by the fact that the myocardial and liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the direct damage of the virus to targeted organs, while not because of hypoxia induced by lung injury. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, structural analysis of the virus has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans(16, 17). The ACE2 receptor is abundantly present in the epithelia of lung and small intestine(18), which might provide possible routes of entry for SARS-CoV-2.\", \"This epithelial expression, together with its presence in vascular endothelium(18), also provides a step in understanding the pathogenesis of ARDS, cardiac injury, liver injury and even MODS.\", \"Furthermore, LDH was found to be positively associated with CRP and negatively with\", \"lymphocytes. An increase in CRP and decrease in lymphocytes were observed in severe cases during the 14-day observation period, which was consistent with findings of recent reports (1, 5, 6) . In our study, the development of lymphopenia in severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells, but not to B cells or NK cells. The decrease of T cells in severe cases reached its trough within three days, and then slightly increased from the first week while still maintaining low levels and not recovering to the level of nonsevere patients over two weeks (data not shown).\", \"All rights reserved.

Suppression of LDH has anti-inflammatory effects due to the downregulation of several inflammatory mediators including cytokines and NO(23).\", \"Also, significant correlations were found between LDH and cytokines/chemokines, therefore, LDH may be a useful biomarker to assist the clinician in the decision to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis(24). In our study, lymphocytes, especially CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells were significantly decreased and relevant with LDH elevation.\", \"The decrease in T cell counts was strongly correlated with the severity of disease, which was in keeping with previous studies on SARS(25, 26). On the other hand, elevation of LDH, the immune-related factor, could be considered as a predictive factor, that reflected a poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients.\", \"Our study had some limitations. This study was conducted at a single-center with limited sample size. Furthermore, because many patients remained in hospital and outcomes were unknown at the time of writing, we only collected clinical data within two weeks for our analysis.

(14) As a result, the CDC lists moderate to severe asthma as a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.(14) However, to date the literature is ambiguous on whether pre-existing asthma increases the risk of either COVID-19 infection, or morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19, in children.\", \"The evidence on COVID-19 risk factors derives largely from the adult population. Four case series, all from Wuhan, China, of adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19 did not list asthma as an underlying pre-existing condition in any of those patients.(12,15, 16, 17) In a large case series of 1099 adult patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, asthma was not listed as a pre-existing condition in any of the patients described.(18) In contrast, recent data released from the CDC of U.S. hospitalizations in March,2020 notes that 27.3% of adults 18-49 years of age who were hospitalized with COVID-19 had a history of asthma.(3) In adults aged 50-64 years of age hospitalized for COVID-19 asthma was present in 13.2% and in those 65 years or older asthma was present in 12.9%.(3,19) As a result, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) notes that ‘those with asthma in the 18-49 year old age range may be at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19.’(19)\", \"Although there is a paucity of literature on pediatric risk factors, the case series to date from Wuhan on hospitalized pediatric cases don’t list asthma as a pre-existing risk factor for morbidity or mortality.(10,11) It is further reassuring that children appear to be at lower risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than the adult population in general, although severe infection still can occur.(13,20) The CDC morbidity and mortality report notes that among the 149,082 reported U.S. cases of COVID-19 for which age is known, only 2572 (1.7%) occurred in children 18 years and younger.(3) Although among the patients with information on underlying conditions, 23% had at least one underlying condition such as asthma, only 5.7% of children infected with COVID-19 required hospitalization (compared with 10% of adults aged 18-64 years) and only 3 deaths were reported in children (<1% of pediatric cases).

There is minimal literature on this risk from COVID-19, but there are data on the risk of asthma exacerbations triggered from other coronavirus infections, with mixed findings. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, did not cause an increase in asthma exacerbations in children during the 2002 epidemic, nor induce bronchial hyperreactivity or eosinophilic inflammation.(22) In fact, paradoxically, asthma exacerbations actually decreased during that time, which was attributed to improvements in hygiene measures related to the epidemic.(22) However, in contrast, non-epidemic coronaviruses are found commonly in the respiratory tracts of children with an asthma exacerbation and have contributed to bronchial hyper-reactivity and eosinophilic inflammation.(23, 24, 25, 26)\", \"In summary, based on available information to date, it is unclear whether there is a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity among asthmatic children.(8,9) It is also unknown whether asthma medications such as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or asthma biological therapies pose a risk in managing COVID-19 infections. Before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, larger scale data are required from pediatric populations, and from heterogeneous locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. It also remains unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of asthma exacerbations. As a result, good asthma control is essential as a precautionary measure during this time.(8,9,13,20)\", \"In addition to the current burden of COVID-19, the spring season is often a time for asthma exacerbations due to emergence of seasonal aeroallergens, and other respiratory viruses.(27) The best way to prevent an exacerbation is consistent proper use of medicines to control asthma, such as inhaled corticosteroids and/or montelukast. As a result, children should remain on their current asthma medications during COVID-19.(8,9) This recommendation is supported by multiple international organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control, the Global Initiative for Asthma, and the North American consensus guideline on allergy care during COVID.(8,9,28,29) It is recommended that children not ‘step down’ any controller medication during this time unless ‘this is clearly favorable from an individual standpoint, with careful consideration of the balance between benefit and harm/burden.’(8) Other recommendations to maintain asthma control include avoiding known asthma triggers such as aeroallergens, frequent handwashing, physical distancing, and regular review of inhaler technique.(9,29) An exacerbation, if it occurred, ‘could require [children] to enter the healthcare system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.’(8)\", \"Some biologic agents, such as omalizumab (anti-IgE) and mepolizumab (anti-IL5), are approved for use in moderate to severe asthma in adolescents(30) The current recommendation for adolescents who are using these medications is to continue their use.(8) There is no current evidence that use of these medications increases the risk of COVID-19 infection or morbidity.\", \"If a child is using a nebulized asthma relief medication, this should be switched to a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (turbuhaler or diskus) under most circumstances.(8,9) Nebulization increases the risk of viral lower lung deposition.(8,9,31) It also increases the risk of infection transmission due to both stimulating a cough reflex, as well as generating ‘a high volume of respiratory aerosols that may be propelled over a longer distance than is involved in a natural dispersion pattern.’(31) It was poignantly noted in a recent editorial that ‘there is a possibility that nebulizer therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection can transmit potentially viable coronavirus to susceptible bystander hosts.’(31) The only possible reasons for a child to use a nebulizer at home during the COVID-19 pandemic are a poor response to a MDI/spacer, a child who is either uncooperative or unable to follow the directions required for MDI use, or medication shortages (which are discussed in more detail below).(8,9,31)\", \"The CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended against oral corticosteroid (OCS) use as a treatment for COVID-19.(32,33) This recommendation is based on experience with influenza, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), where OCS use prolonged viral replication and was associated with prolonged viral clearance, increased complication rates, increased risk of mechanical ventilation and higher mortality rates.(34, 35, 36, 37) It has been noted that OCS therapy increases the risk of nosocomial infection and secondary infection.(38) However, there is a distinction between OCS use as a therapy for COVID-19, and OCS use as a treatment of asthma exacerbations.(8) There is broad consensus that asthma exacerbations should be treated aggressively and in keeping with current guideline recommendations.(9) Multiple national and international organizations such as the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend OCS use as required, and in keeping with the child’s asthma action plan, during COVID-19.(8,9,28)\", \"The use of nebulized medications are especially discouraged in a healthcare setting, where infection transmission to other vulnerable patients is a risk.(9,31) If used, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is required. It must also be considered that nebulized viral droplets can persist in the air for hours.(39)\", \"For any child with asthma who is having progressive or worsening symptoms, COVID-19 screening protocols must be used to help determine their level of risk as well as the need for COVID-19 testing at an appropriate facility.(8)\", \"For children hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation either documented or suspected to be associated with COVID-19 that is progressing, it might be decided to use one of the agents currently being considered in adults, for example, hydroxychloroquine.(40,41) or to seek compassionate release of remdesivir. There is no current data on the safety and efficacy of these agents in children and thus should be discussed in the setting of the hospital policy.(42,43) Although dosage of these medications in adolescents may be similar to adults, the appropriate adjustment for children under 12 years remains to be defined.\", \"\\nMedication shortages. There is a growing medication shortage across North America, including asthma medications such as albuterol.(39) In many cases, such as with albuterol, these medications increasingly are being used in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to help with respiratory issues. To help combat the shortage of albuterol specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic albuterol inhaler on April 8,2020.(44) If faced with albuterol shortage, other available options include substituting other short acting beta-agonists, using an expired albuterol inhaler, and ensuring good asthma control which reduces the need for reliever medications in general.(9,39) Many of the substitute short acting beta-agonists are dry powder inhalers (diskus or turbuhaler) and as such children often need to be at least 6 years of age to produce enough inspiratory force to use these devices properly.(9,45) For adolescents 12 years and older, another option is ICS-formoterol for both maintenance and relief therapy as supported by the Global Initiative for Asthma 2019 update.(46,47) Nebulized albuterol should only be considered as a last resort, and proper infection prevention protocols need to be followed.(8,9,31) If no other medications are available, epinephrine inhalers might be considered as well, if used prudently.\", \"\\nVirtual visits. With the need for significant healthcare resource reallocation, as well as shortages of PPE, much of the allergy/immunology specialty has converted to largely virtual visits, or visit deferral, during COVID-19.(8) Due to the need for almost exclusively virtual visits at this time, having a peak flow meter in homes may be helpful to diagnose an acute exacerbation at home, by comparing baseline measurements with those during highly symptomatic times. There are several advantages to virtual visits, including access to specialists, removing the transportation barrier required for an in-person visit, allowing those too sick to travel to connect with a healthcare provider, and most importantly in the current context, prevention of infection transmission with in-person visits.(48)\", \"Virtual visits should be prioritized for children who have poorly controlled asthma, have worsening asthma symptoms, or who have required dose escalations of their asthma medications in the past several months’ time.(8) It is recommended that follow-up visits for children with mild-to-moderate or well-controlled asthma be postponed during COVID-19, or converted to virtual visits if time permits.(8) It also is recommended that children of any asthma severity who have been well controlled for the past 6-12 months (no ER visits, <1 OCS dose, <2 exacerbations in the past 6-12 months) have visits deferred or converted to virtual visits (time permitting).(8) For children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations, an in-person visit likely is necessary but as noted in the joint North American guideline on COVID-19 and allergy contingency planning, ‘If the allergy/ immunology office does not have PPE available, it would be recommended that no patients with a co-potential for an asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 be seen at that office; the patient should instead be seen at another facility capable of COVID-19 isolation which is staffed and equipped to assess and manage asthma.’(8) Recommendations may be adjusted over time, based on the duration of COVID-19 and the time required for physical distancing.\", \"\\nAsthma Clinical Trials. It is currently recommended that entry into any asthma clinical trial be suspended during COVID-19.(8) For asthmatic children already participating in clinical trials, consideration could be given to virtual visits if possible.(8) Procedures that require forced expiratory maneuvers such as spirometry, methacholine challenge or induced sputum samples should be postponed in order to minimize staff risk and potential room contamination. Medication withdrawal as part of research protocols also should be deferred to a later time. Consideration should be given to telephone or telemedicine visits in order to limit exposure to a medical setting.\", \"\\nImpact of Social Determinants of Health on Asthma and COVID-19. There are many social determinants of health that have an impact on pediatric asthma morbidity including caregiver income, physical environment including exposure to second-hand smoke, access to health services, and race/ethnicity.(49, 50, 51) There is likely an interplay between some of these social determinants of health and the impact of COVID-19 on children with asthma. It has been suggested that exposure to second-hand smoke increases COVID-19 morbidity.(52,53) Of those hospitalized in the US for COVID-19, data from the CDC indicates that 33.1% were non-Hispanic black, while they only make up 18% of the catchment area population.(3) A recent editorial notes that low-income families are at higher risk of COVID-19 as low income jobs mostly can’t be performed remotely, often don’t pay sick days, are often not associated with insurance benefits and as a result it may not be possible for these families to afford the steps necessary for physical distancing.(54)\", \"Although the relationships between these variables needs to be further elucidated, it is possible that measures that impact social determinants of health, such as reducing exposure to second-hand smoke or improving healthcare access in low income neighborhoods, may improve prognosis in children with asthma who contract COVID-19. In addition, these families could benefit from counseling on having the appropriate amount of medications available for home during this period of restricted travel. In addition, they should check medications to be sure that none is expired.\", \"\\nImpact of COVID Restrictions. It is possible that children may not be severely affected by SARS-CoV-2 for some undefined reason to date, but they can still be carriers and could transmit virus to vulnerable people, including elderly relatives. Therefore, social distancing has included children, which has necessitated discontinuing school. It remains to be determined what impact this step has on children including those children with asthma. Often parents will discontinue medications in children during the summer months because they are doing well and they are out of school.(55) However, this year is different, because school was discontinued during the spring season, a time of seasonal allergen exacerbation and viral infection. School adds a certain structure to the day and there is some level of administration of asthma medication administration around the school day. Clinicians and parents should observe for potential breakdowns in adherence to controlling medications, especially in families in chaotic circumstances. The impact on education of home schooling, especially in families that lack an organizational structure remains to be seen. Finally, it has been suggested that school closure will increase the risk of childhood obesity, a known risk factor for worsening asthma.(56) Whether this occurs, and how this influences asthma control, also is yet unknown.\", \"In the face of unchartered territory and unprecedented times, there remains much to be learned about the impact of pediatric asthma on the course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Although adult data suggest that asthma is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality such a risk in children is unclear. Differentiating COVID-19 from worsening asthma, or an asthma exacerbation, is challenging. As a result, pediatricians and families have an essential role in ensuring that children with asthma maintain good asthma control during this time. Children and adolescents with asthma should remain on their current asthma medications and practice physical distancing, regular handwashing, and aeroallergen avoidance. Treatment of asthma exacerbations should include oral corticosteroids if required. Nebulized medications are not recommended at this time due to increased risk of viral transmission. Healthcare providers should remain alert for changing policies and recommendations knowledge advances.\", \"\\n30..\"],\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"sciwingI2B2\": {\n        \"0,0\": \"problem\",\n

(COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020 [1]. Preliminary data suggests that obesity may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19 [2]. Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) [3], formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may translate to a greater risk from respiratory diseases [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. It is currently not known whether MALFD patients are also more likely to have greater COVID-19 severity of illness. This study investigated the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity.\", \"We consecutively enrolled 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China (the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital, and Ruian People's Hospital) between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria [3]. Sixty six COVID-19 patients with MAFLD were included in the analyses and were divided into two groups [those with obesity (n = 45) and those without (n = 21)]. All patients received standard treatment based on the COVID-19 Management Guidance (7th edition) [8]. This study was approved by the local ethics review boards of all three hospitals. The requirement for written informed consent was waived for use of the de-identified data.\", \"COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the management guideline [8]. Blood routine markers were analyzed at the central laboratory of respective hospital using standard methods by VITROS 5600 Integrated Immunodiagnostic System (VITROS 5600, Johnson, New Jersey, USA).\", \"We collected demographic information and past medical history from all patients. Laboratory parameters were tested on the first day of hospital admission. Body weight and height were measured by trained examiners on admission. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Obesity was defined as BMI >25 kg/m2 [9]. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were diagnosed based on established criteria [10]. All patients denied a history of chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.\", \"Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD and compared using either the Student's t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between categorical variables was examined with the chi-squared test or the Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The association between obesity (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) among MAFLD patients was assessed by binary logistic regression. Statistical analyses were two-sided and significance was set at p < .05. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).\", \"The mean age of enrolled patients was 47 years and 74.2% were female. Table 1\\nshows the main clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with MAFLD stratified by obesity status. Mean BMI for the non-obese and obese patients were 22.7 ± 2.1 kg/m2 and 28.3 ± 3.2 kg/m2, respectively. Compared with the non-obese group, obese patients had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol, and lower lymphocyte counts. Notably, MALFD patients that were obese had more severe COVID-19 disease (37.5% vs. 9.5%, p = .021).\", \"As shown in Supplementary Table, there were 47 (71.2%) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 (28.8%) with severe COVID-19. Compared to those with non-severe COVID-19, patients with severe disease were more obese (89.5% vs. 59.6%, p = .021). They were also more likely to be smokers (26.3% vs. 6.4%, p = .038), and had higher C-reactive protein concentrations (median 52.7 [IQR 33.5–74.9] vs. 18.3 [4.6–24.9], p < .001) and lower lymphocyte counts (median 1.0 [IQR 0.8–1.2] vs. 1.4 [1.1–1.7], p = .005).\", \"As shown in Table 2\\n, in the unadjusted logistic regression model with COVID-19 severity as the outcome, the presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~ 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19–27.91, p = .029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95%CI 1.16–34.54, p = .033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.\", \"Our results show that in MAFLD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the presence of obesity markedly increases the risk of having severe illness. This association remained significant after adjusting for likely confounders.\", \"We reported previously that obesity is associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk for severe COVID-19 with a dose-effect relationship between increasing BMI and the proportion of patients with severe illness [11]. In the current analysis, the risk of severe illness in MAFLD patients with co-existing obesity was >6-fold greater after adjustment for confounders. These findings are distinct, suggesting that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in those with MAFLD. However, the virological and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship we observed is not clarified by the present data. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, a common complication in severe COVID-19 [12], is promoted by the activation of CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes producing a larger amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. This suggests IL-6 is a key proinflammatory factor that triggers the inflammatory “storm” in patients [13]. In MAFLD patients, particularly those with obesity, increased inflammatory activity in the liver and visceral fat is independently correlated with increased levels of IL-6 [14], which might have an additive/synergistic role in promoting greater severity of COVID-19. It is conceivable that the secretion of hepatokines for example, reduced adiponectin or the altered secretion of inflammatory lipid mediators in obese patients with MAFLD [15], may also contribute to the current observations.\", \"While this is the first multi-center study to investigate obesity as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness in patients with MAFLD, some limitations should be recognized. Patients included in our study did not undergo liver biopsy, thus COVID-19 severity in relation to liver histology could not be assessed. Waist circumference, a risk factor for MAFLD, was not measured in our patients, which precluded adjustment of this confounder. In addition, patients were of Asian ethnicity and thus the applicability of the results to other ethnic groups is uncertain. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the underlying mechanisms for why the association with obesity is greater in those with MAFLD.\", \"In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.\", \"Study concept and design: Kenneth I.

A number of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality are known, including age, sex, and a number of chronic conditions and laboratory findings [ 2 ] . Recently, a study on COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China discovered associations between ABO blood types and infection [ 3 ] . Their analysis compared blood groups between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the general populations of Wuhan and Shenzhen City, as assessed by previously-published samples of healthy individuals. They found that the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 among A blood groups was increased and among O blood groups was decreased relative to the general population. Similarly, previous work has identified associations between ABO blood groups and a number of different infections or disease severity following infections, including SARS-CoV- 1 [ 4 ] , P. falciparum [ 5 ] , H. pylori [ 6 ] , Norwalk virus [ 7 ], hepatitis B virus [ 8 ] , and N. gonorrhoeae [ 9 ] .\", \"Within the United States, New York City has become a major center of the pandemic, with over 64,000 cases and over 2,400 deaths as of April 5, 2020 [ 10 ] . We sought to replicate and extend the previous investigation into the association between COVID-19 and blood type using electronic health record data from New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) hospital in New York, USA. We compared both ABO and ABO+Rh blood types, and we investigated three COVID-19 outcomes: infection status, intubation, and death. We performed a multivariate analysis of our results to evaluate potential confounding due to risk factors, and we meta-analyzed our results in combination with data from China. This study is approved by the IRB (#AAAL0601).\", \"Throughout our analysis, individuals with a single positive SARS-CoV-2 lab test are considered COV+, even if they had previous or subsequent negative tests. Blood group was identified using either a measurement of LOINC code 34474-7, \\\"ABO and Rh group [Type] in Cord blood,\\\" or the results of a procedure identified by one of the names listed in Table 4 . We excluded individuals with multiple contradictory blood group measurements.\", \"We compared blood groups (defined both as ABO and ABO+Rh) and COVID-19 outcomes using four pairs of populations: COV+ vs COV-, COV+ vs general population (excluding those tested for COVID-19), COV+/Intubated vs COV+/Not intubated, and COV+/Deceased vs COV+/Alive. For each of the eight test conditions (2 blood group definitions and 4 outcome comparison population pairs), we performed a Pearson's Chi-squared test to test whether blood group distributions differ between the compared populations. Additionally, we compared each blood group against all others using a 2x2 contingency table to determine effect sizes for each blood group itself. For the one-vs-rest blood group comparisons, we report odds ratios (OR), p-values from Fisher's exact test (two-sided), and odds ratio confidence intervals.\", \"We evaluated the confounding effect of risk factors (age, sex, overweight status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, and cardiovascular diseases) on associations between blood group and COVID-19 outcomes. Since these analyses were performed at the individual level, we only considered COV+ vs COV-, COV+/Intubated vs COV+/Not intubated, and COV+/Died vs COV+/Alive, leaving out the COV+ vs general population comparison. Risk factor phenotypes were assigned using diagnosis codes (Table 5 ) .\", \"First, we evaluated associations between risk factors and blood groups using logistic regressions of risk factors on blood groups. Second, we verified that risk factors are collectively predictive of COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the fit of a logistic regression model using risk factors to a null model, using only an intercept term. Third, we tested whether blood groups provide additional information on outcomes beyond risk factors by comparing the deviances of a full model (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to a nested model using only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors). Fourth, we tested whether the effects of blood groups are modulated by risk factors by comparing logistic regression coefficients for blood groups between nested (outcome ~ blood group) and full (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) logistic regression models. In this comparison, the magnitude of blood group coefficients going to zero when risk factors are added would be evidence that outcome is conditionally independent of blood group given risk factors.\", \"We performed a meta-analysis using our data in combination with data from Wuhan and Shenzhen reported by Zhao et al. [ 3 ] . These analyses used a random effects model to create pooled estimates of odds ratios for each ABO blood group in comparisons between COV+ individuals and the general populations of New York, Wuhan, and Shenzhen. The distribution of blood groups in the general population was estimated using blood group lab results on 108,860 individuals recorded in the NYP/CUIMC electronic health record (EHR) system between May 2011 and June 2019, excluding results for any individuals later tested for COVID-19 (regardless of result). We then compared the general population blood group distributions between New York and Wuhan and Shenzhen and evaluated the heterogeneity between sites.\", \"We considered EHR data up to April 5, 2020. We conducted our analyses using the R language, using the meta package [ 11 ] for meta-analysis.

The manuscript was written openly on GitHub using Manubot [ 12 ] .\", \"We first determined blood groups for SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals using laboratory measurements recorded in the NYP/CUIMC EHR system. One individual with multiple contradictory blood group measurements was excluded, resulting in 1,559 individuals with known blood groups who received a SARS-CoV-2 test (either positive or negative result). Of these, 682 were COV+ (positive in at least one SARS-CoV-2 test) and 877 were COV-(negative in all SARS-CoV-2 tests administered). Among the COV+ individuals, 179 were intubated and 80 had died, while the remaining individuals had not been intubated and were alive as of April 5, 2020. We found that 354 tested COV-individuals were intubated during the same time, though we did not include them in any analysis. Table 1 gives a summary of the cohort we considered. * AB-negative was not included in the ABO+Rh analyses as no individuals with that blood type recorded tested positive for COVID-19.\", \"For each comparison cohort pair, we performed chi-squared tests using both ABO and ABO+Rh blood types (Table 6 ).

Blood groups A were associated with increased odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 1.338, 95% CI [1.072-1.672], p=0.009), while O blood groups were associated with decreased odds of testing positive (OR 0.804, 95% CI [0.654-0.987], p=0.036). While few individuals with AB blood groups were included (21 COV+, 47 COV-), we also found AB blood groups to be associated with decreased odds of testing positive (OR 0.561, 95% CI [0.315-0.969], p=0.033). When we tested individual ABO+Rh blood groups against all others, we discovered that strong associations are only found in Rh positive blood groups (Tables 2 , 7 ). We did not find any significant associations between blood group and intubation or death. Finally, we compared the blood group distributions between all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the general population at NYP/CUIMC, finding insufficient evidence to conclude that tested individuals are not drawn from the general population at random (p=0.2736). \", \"We find that the significant associations we report cannot be explained by known risk factors.

Using blood group ~ risk factors logistic regressions for each blood group, we found significant associations between hypertension and O-blood groups, between age and A, A+, AB, AB+, O, and O+ blood groups, between diabetes mellitus and B and A-blood groups, as well as between overweight status and O+ blood groups (Table 8 ) .\", \"We found that blood groups provide significant additional information on outcomes beyond risk factors. First, we verified that the risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors) provide predictive power compared to intercept-only null models (Table 9 ). Then, we evaluated blood group's effect on COVID-19 outcomes beyond risk factors using analysis of deviance. Specifically, we compared models including both risk factors and blood group (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to those including only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors), and we found that only the COVID-19 test result outcome (COV+ vs COV-) is significantly better explained by including blood group in addition to risk factors (p<0.02 for both ABO and ABO+Rh, Table 9 ). This result is consistent with our univariate analysis (Table 6 ) , where only COV+ vs COV-cohorts showed significant differences in blood group distribution.\", \"Finally, we showed that blood group's effects are not modulated by risk factors. To do so, we inspected individual blood group coefficients between nested (outcome ~ blood group) and full (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) logistic regression models. For ABO blood groups, we found no large coefficient changes, with some coefficients even being more extreme (greater in magnitude and more significant) in full models than in nested models (Table 10 ) . No ABO+Rh blood groups were significant in either the nested or full models for ABO+Rh, though we found no large coefficient changes for these blood groups either. We find little evidence for conditional independence between outcomes and blood groups given risk factors.\", \"Finally, we compared our data from New York City to the data from Wuhan and Shenzhen presented by Zhao et al.\", \"[ 3 ] and conducted a meta-analysis. Zhao et al. used a random effects model to weight and pool effects between three different hospitals (Wuhan Jinyintan, Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital), comparing each hospital's COV+ blood group distribution to the general population distribution for each city. We performed a similar analysis-including NYP/CUIMC data-to assess the effect of blood type in the combined data from all four sources (full counts in Table 3 ).\", \"We fit a random effects model for each ABO blood type using data from NYP/CUIMC and the three sources for which Zhao et al. report data.

Using the additional data from NYP/CUIMC, the pooled association between blood group B becomes larger in effect size and significant at the 5% level (original: OR 1.09, p=0.121; with NYP/CUIMC data: OR 1.25, p=0.0361). \", \"Finally, we found significant heterogeneity among the sites we considered in the meta-analysis. We found that the distribution of blood groups in the general population at NYP/CUIMC differs significantly from both the distributions in Shenzhen (Chi-squared = 2056, p-value < 2.2e-16) and Wuhan (Chi-squared = 583.29, p-value < 2.2e-16) ( Table 3 ) . The difference in distributions is reflected in tests of heterogeneity between sites, where we find more heterogeneity between sites in our meta-analysis than Zhao et al.'s meta-analysis (Table 12 ).\", \"We found consistent negative associations between O blood groups and COVID-19. These results are consistent with an association discovered for SARS-CoV-1 [ 4 ], in which O blood groups were significantly less common among SARS patients.\", \".

However, further stratifying by Rh resulted in significant associations for A+ and O+ only. Negative Rh blood groups are less common in our data, representing only 9.25% of individuals, so the lack of evidence for association with negative blood types could be due to lower sample sizes. Yet, odds ratios for ABO groups A and O are less extreme than the associated ABO+Rh blood groups (A+, O+), and the corresponding negative blood groups (A-, O-) have (insignificant) odds in the opposite directions as their positive counterparts. Further work is needed to better understand the associations between Rh negative blood groups and COVID-19.\", \"Since both blood groups and risk factors vary across populations, we thought it was important to evaluate the associations we found in a multivariate context as well. Indeed, we found significant associations between risk factors and blood groups. However, the significant associations between blood group and COVID-19 status were reflected in significant reductions in deviance when adding blood group to a regression of risk factors on COVID-19 status. Moreover, the blood group regression coefficients were largely unchanged when risk factors were present or not, indicating that blood groups have an independent effect on COVID-19 status not captured by the risk factors. These results suggest that the significant associations we discovered are not explained by confounding due to these risk factors.\", \"Our meta-analysis found large heterogeneity in blood group distributions between Wuhan, Shenzhen, and New York City, consistent with previous work indicating large differences in blood group distributions between the United States and China [ 13 , 14 ] . Overall blood group differences introduced heterogeneity in our meta-analysis comparisons of blood group between COV+ individuals and the general population. However, the increased sample size afforded by adding NYP/CUIMC data allowed the B blood group association to be declared significant at the 5% level. Larger sample sizes of COVID-19 patients will allow afford a more detailed picture of the effects of blood type on COVID-19 susceptibility.\", \"The significant associations we found for blood type between COV+ and COV-individuals were far from significant in a comparison between COV+ and the general population at NYP/CUIMC. A possible explanation for this finding is that individuals tested for infection at NYP/CUIMC represent a more homogeneous sub-population of patients at NYP/CUIMC. Increased homogeneity would strengthen the blood-group-COVID-19 association signal as it would reduce the influence of overall population differences in blood-type distribution. We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals have a significantly different blood group distribution than the general population at NYP/CUIMC, though we cannot rule out other differences between tested and general populations that could explain the difference in associations. Moreover, our meta-analysis using COV+ vs general population found significant associations between A, B, and O blood groups, and the NYP/CUIMC data received 20-30 percent weight for each comparison, indicating a large contribution to the pooled associations. Further work is needed to understand how the population of COVID-tested patients differs from the general population.\", \"We did not identify any significant relationships between blood group and intubation or death due to COVID-19.

Our data is preliminary and represents a snapshot of the pandemic in a New York hospital system. When more patients become tested, intubated, and recovered, we will be better able to assess the relationship between blood group and eventual COVID-19 outcomes that may not have occurred at the time of our analysis.\", \"Our study analyzed EHR data collected during the care of patients, not necessarily with research intent. Our sample sizes were relatively small, making explicit stratifications by age, sex, comorbidities, and other risk factors challenging. As an observational study without rigorous corrections for additional possible confounding, our results should be considered preliminary and should not be taken to inform clinical practice or policy.\", \"In this study we found evidence for association between blood groups and COVID-19. Using data from NYP/CUIMC, we found the odds of COVID-19 positive vs negative test results were increased in blood groups A and decreased in blood groups O, consistent with previous results from Wuhan and Shenzhen. While Rh negative blood types are rare, we find evidence of association only for Rh positive blood groups. Though few AB individuals were included in our cohort, we discovered a new significant odds decrease for AB blood groups. In a meta-analysis of our data with data from Wuhan and Shenzhen reported by Zhao et al., we found a new significant COVID-19 odds increase for B blood groups compared to the general population. We demonstrated that the associations we found were not explained by confounding due to several known risk factors. Our results replicate previously-discovered associations between A and O blood groups and COVID-19, and we show novel associations between B, AB, and Rh blood groups. .

Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and this pneumonia was named as Coronavirus Disease2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO).2 Nowadays, there were more than one million confirmed cases and over 100000 deaths occurred in 208 countries/territories according to the report of WHO until April 12th, 2020. The rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. Lai et al.3 found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. However, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients. Clinical workers should pay attention to the risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death, identify critical patients early, allocate medical resources rationally and timely adjust the treatment plan to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death. In this article, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with critical/mortal illness and non-critical illness in 13 literatures with 3027 patients, to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 patients to develop critical disease or death, in order to effectively predict the progression of the disease, make early treatment response and allocate medical resources in a better way.\", \"This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)Statement.\", \"We selected relevant studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 20, 2020, by searching Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI. We applied no language restrictions. The search terms and relative variants were as follows: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR Wuhan coronavirus OR Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus OR COVID-19 OR COVID19 OR coronavirus disease 2019 virus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS2 OR 2019-nCoV OR 2019 novel coronavirus AND Mortalities OR Mortality OR Fatality OR Death OR acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) OR ICU. We also reviewed the references of included articles to guarantee the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our research.\", \"The inclusion criterions for the 13 articles are as follows: (1) groups involving critical illness or death and non-critical illness;(2) patients should be confirmed to have been infected by 2019 novel coronavirus; (3) study designs included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, case‐control studies, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies, and also case reports;(3) at least one outcome reported among demographical characteristics, comorbidities and clinical manifestations; (4) study sample was larger than 20. We excluded duplicate reports, abstracts from conferences and commentary articles.\", \"Data extraction and the evaluation of literature quality were conducted independently by 2 investigators (Z.Z.H&T.W.L). Microsoft Excel database was used to record all available information, including baseline details, comorbidities, clinical manifestations. Any disagreement was resolved by another investigator (P.F). The MINORS4 was used to assess bias risk.\", \"All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel, State software version 15.0 and RevMan software version 5.3. The results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models (Mantel–Haenszel method) or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between studies. We used the I2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity: 25%, 50%, and 75% represented low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. The chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results: the fixed effect model was used if I2 ≤ 50% and the random effect model was used if I2>50%. If there was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.\", \"Based on the previous search strategy, 523 studies were searched from the online database. After deleting duplicate records, a total of 343 records were retained. Then, 311 articles were excluded by the titles and abstracts, and 19 of the remaining 32 articles were deleted for various reasons. The last 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Finally, a total of 13 studies with 3027 patients were included5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\\n(\\nFigure 1\\n).All of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 27 to 1099 patients.

Over all, none of the studies was considered to be seriously flawed according to the MINORS assessment. The 13 included studies scored between 18 and 21. All studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for selection.\", \"The demographical characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 2\\n. The results from the 13 included studies (with a total amount of 3027 patients) showed that the proportion of male was significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group [male: OR = 1.77, 95% CI (1.43, 2.19), P < 0.00001] (Figure 2\\n).\", \"The median ages ranged from 49 to 70.5 years old in the critical/mortal group across the enrolled studies. The median ages ranged from 37 to 62 years old in the non-critical group (Table1). The median ages were generally higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group. Furthermore, age over 65 years was analyzed as a subgroup by Guan8 and Tian11 (with a total amount of 1273 patients). Meta-analysis showed that the proportion of patients older than 65 years was higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group.

We then compared the difference of the prevalence of the comorbidities between critical/mortal patients and non-critical patients. For diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as I2 = 45%, 37% and 50%. Thus, the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses. The proportion of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [diabetes:0R = 3.68, 95% CI (2.68, 5.03), P < 0.00001;cardiovascular disease: OR = 5.19, 95% CI (3.25, 8.29), P < 0.00001; respiratory disease: OR = 5.15, 95% CI (2.51, 10.57), P < 0.00001](Figure 3\\n). For hypertension, the heterogeneity test showed that I2 = 72%. Given that the severity of illness and severity of epidemic might contribute to the heterogeneity, we classified the studies into two subgroups according to whether the study site was located in Wuhan. However, heterogeneity still exists. So the random effect model was used. The result indicated a higher proportion of hypertension in critical/mortal group[OR = 2.72, 95% CI (1.60,4.64), P = 0.0002] (Figure 3).For malignancy, the fixed-effect model(I2 = 0) meta-analysis showed that the proportion of malignancy was higher in critical/death group yet without statistical significance[OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.81, 3.18), P = 0.18] (Figure 3).\", \"The study of clinical manifestation included 13 studies, a total of 3025 cases. The clinical features are showed in Table 4\\nand the results of meta-analysis are showed in Table 5\\n. For fever (temperature ≥ 37.3°C), the proportion of fever was statistically lower in critical/mortal group [0R = 0.56, 95% CI (0.38, 0.82), P = 0.003]. The proportion of headache and myalgia/arthralgia were lower in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [headache: OR = 0.82, 95% CI (0.50, 1.36), P = 0.45; myalgia/arthralgia: OR = 0.77, 95% CI (0.58, 1.04), P = 0.09] but there was no statistical significance. For cough, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea and nausea/ vomiting, the proportion of them was higher in critical/mortal patients[cough: OR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.85,1.38), P = 0.52; sputum production: OR = 1.14, 95% CI (0.84, 1.54), P = 0.39; fatigue: OR = 1.13, 95% CI (0.88, 1.44), P = 0.34;diarrhea: OR = 1.41, 95% CI (0.82, 2.43), P = 0.22;nausea/ vomiting: OR = 1.32, 95% CI (0.72, 2.42), P = 0.37], however, without statistical significance. For shortness of breath/ dyspnea, the proportion of this clinical manifestation was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group[0R = 4.16, 95% CI (3.13, 5.53), P < 0.00001].\", \"The laboratory examination of the included studies (4 studies, a total of 1286 cases) are shown in Table 6\\n.

For “AST > 40U/L”, “Cr ≥ 133μmol/L” and “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL”, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as I2 = 0%, 0% and 34%. We used the fixed-effect model for further analyses. The proportion of “AST > 40U/L”, “Cr ≥ 133μmol/L” and “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL” was statistically significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group [“AST > 40U/L”:0R = 4.00, 95% CI (2.46, 6.52), P < 0.00001;“Cr ≥ 133μmol/L”:0R = 5.30, 95% CI (2.19, 12.83), P = 0.0002; “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL”:0R = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001] (Figure 5).The I2 value of “PCT > 0.5 ng/mL”, “LDH > 245U/L” and “D-dimer > 0.5mg/L” was, respectively, 52%, 59% and 72%.

We found that patients with shortness of breath/dyspnea were more likely to develop into critical illness or even die, but patients with fever progressed better than those without fever. Laboratory examinations such as WBC, AST, Cr, hs-cTnI, PCT, LDH and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19.\", \"Coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus.18 At present, six human coronaviruses have been identified. And the SARS-CoV-2, which isolated from the lower respiratory tract of pneumonia patients with unknown causes in Wuhan, is identified as the seventh human coronaviruses.19 SARS-CoV-2 attacks the alveolar epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the ACE of isozyme, mainly distributed in cardiovascular, kidneys, testes, lung and colon, and other organizations.20 The main role of ACE2 is to incise Ang II to generate Ang 1-7, which mediates the protective effects of vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation, to antagonize Ang II-induced vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, fibrosis promotion and vascular inflammation.21, 22, 23 When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells, The expression of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells is down-regulated by mechanisms such as internalization, shedding and viral replication.24 Then the increased concentration of Ang II leads to inflammatory response, and exudation of neutrophils, macrophages and fibrinous, resulting in loss of pulmonary ventilation function and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation.25 At the same time, viral infection will cause the imbalance of T helper-1 and T helper-2 responses, and induce an inflammatory storm by increasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6.26 Inflammatory storm in critical patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune injury, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death.27\\n\", \"Studies have found that women are less susceptible to viral infection than men, possibly because of the protection of X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity.28 At the same time, men tend to be associated with bad lifestyle habits such as smoking and underlying diseases. As a result, the majority of critical or mortal patients are male. As the body's immunity declines with age, elderly patients are more likely to develop critical illness or even die. Therefore, when the patient is male, over 65 years old and smoking, the patient has a higher risk of developing critical illness or death.\", \"When patients are combined with basic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, the body is in a state of stress for a long time and the immunity tends to be low. Moreover, the long-term history of diabetes and hypertension will damage the vascular structure, and it is more likely to develop into critical disease in infection. Patients with chronic heart disease are more likely to be infected due to their weakened heart function and low immunity. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are more likely to have acute cardiovascular events and develop into severe diseases. When the patient has previous respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient's lung function is damaged. They have lower resistance to the virus and are prone to developing ARDS. Thus, underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease are risk factors for disease progression. This is consistent with the analytical results in this paper.\", \"The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough and sputum.6 When the patient's immune response is low, it may manifest as normal body temperature. Shortness of breath or dyspnea suggests poor lung function and lacking of oxygen. Therefore, when the patient is found to have difficulty in breathing or no fever, it is necessary to be alert for further deterioration of the patient's condition.\", \"Viral infection will cause inflammation in human body. Various inflammatory factors produced by the inflammatory storm can cause systemic immune damage and even cause multi-organ failure. When the patient's laboratory indicator shows PCT > 0.5 ng/mL, there is a higher risk of progression to critical illness. Study showed that the total number of WBC in the early stage of the disease is normal or reduced.6 However, WBC < 4 × 109/L means a better clinical outcome in this paper. Therefore, when the total number of WBC is found to be higher than the previous one, the patient may be associated with other infections that aggravated the disease. At this moment, the clinicians might pay more attentions to these patients and improve treatment. When AST > 40U/L, LDH > 245U/L and Cr ≥ 133 mol/L, it indicates that the liver and kidney dysfunctions have been involved, and corresponding treatments should be taken in time to prevent further deterioration of the disease. Current studies have shown that up to 20% of covid-19 patients have abnormal coagulation function.6 Monocytes and tissue cells are activated after injury, causing the release of cytokines and the expression of tissue factors, and finally causing the hypercoagulability of blood. It will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera, which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death. When the D-dimer > 0.5mg/L, it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct and/or indirect action. The direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ACE2 receptor, while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response and/or oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome. When hs-cTnI > 28pg/mL, it strongly suggests the possibility of further deterioration of the patient's condition.\", \"The quality of the literature included in this study is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible. However, this meta‐analysis also has some limitations: (a) most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional studies with insufficient demonstration ability. (b) most of the patients in our meta-analysis were Chinese, and our aim was to use the findings of this study to predict the overall profile of patients, including other countries and races; (c) more detailed patient information, such as iconograph and oxygen at ion index, was not available in most studies at the time of analysis. The conclusions of this meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.\", \"This study analyzed the risk factors for progression to critical illness or death in COVID-19 patients to help assessing patient status and identify critical patients early. Pay close attention to these risk factors, and when relevant laboratory risk value appears, timely and personalized treatment regimens are needed to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death.\"],\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"sciwingI2B2\": {\n        \"0,4\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,6\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,17\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,23\": \"test\",\n        \"0,28\":

Cases per 100,000 people and deaths per 100,000 people for each U.S. county were calculated using CSSE and census data. Counties were excluded from the analyses if they had fewer than 50 cases or their first case occurred fewer than 3 weeks prior to the end of the study. With these constraints, 661 counties from 50 states and Washington D.C were included in case analysis.

Logistic regression was used to compare counties in the highest quartile for cases per 100,000 to those in the lowest. There were an insufficient number of counties meeting the deaths per 100,000 requirements to run logistic regression, thus linear regression was used for deaths per 100,000 analyses. Results of linear regression for cases per 100,000 including all 661 counties are provided for direct comparison between cases and deaths.\", \"The sequential model had four parts. Each model included all variables from the previous models. Model 1 was a univariate analysis. Model 2 added the following county macroeconomic and COVID-19-specific variables: population density, GDP/capita, COVID-19 tests per 100,000 people (state level data), COVID-19 cases/100,000 people (deaths analysis only), a marker for which State the county is in, average percent reduction in cellphone movement from day of first confirmed case to end of study, the percent of population living in overcrowded housing, and the number of days since the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Model 3 added these county demographics and environmental variables to Model 2: percent of population over 65, proportion of Black residents, percent of the population that is female, percent of population living in rural areas, the Food Environment Index (a measure of accessibility and affordability of healthy food), the rate of violent crime per 100,000 people, the average temperature from 10 days before the first case to the end of the study, air quality measured as the average annual ambient concentrations of PM2.5, percent of the population considered to be in fair or poor health, and the poverty rate. Model 4 was the full model and included medical comorbidities and access to health care variables in addition to all variables in Model 3. Specifically these new variables were: diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, excessive drinking, and smoking were all reported as percent of the population; liver disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease were reported as mortality per 100,000 people; and the patient to primary care physician ratio, the percent of people sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, the percent of the population without health insurance and the percent of the population who received the flu vaccine were also included All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Recent work has primarily focused on patient demographics, underlying health comorbidities, social disparities in healthcare access and quality, and environmental variables such as pollution to identify potential risk factors and vulnerable populations. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] However, while these previous studies have examined the effects of these domains on COVID-19 spread independently, some do not control for the potentially confounding interactions between variables. In this study, we sought to investigate COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in all U.S. counties through a more comprehensive framework that accounts for effects of county-level macroeconomic, demographic, environmental, health status, and healthcare access variables. By conducting sequential multivariate analyses of variables that span social, structural, and environmental spheres, our study aims to more completely characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby identify particularly salient risk factors and vulnerable populations in the United States.\", \"In recent weeks, numerous headlines and research studies have brought race to the forefront as a potentially significant risk factor for increased COVID- 19 .

[18] [19] [20] Studies have also cited the many inequities in structural variables, which now manifest in the disproportionate number of Black Americans who suffer from poverty, reside in densely packed areas with more environmental hazards, have decreased access to healthy food sources, and lack healthcare coverage and access. 31 In our comprehensive multivariate analysis, we were able to control for these potentially confounding variables; however, after doing so, our data continue to demonstrate a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in counties with large Black populations in the United States.\", \"This increased disease burden did not seem to be explained by previously proposed mechanisms, indicating that other modulating factors should be considered and novel interventions designed appropriately. One potential domain includes additional sociocultural variables that have only now become relevant within the context of the pandemic. For example, African Americans make up a large percentage of the healthcare, transportation, government, and food supply industries, job sectors that have now been deemed \\\"essential\\\" services in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 34 Despite the majority of Americans currently living in counties with some form of social distancing mandate, a recent announcement by the U.S. Surgeon General indicated that fewer than one in five Black Americans have a job that gives them this flexibility to work from home, compared with more than a third of white and Asian American workers. 35 The potentially fatal consequences of this fact can already be seen in the case of the New York City transit system. The city's transit workforce, which has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 2,000 cases, 59 deaths, and over 4,000 employees in quarantine, is comprised mostly of ethnic and racial minorities, with African Americans accounting for nearly half of transit workers despite making up just 24% of the city's overall population. 36, 37 Furthermore, despite an 87% reduction in overall ridership since the pandemic began, the nearly one million remaining passengers-most of whom lack the luxury of social distancing due to essential employment-are predominantly low-income people of color. 38 However, this theory is complicated by the fact that Hispanic workers also makeup a disproportionate percentage of the essential workforce, yet our data do not suggest an increased burden of COVID-19 cases and mortality amongst counties with greater Hispanic populations. 35 A potential explanation may be that Black workers may be more likely than other racial and ethnic minority groups to work essential jobs that also require close proximity and frequent contact with others, such as bus drivers, postal workers, and grocery store clerks, which would convey additional risk of COVID-19 infection. 39, 40 However, more work is needed to elucidate potential mechanisms to explain the differing disease burdens between these vulnerable populations.\", \"One potential consideration is that non-Hispanic Black populations in the United States have been shown to suffer from vitamin D deficiency at rates much higher than any other ethnic or racial group, with recent data suggesting that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations in the United States suffer from vitamin D deficiency at rates of 24 and 4 times more than those .

Several recent reports have also linked higher temperature to decreased virus spread, while others have found no significant effects. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Here, we demonstrate an independent effect of temperature that results in reduced COVID-19 cases, but not mortality, across U.S. counties. If warmer temperatures do, in fact, play a role in mitigating disease spread, it is reasonable to expect a potential seasonal trend in global cases and mortality. As temperatures begin to warm in the Northern hemisphere during the summer months, we may begin to see a decrease in disease burden; however, we should prepare to see a resurgence in COVID-19 incidence when temperatures again decrease in the fall and winter months, as has been exhibited in previous pandemics like the Spanish flu. 46 Likewise, countries in the Southern hemisphere should be prepared to experience seasonal trends in the opposite direction.\", \"The mechanism through which temperature may execute its mitigative effects remains unclear, though it has already been posited that increased vitamin D levels due to greater sun exposure may result in better immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it has been shown to do within the context of other viruses. 42, 43 Notably, when temperature is substituted out of our final model for other vitamin D proxies, such as average daily sunlight and latitude above and below 37 degrees, the results are also highly significant in the same direction. Including these variables together in the model resulted in multicollinearity, which suggests that they are most likely measuring the same effect. Thus, in this study, average temperature prior to the first reported COVID-19 case was chosen to be the vitamin D proxy because it was the continuous variable that contained the most specific and validated data at the county level.\", \"One potential clinical implication of these findings is on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine therapy in treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has shown some promise in early research. 47 Chloroquine has been shown to reduce the conversion of vitamin D from calcidiol to calcitriol, the former of which has been demonstrated to potentiate the immune system, 48 which may serve as a partial mechanism for the purported beneficial effects of chloroquine therapy on COVID-19 outcomes. Future research, both clinical and epidemiological, should focus on serum vitamin D levels directly to see if they demonstrate any significant effects on COVID-19 spread and morbidity. Such studies on the role of serum vitamin D levels on COVID-19 outcomes are already underway, including a retrospective review of patients with documented vitamin D levels at our institution as well as a prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted by the University of Grenada that is investigating the role of vitamin D supplementation therapy versus placebo on outcomes in 200 COVID-19 patients. 49 Our results support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation, whether through behavioral or dietary interventions, may prove to be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in the United States. Though the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation seem to be particularly relevant for racial and ethnic minorities, they should also be considered for the entire population, as studies have found that less than 30% of U.S. adults have vitamin D levels that are considered sufficient for optimal health outcomes. 41 Though standardized data on worldwide vitamin D levels are currently lacking, existing meta-analyses suggest that vitamin D deficiency is also a rampant issue on a global scale and should be prioritized for future research in light of the current pandemic. 50 If the theorized effects of vitamin D on COVID-19 morbidity are supported by ongoing studies, vitamin D deficiency could emerge as a unifying theory for the findings herein and allow countries to mobilize resources in anticipation of seasonal trends and develop targeted interventions to mitigate risk.\", \"Other findings associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths included increased poverty, increased GDP per capita, increased pollution, and increased flu vaccination rate . Poverty and GDP are not typically thought to be positively correlated with each other, however, the correlations seen here may represent inequalities in health care versus and access to testing.For example, poverty may exacerbate case spread, while economic power increases testing rates, both of which would lead to increased cases. 47 Flu vaccination was included as a marker for access to healthcare and may be associated with greater testing rates. Additionally, flu vaccination is often mandated for healthcare workers, thus counties with higher flu vaccination rates may have more of its citizens having front line exposure to the virus. 52, 53 Decreased pollution was associated with increased COVID-19 cases, which does not align with prior findings in studies that associated increased air pollution with increased mortality. 15, 29 Our model also shows an inconclusive connection between air quality and COVID-19 deaths. However, air pollution data in this study is from 2014 and may not reflect current air pollution. Given increased social distancing, many counties with historically bad air pollution currently .

The most likely reason for this is due to the simultaneity bias of this metric. In particular, the metric used here does not differentiate between proactive counties and reactive counties. It is expected that less proactive social distancing will cause more cases and deaths (negative correlation) while higher numbers of cases and deaths induces fear, causing increased reactive social distancing (positive correlation). Since these effects work in opposite directions, this bias makes it more difficult to find an effect of social distancing. Studies that plan to model social distancing with numerous covariates should ensure their metric adequately delineates between proactive and reactive social distancing or employ an appropriate instrument to remove this simultaneity. 56 \", \"The emerging nature of Covid-19 required inclusion of only counties with sufficient data. Many counties were excluded from analysis for lack of Covid-19 cases or lack of Covid-19 deaths. This limitation is unavoidable and waiting for sufficient data may deter public health response. This study is also limited by the fact the COVID-19 pandemic is still in progress in all of the counties included here and is at different stages. Thus, the number of cases and mortality statistics for the counties provides a snapshot of the current state, but may not, and likely will not, be reflective of the ultimate case and death tolls in these counties. Moreover, most counties are still in the early stages of accumulating deaths which axiomatically lags behind the number of cases. While our results of temperature and Black race on cases per 100,000 have been consistent for a number of weeks, the number of counties with at least 10 deaths has only recently become large enough to perform similar analyses. Temperature also demonstrates this lack of simultaneity, but changes more predictably and slowly than Covid-19 cases and deaths. Additionally, since we relied heavily on publicly available and easily accessible sources to create our database, we used sources that may be outdated or otherwise inconsistent with the actual value of various statistics during the past few months. Confounding effects are also possible, given that it is impossible to fully extricate socioeconomic, demographic, and even some environmental variables from each other. The stepwise approach to regression mitigates excessive confounding risk through sensitivity analysis and signifies that the findings are not error artifacts. Ecological fallacies may be present in the model for demographic and socioeconomic variables compared to individual cases and deaths; we report as granularly as practical to account for this.\", \".

This study evaluated the independent effects of Black race and temperature on the incidence of cases and mortality of COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. In multivariate regression analyses that controlled for county demographics, socioeconomic factors, and medical comorbidities, counties with higher average daily temperatures were associated with decreased COVID-19 cases, but not deaths. Black race was significantly associated with both increased cases and increased deaths. This suggests that many of the proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19 such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity. A potential unifying theory of these results is the preponderance of vitamin D deficiency of Black citizens in comparison to other races in the U.S. However, additional study is needed to further understand these results. .

by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the outbreak which initially occurred in Wuhan, China in late 2019, is now rapidly spreading globally [1] .\", \"The world is expected to implement early precautionary measures to control the spread of COVID-19 through restriction of activities.\", \"Epilepsy, a disease characterized by a spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions. Its prevalence rate is reported to be 0.7-1.0 % with high incidences in elderly people and children [2] ; additionally, some patients have comorbidities.\", \"Associations between epilepsy and COVID- 19 have not been reported. Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID- 19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferring from past experiences of infectious diseases.\", \"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that neurological comorbidities, including epilepsy, may be a risk factor for COVID-19, despite the lack of evidence. Presently, a medical history of epilepsy has not been reported to be a risk factor for developing COVID-19. Moreover, past experiences with infectious diseases do not suggest any associations. Considering the experience with previous infectious diseases, some societies suggest that epilepsy itself seems unlikely to represent a risk J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f factor for COVID-19. (Table 1 ) However, certain pre-existing conditions (such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer) are recognized as risk factors [3, 4] . Therefore, epilepsy patients with these comorbidities may adopt a more cautionary approach regarding COVID-19. Conversely, children infected with COVID-19, including those just with well-controlled epilepsy and no other health conditions, are generally asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms [5] .\", \"COVID-19 prevention strategies recommended by the CDC are applicable to all individuals, including those with epilepsy.\", \"Baig et al. suggested that the central nervous system could be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 as the angiotensin-converting enzyme two receptors have been detected on the surface of glial cells and neurons [6, 7] .\", \"However, the effects of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients and the prevalence of newonset epilepsy cases remain unclear. Reported symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily associated with respiratory or gastrointestinal issues and have not been commonly related to seizures [8] . According to previous data, the rate of neurological comorbidity has not been assumed to be greater for COVID-19 than other respiratory viral infectious diseases. Conversely, epilepsy patients infected with COVID-19 or any other infectious diseases may have fever, which may possibly trigger seizures.\", \"Additionally, the association between anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and medications for COVID-19 requires consideration. Currently, no specific medications have been Certain epilepsy medications may affect the immune system, including everolimus and steroids that are used for tuberous sclerosis complex and autoimmune epilepsy, respectively. However, according to some studies, everolimus may prevent viral infections [9] . Meanwhile, the usage of corticosteroids is correlated with the risk of infectious diseases [10] . Hence, medications need to be chosen on an individual basis in clinical settings. Furthermore, some societies do not recommend changing the AEDs of patients with well-controlled seizures, as seizure exacerbations or status epilepticus may increase the risk of COVID-19 infections. It is also important in clinical settings to inform patients that they should not discontinue AEDs without the advice of a physician, even if it would affect to immune systems.\", \"Some societies suggest that COVID-19 could increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are some reports which indicate that infection or viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infectious disease might increase the risk of SUDEP [11, 12] . However, there are still no data on the association between COVID-19 and SUDEP.\", \"Many societies recommend that patients should avoid running out of AEDs. The state of increased or uncontrollable seizures could cause some problems. One is the effect of seizure on the patient's body condition. Mortality associated with epilepsy is higher in patients with uncontrollable seizures than in those with controllable seizures [13, 14] .\", \"Frequent seizures would cause malnutrition and the state of nutrition is associated with the immune system [15] . The second problem is that going to emergency rooms due to increased or uncontrollable seizures could expose the patient to coronavirus. Epilepsy foundation does not recommend going to emergency room unless there is an actual emergency. Finally, uncontrollable seizures, especially status epilepticus, would need sedation and ventilators. However, in clinical settings at regions with many COVID-19 patients, clinicians face the shortage of mechanical ventilators [16] . Increase in the number of patients with status epilepticus would aggravate this problem. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the control of seizures, as well as the prevention of COVID-19. However, visits to doctors and periodic filling of prescriptions account for the greater difficulty encountered by epilepsy patients in avoiding crowded situations. Previous experience with SARS evidently shows that emerging infectious diseases can potentially prevent epilepsy patients from keeping up with their routine appointments [17] . This can be mitigated through the introduction of telemedicine and purchase of prescription medications lasting a minimum of a few J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f months. Telemedicine allows consultations with doctors without exposure to crowded conditions, and thus prevents the spread of COVID-19 among patients. Hence, introduction and implementation of telemedicine should be given further consideration.\", \"Intractable epilepsy may be assessed and diagnosed by video-monitoring encephalograms and hospitalization. Elective surgical treatments for epilepsy, along with other non-urgent surgical procedures, may be postponed to prevent further spread of COVID-19 among medical staff and patients [18] . Hospitals should rather prepare for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require critical care.\", \"Epilepsy patients who require urgent interventions, along with their families and medical staff, should adhere to thorough prevention and protection protocols against COVID-19.\", \"Some patients do not have emergency but progressive conditions of epilepsy. As for these cases, the real risk of proceeding and the real risk of delay on intervention should be considered case by case.\", \"Epilepsy patients may be dependent on caregivers. Epilepsy patients suspected to be infected with COVID-19 should be isolated; the caregiver should seek treatment, especially through oral care or aspirations, for prevention and protection against J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19. Protection against COVID-19 also necessitates the treatment of COVID-19 carriers.\", \"Caregivers infected or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 should stop providing care to their patients and isolate themselves. They may also find replacements for their clients for the time being.\", \"As for epilepsy patients who live alone, it is suggested to keep regular contact with someone to inform that they are alright while self-isolating, especially patients with uncontrolled seizures.\", \"It is important to provide this information to epilepsy patients and their families so that they may be prevented from being infected with COVID-19. Additionally, the spread of correct information will reduce unnecessary anxiety and stress. According to Hu M. et al., educating epilepsy patients would reduce seizure frequency and accidental injuries caused by seizures [19] . Conversely, internet and social media can be a source of informal, uncertain, or misleading information that may cause people to respond erroneously or panic unnecessarily. A system for disseminating reliable resources of information needs to be established. A few medical associations and societies have provided useful information regarding epilepsy and COVID-19 ( Table 1 ) that may be shared. Translations and subsequent dissemination of these resources can also aid epilepsy patients globally. Moreover, the American epilepsy society have also provided information and attention points for clinicians.\", \"This article reviewed known facts of COVID-19 associated with epilepsy and the suggestions from medical societies. The effect of COVID-19 on individuals with epilepsy remains unclear. Clinicians need to share case information, continue investigations, and provide known facts to epilepsy patients and their families.\", \"This work did not receive any specific grant from funding

We also consider social and demographic variables that have the potential to interact with or may cause health risks, such as smoking history or the inability to afford medical 15 care. For example, 11% of workers in industries deemed essential by the US government do not have health insurance (~10 million people). A lack of health care coverage or perceived inability to afford care could prevent patients from seeking treatment early, exacerbating risk of severe outcomes (11) . Our results show that 8% of the total workforce, equivalent to 12 million people, delayed medical treatment in the last 12 months due to cost.

The percentage of the workforce with any risk factor across all industries ranges from 71% to 93%. After removing obesity from the risk factor criteria, the proportion of the population categorized as at risk declines (56%), but the spatial dispersion grows, ranging from 37% to 75%. The highest risk is concentrated in the Midwest and the lowest in the Intermountain West and West Coast. As little as 5% of the 5 workforce over age 60 in some counties (e.g. Lander County, NV) has a risk factor, while in others, the percentage over age 60 and at-risk is over 40% (Martin County, IN) . Notable disparities exist within regions, states, and between neighboring counties. For example, Greene County, Ohio's workforce over 60 is twice as at risk than the workforce of bordering counties. This trend is found in clusters of both rural and urban counties, including those centered in 10 Marion, IN; Pulaski, MO; and Geary, KA. Somewhat counter-intuitively, there is no significant difference in the overall proportion of the total workforce at risk between rural and urban counties. However, outlier counties with extremely high or low proportions of at-risk workers are more likely to be rural and less populated. The proportion of the workforce at risk only ranged from 46% to 66% across urban counties, while the range across rural counties was from 15 37% to 75%. This is perhaps due to the small number of total workers and the low diversity of industries in rural counties relative to urban regions, or disparities in income between urban and rural locales.\", \"There is significant heterogeneity in risk between industries at the regional level, and this is even greater when broken down by county. A common trend is that sparsely populated 20 counties are most likely to have entire industries at relatively high or low risk. This is because there are few people in those counties working in any one industry.

In contrast, the healthcare 10 workforce in counties in the south, mid-west, and west is more likely to delay seeking healthcare due to cost (9.3 ± .08) than in the Northeast (5.8% ±1.7).

However, our analysis suggests countries can also mitigate overall risk by planning for and managing the consequences of infection. Developing these strategies necessitates identifying the consequences of infection at the community level. This involves understanding optimal resource allocation within hospitals and factors that influence hospital labor and materials supply (12, 13) . It also means planning 10 policies to respond to the exposure of sections of the broader labor force to COVID-19 complications.\", \"COVID-19 relief planning has focused on urban centers and areas where community transmission likely began earlier due to international travel, and is exacerbated through public transport, and tighter living quarters, such as New York City. Our analysis suggests that although 15 rural counties in the United States might have a relatively lower rates of transmission currently, portions of their populations can have a greater risk of hospitalization and death once infected.\", \"Essential industries in rural counties are made up of smaller, and sometimes more homogenous, workforces. As such, the absence of just a small number of essential workers could lead to the collapse of these industries, leaving entire communities without necessary goods and 20 services. For example, large meat processing plants in Iowa and Pennsylvania were shut down due to workers testing positive for the virus, and workers at a chicken processing plant in Georgia walked out in protest over being exposed to other employees with the virus (14, 15) .\", \"Larger industries in urban counties, on the other hand, are likely more resilient to worker .

As such, the small size of an industry is itself a risk factor. Consideration of this may be critical to the efficacy of policies to implement staged back-to-work policies in the US. Where rural workers are unlikely to be able to return to work, planning for enhanced mobility of replacement workers from urban centers may be beneficial. Similar strategies were adopted in China wherein essential healthcare workers 5 were moved into Hubei to support a dearth caused by increased infection rates and a more severe lockdown (16).\", \"Social distancing measures outside of urban centers in the United States are simplified by more physically spread out communities and a lack of public transport. However, workers in essential industries, such as hospitals, food systems and public services (utilities, public safety), 10 are less likely to be able to work from home (17). Furthermore, workers in rural and urban essential industries where working from home is less frequently an option, are more likely to have social risk factors, such as lack of insurance coverage or inability to afford medical care (11) . This category of workers is also more likely to be in the bottom half of the income distribution, less likely to be white, and less likely to have a college degree (11) . Therefore, it is 15 possible that the workers in the US most vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure are also the workers at the highest risk of hospitalization or death. The interplay of social and health risk factors will be important when considering where to focus relief efforts.\", \"Our analysis demonstrates important heterogeneity in susceptibility to COVID-19 between geographic areas, across industries, and depending on the most pertinent health and 20 social risk factors.

However, we caution that efforts to contain the virus to urban and other hotspots may already have failed (e.g. Blaine County, Iowa), and therefore response efforts should now also consider the risk of disease severity in sectors of the population (2). This 5 requires a shift of focus to high-risk counties and industries. Failure to protect vulnerable workforces could lead to the breakdown of essential industries in these counties and cause avoidable deaths and hardship in their communities.

posed a threat to public health several times. Coronavirus, which usually causes respiratory-tract infections in humans, has been linked to several infectious diseases and subsequent global challenges (1, 2). In December 2019, clusters of patients with viral pneumonia were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus. The infection caused by the novel coronavirus was named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and this coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization and International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (3). As of March 31th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 81 554 infections and 3312 deaths in China (4), which far exceeds those caused by both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV worldwide. An increasing number of studies have suggested that people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. Moreover, human-to-human hospital-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be possible (5, 6).\", \"This study aimed to provide additional data regarding the clinical features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and specifically to analyze the factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement, and mortality.\", \"All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11th to February 6th, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. We obtained oral informed consent from all patients enrolled in the study. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in both the nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.\", \"Our primary outcomes included disease severity at admission, unimprovement and mortality during follow-up. The disease severity and improvement were defined according to the interim guidelines from the World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China (7, 8). According to the patients’ symptoms, laboratory results and imaging findings at admission, the disease severity of COVID-19 patients (also known as patients’ conditions) can be divided into four types, including mild, moderate, severe, and critical conditions. Patients with slight clinical symptoms and without imaging findings of pneumonia are treated as mild condition. When patients have fever or respiratory symptoms, they are identified as moderate condition. If patients have one of the three situations, they are considered as severe condition: respiratory distress and the respiratory rate is higher than 30 times per minute; fingertip blood oxygen saturation is less than 93% at rest; Partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2) ≤300mmHg. When patients contain one of the following three situation, they are identified as critical condition: respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation; shock condition; with other organ failure requires ICU treatment. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines (9). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition (10). Meanwhile, patients exhibiting one of the following situations during follow-up were considered to have improvement: continuously decreased temperature or normal temperature (below 37.3°C), improved respiratory symptoms (disappeared or obviously relieved), gradual reduction of pulmonary inflammation upon imaging analysis (obviously reduced shadow area), negative results of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection. Otherwise, they were considered to show unimprovement.\", \"Three physicians collected and reviewed the data. The epidemiological data, medical history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms and signs both at admission and during follow-up, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, real-time RT-PCR detection results, and survival data were obtained from patients’ electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptoms were noticed. Laboratory values and chest CT scans were collected at admission. Symptoms and signs at admission and during the hospital stay were also both collected. The clinical outcomes were followed up until February 9th, 2020.\", \"Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared using the χ2 test. Fisher’s exact test was also used to estimate continuous variables if one set contained less than 5 expected subjects. When continuous measurements were normally distributed, they were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and an independent group t-test was used. Otherwise, the interquartile range (IQR) values and the Mann-Whitney U test was used. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\", \"A logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with the primary outcomes. All variables associated with the primary outcomes were included in the univariate regression model. Variables with P < 0.05 level in previous analyses were entered into logistic multivariate regression models. Continuous variable was dichotomized. The variables included in the final model were selected by an automatic procedure. We tested in the model interactions that were significant on a stratified analysis Odds ratio (OR) was presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software (version 19.0).\", \"A total of 663 COVID-19 patients confirmed via PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. The median age was 55.6 years (IQR, 44-69; range, 16-95 years). Among them, 321 (48.4%) were men, with a median age of 57.8 years (IQR, 46-70; range, 23-95 years), and 342 (51.6%) were women, with a median age of 57.8 years (IQR, 42-67; range, 16-90 years) (Table 1\\n). Most of the patients were either retirees (227, 34.2%) or employees (211, 31.8%). Of the 663 COVID-19 patients, 247 (37.3%) had at least one chronic disease. Cardiovascular diseases (21.1%), endocrine system disease (10.1%), and respiratory system disease (7.9%) were the three most common coexisting chronic diseases among the included patients.\", \"Among the 663 patients, at admission, 0.5% (n = 3) were classified as being mild COVID-19 condition, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were classified as moderate, severe, and critical, respectively (Table 1). The median ages of patients with mild-to-moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 were 49.1 (IQR, 36-61), 61.3 (IQR, 49-70), and 67.0 (IQR, 58.3-76.8) years, respectively, which exerted significantly differences (P < 0.001). Older patients (>60 years old) were more likely to exhibit severe and critical COVID-19 condition than others (≦ 60 years old, P < 0.001). Among the mild, moderate, severe, and critical patients, 100% (3/3), 76.5% (192/251), 60.0% (189/315), and 34.0% (32/94), respectively, had no chronic disease, which indicated that patients with chronic disease are more prone to severe forms of COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the presence of previously diagnosed respiratory (P = 0.003), cardiovascular (P=0.000), endocrine system (P = 0.007), and inflammatory diseases (P = 0.020) was associated with disease severity (Table 1).\", \"Regarding the symptoms, dyspnea (P < 0.001), chest tightness (P < 0.001), diarrhea (P = 0.003), fatigue (P = 0.015), dizziness (P = 0.009), muscle ache (P = 0.028), and unconsciousness (P = 0.020) were significantly linked to severe COVID-19 cases (Table 2\\n). Moreover, increased white blood cell (P < 0.001) and neutrophil counts (P < 0.001), decreased lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001), decreased hemoglobin (P < 0.001), increased ALT (P = 0.015) and/or AST (P < 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.001), increased CRP (P < 0.001), decreased albumin(P < 0.001), and increased LDH (P < 0.001) at admission were significantly associated with severe and critical disease conditions (Table 3\\n).\", \"A total of 251 (37.9%) patients were improved in hospital during follow-up (Table 1). The median age of these patients was 48.1 years (IQR, 34-60; range, 22-85 years) which was younger than patients without improvement (median age, 61.9; IQR, 52-72; range, 16-95 years, P < 0.001). Older patients (>60 years) were more prone to have no improvement than others (≦ 60 years old, P < 0.001). Among the patients with improvement, 103 (41.0%) were men and most of them (130, 51.8%) were employees. Moreover, 198 (251, 78.9%) patients with improvement had no chronic disease (Table 1), which is significantly higher than patients without improvement (219, 53.2%; P < 0.001).\", \"With respect to the systemic symptoms at admission, fever (P = 0.007), dizziness (P = 0.023), and muscle ache (P < 0.001) were found to influence patients’ improvement in hospital (Table 2). The patients who exhibited expectoration, dyspnea, and chest tightness at admission were more likely to respond to therapy and had better overall outcomes (P < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, respectively). However, digestive symptoms had no effect on patients’ improvement.\", \"At admission, increased white blood cell counts were significantly associated with patients who responded to treatment (P = 0.011). Moreover, when patients had neutrophil counts above the normal range, they were more likely to exhibit improved symptom during follow-up (P < 0.001). Patients with improvement were also found to have lymphocyte counts below the normal range (P < 0.001). Additionally, decreased hemoglobin (P = 0.006), increased ALT (P = 0.001) and/or AST (P < 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.001), increased CRP (P < 0.001), decreased albumin (P < 0.001), and increased LDH (P < 0.001) were also shown to be associated with COVID-19 improvement. Furthermore, patients with both unilateral pneumonia as diagnosed by CT scans were more likely to be improved (P < 0.001, Table 3).\", \"In univariate analysis, being male, severe and critical condition, expectoration, muscle ache, decreased albumin, decreased lymphocytes, older than 60, occupation, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, chest tightness, fever, bilateral pneumonia, reduced hemoglobin, increased ALT, increased AST, increased LDH, damaged kidney function and increased CRP were associated with unimprovement in hospital. In multivariate analysis, being male (OR = 0.486, 95% CI 0.311-0.758; P = 0.001), having severe COVID-19 condition (OR = 0.129, 95% CI 0.082-0.201; P < 0.001), expectoration (OR = 1.796, 95% CI 1.062-3.036; P = 0.029), muscle ache (OR = 0.309, 95% CI 0.153-0.626; P = 0.001), and decreased albumin (OR = 1.929, 95% CI 1.199-3.104; P = 0.007) at admission were independent risk factors associated with unimprovement during follow-up. (Table 4\\n).\", \"Additionally, a total of 25 patients included in the study died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77% (Table 1). The median age of the deceased patients was 69.3 years (IQR, 61-78; range, 34-90 years), which is significantly higher than that of the survival patients (median age 56.1; IQR, 43-68; range, 16-95 years; P < 0.001). And older patients (>60 years) were significantly more likely to die in hospital than others (≦ 60 years old, P = 0.004). Eight of the dead patients (32.0%) had no chronic disease (Table 2). When comparing the dead and surviving patient populations, the only two symptoms which exhibited significant differences was dyspnea (P = 0.019) and unconsciousness (P < 0.001).\", \"Compared to other patients, the proportion of patients with increased white blood cell counts (P < 0.001), neutrophil counts above the normal range (P = 0.001), lymphocytes counts below the normal range (P = 0.006), increased ALT (P = 0.011) and/or AST (P = 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.021), increased CRP (P = 0.014), decreased albumin (P = 0.005), and increased LDH (P = 0.046) at admission was higher among the deceased patient population (Table 3).\", \"In our study population, there were 247 patients who had at least one kind of chronic disease. Cardiovascular diseases, endocrine system disease, and respiratory system disease were the three most common coexisting chronic diseases. There were 91 patients who had no fever at admission. Additionally, 22 of the included COVID-19 patients did not exhibit any symptoms and were only found to be positive via the results of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Most patients had systemic, respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue were the three most common symptoms. On admission, most patients had white blood cell and neutrophil counts in the normal range and lymphocyte counts below the normal range. About a quarter of COVID-19 patients had differing degrees of hepatic function abnormality and one in ten patients had kidney function abnormality. Most patients had increased CRP, decreased albumin, and increased LDH. The vast majority of patients also had bilateral pneumonia in CT imaging.\", \"One-third of the patients were improved in hospital during follow-up. Twenty-five patients died and the mortality rate was 3.77%. The mortality rate in our study was lower than that indicated in a previous report but higher than that reported in another study (5, 11). This heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the case inclusion criteria. However, our results were closer to the mortality rate indicated by official national statistics, which is 3.97%. Cumulative studies confirmed that older age was associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In our study, older patients were prone to have severe COVID-19 symptoms, unimprovemrnt, and were more likely to die in hospitals. Based on previous findings in animal studies, older animals were shown to have stronger host innate immune responses to SARS-CoV infection (12). The unsatisfactory control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses in older individuals due to age-dependent defects was found to lead to a marked decline in cell-mediated immune function and reduced humoral immune function, which potentially leads to poor outcomes (13, 14).\", \"Fever, dizziness, muscle ache, expectoration, dyspnea, and chest tightness at admission were also found to influence patients’ improvement in hospital. Dyspnea and unconsciousness were the only two symptoms which were associated with mortality.\", \"A recent study reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid fragments in the stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted via the fecal-oral route (15). In our study, approximately one in six COVID-19 patients had digestive symptoms, especially diarrhea, which is more than was reported in a previous study (11). The digestive symptoms of most COVID-19 patients were mild, which seemed to be inconsistent with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A possible explanation is that SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum of COVID-19 patients is transmitted to the digestive tract through swallowing. There, under the action of various digestive enzymes, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive tract is weakened and the virus is degraded into fragments that only cause mild digestive symptoms but not serious gastrointestinal damage.\", \"In conclusion, being male, as well as having severe COVID-19 symptoms, expectoration, muscle ache, and decreased albumin were shown to be independent risk factors which influence patients’ improvement during follow-up. Older age was associated with poor conditions and outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\", \"All authors have made substantial contributions to and have approved the final manuscript.

SARS-CoV-2, one of the five human coronaviruses of Betacoronavirus genius. While the aetiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not completely known, it has been reported that host cell entry is mediated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Xu et al., 2020), a protein expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma (Jia et al., 2020). As a result, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact, making it highly contagious.\", \"As of March 2020, more than 700,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 200 countries/territories. Upon the development of the pandemic, the number of deaths is expected to rise with elderly more vulnerable to fatality. A crude fatality ratio of 22% has been observed in Chinese patients aged above 80 years, much higher than the national overall of 3.8%, concluded from 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases (WHO, 2020).\", \"Unlike other respiratory diseases that have a “U”-shaped lethality curve (Raoult et al., 2020), mortality of COVID-19 increased with age while children were observed less susceptible to death. Despite the observation of increased vulnerability in elderly, literature concerning geriatric patients with COVID-19 remained very scant. Most of the studies were editorial commentaries (Nicol et al., 2020; Garnier-Crussard et al., 2020; Le Couteur et al., 2020; Doraiswamy et al., 2020) and clinical studies of a cohort of patients of varying ages admitted to a hospital with a slight highlight on the association between age and clinical manifestations (Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Given that elderly aged 60 or above only accounted for about 6% of the total Chinese population, clinical studies based on a single hospital may not be informative. Against this background, the present study identified the risk factors for predicting mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19 by reviewing the clinical data of deceased and discharged COVID-19 patients gathered from the public domain.\", \"Elderly patients were defined as those diagnosed with COVID-19 of age 60 or above. Due to data availability, clinical data of individuals reported by the media and Chinese health authorities were sought by performing a search on Google. Two searches were performed, one with the search terms “death”, “pneumonia” and “age” for the clinical data of deceased patients whereas the other with the search terms “discharge”, “pneumonia” and “age” for the clinical data of surviving patients that served as controls. The inclusion criteria were (i) elderly patients diagnosed with COVID-19, (ii) exact date of discharge or death, and (iii) symptoms on admission. There was no language restriction.\", \"The following data were collected: (i) gender, (ii) age, (iii) travel history to Hubei, (iv) time from symptom onset to admission, (v) time from admission to discharge/death, (vi) symptoms on admission and (vii) comorbidities. Only the comorbidities of deceased patients were included as that of surviving patients were usually not reported by the media.\", \"Statistical tests on the difference in measures (i) to (vi) between the deceased and surviving patient groups were performed and a logistic regression model was estimated to identify risk factors for mortality with the stepwise regression procedure for independent variable selection.\", \"A total of 154 individual cases in 26 provinces, including 89 deceased patients and 65 surviving patients, were identified from 86 sources originating from the official web pages of Chinese health authorities and the media under the supervision of the Chinese government such as Xinhua, Sina and the Paper. The data of 73 patients were abstracted from 22 government sources, defined as web pages with the domain “.gov”. Sina, Chinanews, People’s Daily and Xinhua were the other common sources, providing the data of 10, 7, 6, and 5 patients, respectively. Most cases were reported in Hubei (40 cases), followed by Shanghai (33 cases) and Henan (10 cases). Table 1, Table 2\\nillustrate the results.\", \"Gender did not appear to be a mortality risk factor as demonstrated by the insignificant difference in the male proportion between the deceased and surviving group. However, age played an important role as shown by the significant difference. The difference in the proportion between the two groups varied as age increased. The proportion of deceased patients aged 60-69 was significantly smaller than that of surviving patients (p < 0.001) whereas the proportion of deceased patients aged 80 or above was significantly larger than that of surviving patients (p = 0.014). The crude OR also increased as age increased. For patients of age 80 or above, the crude OR was significantly greater than one (Fig. 1\\n).\", \"Although the median time from symptom onset to admission was longer in deceased patients, the difference was found insignificant. There was significant difference in the median time from admission to death/discharge with 50% of the deceased patients expired within nine days after admission.\", \"It is not surprising that cough and fever were the most commonly seen symptoms in patients with COVID-19. While cough was equally observed in both groups, deceased patients were less susceptible to fever. There was no significant difference in symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection between the two groups, including cough, sore throat and nasal congestion/rhinorrhea. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection were more prominent in deceased patients. In comparison with surviving patients, deceased patients had approximately six-fold and three-fold higher prevalence of dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort, respectively. Another interesting observation was the prominence of muscle ache in deceased patients. The difference in other symptoms such as chill and diarrhea was found insignificant.\", \"Age, fever and diarrhea were selected by the stepwise regression procedure in the logistic regression model. With the exception of diarrhea, the adjusted OR of age and fever were found significantly different from one. While older age was associated with mortality (adjusted OR = 1.04), fever was less likely to occur in deceased patients (adjusted OR = 0.23).\", \"The most commonly observed comorbidities in deceased patients were hypertension (53.2%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (42.0%), and diabetes (37.8%). Other comorbidities such as liver and neurological diseases were unlikely to be associated with mortality given the low prevalence observed.\", \"Given that elderly only accounted for a small proportion of the total Chinese population and that clinical studies based on a single hospital are less likely informative, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources reported by the media and Chinese health authorities.\", \"Findings suggested by the baseline characteristics of the patients were generally in line with existing studies. Advanced age remained associated with mortality as documented in literature (Leung, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The present study further enhanced the understanding of mortality by age stratification in geriatric patients. Furthermore, the inclusion of age in the logistic regression model suggested that it was an independent risk factor for mortality.\", \"The significant difference in time from admission to final clinical outcome between the two groups shed light on the clinical course of elderly patients. Although half of the deceased patients expired within nine days after admission, half of all surviving patients were discharged at least 17 days after admission, suggestive of long and erratic clinical course of geriatric patients.\", \"It is not surprising to see higher prevalence of dyspnoea in deceased patients. Pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnoea and haemoptysis have usually been observed in patients with severe pneumonia, regardless of age. A study of 138 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 aged between 22 and 92 years old found that dyspnoea was more commonly seen in patients admitted to ICU (Wang et al., 2020a). In contrast, the prominence of muscle ache in deceased patients was unusual. Muscle ache in patients with COVID-19 was not common and was only reported in two clinical studies. It was seen in 11% of 99 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital between 1st and 20th January 2020 (Chen et al., 2020). In a study describing 28 COVID-19 cases confirmed in South Korea, 14% of the patients were reported to have muscle ache (COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center, 2020).\", \"While the lower prevalence of fever in deceased patients was surprising, a study of 913 patients (75% of them aged 65 or above) with bacterial infection found that lower body temperature was associated with increased risk for mortality (Yamamoto et al., 2006). In fact, the data in the present study suggested that patients without fever were more likely to be older (crude OR 0.952. 95% CI 0.910, 0.996). This phenomenon is not uncommon and perhaps overlooked. A recent study reviewing the clinical features of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hainan General Hospital found significant difference in the prevalence of fever between young and middle-aged, and elderly patients (Liu et al., 2020). However, the authors did not further discuss this finding. It has also been suggested that approximately 20%-30% of elderly patients with serious bacterial or viral infection presented with a blunted or even no fever (Norman, 2000). It is likely because of the lower baseline body temperature in elderly due to aging (Castle et al., 1991; Obermeyer et al., 2017; Güneş and Zaybak, 2008; Lu et al., 2010; Simonsick et al., 2016) which may translate to a lower maximum temperature of fever (Norman, 2000). This suggests that the usual temperature threshold for fever should not be used as a case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients. In fact, a study on a total of 111 nursing home residents found that lowering the threshold for a clinically significant fever increased the sensitivity of detecting infections (Castle et al., 1993). However, it is not recommended to lower the temperature threshold in the case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients because an individual’s baseline body temperature is also determined by a range of demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and physiological measurements (Obermeyer et al., 2017). To assist surveillance against the current pandemic, elderly should measure on a regular basis the baseline body temperature that can be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. If this is not feasible, a baseline body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius might be used instead (Güneş and Zaybak, 2008).\", \"Studies concerning the association between comorbid conditions and mortality/disease severity in the Chinese COVID-19 patients of all ages showed mixed results. In a study including 140 patients admitted to No.7 Hospital of Wuhan, no significant difference in the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease was observed between severe and non-severe patients (Zhang et al., 2020). In contrast, the opposite was observed between 54 deceased and 137 surviving patients admitted to Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Zhou et al., 2020). The difference in the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease between the two groups was significant even at 1% level of significance.\", \"For COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or above, the data of the present study may shed some light on the association between comorbidities and mortality, despite without a control. A recent hypertension prevalence study in the Chinese population found that hypertension was observed in 58.4% of Chinese aged 60 or above (Lu et al., 2017) which falls between 41.6% and 64.5%, the 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients with hypertension (Table 2). Therefore, whether mortality is associated with hypertension in geriatric patients remains uncertain. Similar observations were found in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and stroke. The prevalence of COPD and stroke in the Chinese population aged 60 or above were found to be 15.5% (Zhong et al., 2007) (or higher given the recent increasing trend (Wang et al., 2018)) and 11%-14% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively. The 95% CI of the prevalence of COPD and stroke in the deceased patients considered in the present study were 7.8%-25.4% and 5.7%-21.8%, respectively. In contrast, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) might be associated with mortality. The prevalence of diabetes and CHD in the Chinese population aged 60 or above was found 19%-21% (Wang et al., 2017) and 6%-7% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively, failing to overlap with the corresponding 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients included in the present study.\", \"Finally, the results presented here were somewhat different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), despite genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In a study aiming to discuss the clinical manifestations and prognosis of patients with SARS aged 60 or above, age, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia were identified by the crude OR as mortality risk factors whereas no independent mortality risk factors were found by the logistic regression (Cao et al., 2003). The present study, however, found that age and fever were mortality risk factors. To conclude, further research should be done to identify comorbidities associated with mortality given very diverse results in existing literature.\", \"The major limitation of the present work is that only baseline characteristics were considered as mortality risk factors. Because of the lack of data, lab findings and physiological measures were left unstudied.\", \"The author declares no conflict of interest.\"],\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"sciwingI2B2\": {\n

[\"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging lethal respiratory disease from December 2019 [1]. Full-genome sequencing analysis has indicated that the pathogen is a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. Since first identified, the epidemic scale of the recently emerged COVID-19 has increased rapidly, with cases arising across China and other countries [3,4].\", \"Recently, a few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [1,5]. Huang et al indicated that 32% of patients were admitted to an ICU and 15% of patients died among the 41 hospitalized patients, and the ICU patients had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines [1]. Wang et al proved that patients treated in the ICU were older men with comorbidities, dyspnea, and anorexia compared with those not treated in the ICU among 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [6]. Nevertheless, the predictive risk factors for the poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\", \"We, therefore, collected the data of clinical manifestations together with detailed laboratory examination and attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\", \"The laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted to Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 13 to February 16 in 2020 were enrolled. All patients were diagnosed based on the WHO guidance [6]. We excluded the patients who were prescribed corticosteroids or immunosuppressant within 14 days before admission, procalcitonin level more than 0.5 ug/L, and influenza, bacteria, or fungi infection revealed by nasal and pharyngeal swab cultures on admission. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and complied with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was waived because of the urgent situation and the retrospective nature by the ethics commission.\", \"A total of 111 patients were included. The medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, radiologic assessments, laboratory findings on admission, and treatment strategies were extracted and cross-checked from electronic medical records. Comorbidities included hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, and malignancy. Numbers of pulmonary lobe involved were evaluated by chest computed tomography on admission. Laboratory tests on admission comprised complete blood count, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by the RT-PCR assay conducted in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO [7]. All laboratory tests were performed using commercial kits in the department of clinical laboratory of Union Hospital. The preliminary assessment of disease severity was developed by 6-category ordinal scale of clinical status on admission as follows: category 6, death; 5, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation; 4, ICU hospitalization, not requiring ECMO and/or invasive mechanical ventilation; 3, non-ICU hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen; 2, non-ICU hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 1, hospital discharge [8].\", \"The primary outcome was the disease deterioration, including the transfer from isolation ward to ICU and all-cause death. The included patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical outcomes: group with favorable prognosis (discharge after recovery) and group with poor prognosis (disease deterioration).\", \"Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared with χ² test or Fisher’s exact test between discharged and deteriorated group. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Odds ratio (OR) for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression adjusted for selected confounders: age, gender, comorbidity, body temperature, number of pulmonary lobe involved, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein level, IL-6 level, and IL-10 level on admission. For this analysis, the upper limit of IQRs of this cohort was used as the cut-off values for age (57 years), CRP (39.0 mg/L), IL-6 (15.7 pg/ml), and IL-10 (5.1 pg/ml), respectively. A two-tailed p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).\", \"The clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1\\n. The median age was 38.0 years (IQR, 32.0 to 57.0), and 46 (41.4%) patients were males. 33.3% of patients had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, and chronic liver disease). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (71.2%), cough (37.8%), fatigue (18.0%), and dyspnea (16.2%). Symptoms including diarrhea (9.0%), pharyngalgia (6.3%), myalgia (6.3%), and headache (3.6%) were rare. The median duration from illness onset to admission was 7 days (IQR, 5.0 to 10.0). Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged, and 18 patients were deteriorated, although there was no significant difference in scale of clinical status on admission between these two groups. Of the 18 deteriorated patients, 15 patients had died and 3 patients remained hospitalized in ICU up to Feb 26th, 2020.\", \"Compared with the discharged patients, the deteriorated patients were significantly older (median age, 36.0 years [IQR, 31.0-47.5]) vs 60.0 years [IQR, 48.5-81.5], have more underlying comorbidities (22 [23.7%] vs 15 [83.3%]), and were more likely to report dyspnea (9 [9.7%] vs 9 [50.0%]). Days from illness onset to admission were not different between discharged and deteriorated patients. Increased proportions of elevated body temperature, respiratory frequency, and systolic pressure were higher in the deteriorated group compared with the discharged group.\", \"\\nTable 2\\nshows the laboratory findings on admission. White blood cell counts (6.51 G/L [4.03-10.10] vs 3.97 G/L [3.14-5.72]) and neutrophil counts (5.68 G/L [3.10-9.37] vs 2.34 G/L [1.82-3.51]) were higher, whereas lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) were lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The proportions of liver dysfunction (12 [66.67%] vs 21 [22.58%]) were increased in the deteriorated patients compared with the discharged patients. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), CRP (79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 pg/ml (35.72 [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with the discharged patients.\", \"During hospitalization, the treatments of these patients were adjusted according to the patient's condition (Table 3\\n). All patients received antiviral therapy, mostly antibacterial therapy. Corticosteroids were given to 27.0% of cases, and more in dead cases than discharged cases (88.9% vs 15.1%). All the deteriorated patients required mechanical ventilation, and ECMO was employed in one severe case.\", \"The main baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics by CRP quartiles are shown in Table 4\\n. The patients with elevated CRP levels had a greater proportion of comorbidity and dyspnea. Age, lymphopenia, IL-6/IL-10 concentrations, and the numbers of pulmonary lobe involved were increased with the rising CRP level. And most of the deteriorated patients (88.9%) were divided into the last quartile of CRP levels (>39.00 mg/L).\", \"The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis are shown in Table 5\\n. The 14 significant variables were included. After adjusted, male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were found as the significant risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.\", \"We report here a cohort of 111 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, upper respiratory tract signs and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, suggesting different viral tropism as compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9,10].\", \"Among these 111 patients in isolation ward at baseline, 93 (83.8%) patients were discharged, and 18 (16.2%) were deteriorated. Those patients with poor prognosis were older male patients with more comorbidities, dyspnea, higher neutrophil count, lower lymphocyte count, more liver dysfunction, and increased numbers of pulmonary lobe involved from chest CT images. Moreover, we noted that patients with poor prognosis also had high amounts of CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 on admission. For further multivariate analysis of these risk factors, male, comorbidity, lymphopenia, and obviously elevated CRP were the significant predictors of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.\", \"Hypertension was the dominant comorbidity in this study. The proportion of COVID-19 patients with hypertension was significantly increased in those with poor prognosis. Molecular modeling revealed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]. ACE2 could be up-regulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or blockade of Angiotensin II Receptors (ARB) in liver and heart [12,13]. Thus, an increased entry of coronaviruses into host cells might be found in COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension taking ACEI or ARB, resulting in the poor prognosis.\", \"Lymphopenia is a common feature of coronavirus infection [5,9,10]. Lymphocyte apoptosis directly induced by coronaviruses might be the major cause of lymphopenia [14,15]. Yang et al observed that as the SARS patients improved, T lymphocyte counts gradually returned to the normal ranges [16]. Thus, lymphopenia is temporally associated with disease severity [17].\", \"Besides the direct attack from virus, progressive inflammatory injury has been suggested as the possible mechanism in COVID-19 [1]. CRP is a downstream acute phase protein in the innate immune response [18]. It is produced because of the increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate the immune response [19]. Therefore, serum CRP level has been often used as a laboratory marker of inflammation [18,19]. A few studies indicated that CRP is a predictive factor for disease progression in MERS-CoV- and H1N1- infected patients [20,21]. In this study, we first reported that CRP could also be the predictor for the progression of COVID-19.\", \"In view of the excessive inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infections, corticosteroids are used for the treatment of patients with severe illness to reduce inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests the significant effect of corticosteroids on mortality [22,23]. As different from the extensive anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids, the drugs specific for inflammasome/IL-1β/IL-6/CRP axis might show their advantages [24,25]. Thus, CRP might not only be the predictor for the poor prognosis but also an indicator for anti-inflammatory therapy.\", \"There are some limitations in this study. First, this is a single center study with a small sample size. The 95% CI of OR is relatively large. Second, it is a retrospective study, and the results need to be further verified by prospective studies. Third, we aimed to study the risk factors of prognosis. But the sample size in the poor prognosis group is small. Moreover, we were unable to analyze the differences in clinical characteristics of patients in the poor prognosis group due to the small sample size. Fourth, we missed asymptomatic and mild cases managed at home, and hence our cohort might represent the more severe population of COVID-19. Fifth, a few risk factors such as viral load, viral antibody titers, and cause of death were not available in this study. Sixth, the treatment of these patients was clinically driven and not unified standard.\", \"In conclusions, male gender, comorbidity, lymphopenia, and elevated CRP are the risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Our findings would facilitate the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients, especially in primary hospitals.\", \"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rapidly increasing globally. As of April 5, 2020, more than 1.2 million cases have been confirmed and ~70,000 deaths have been reported in ~180 countries. 1 Several studies have rapidly provided crucial data (e.g., incubation period) related to various aspects of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 : severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. 2 However, risk factors for the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 are poorly understood. Such information is critical to identify high risk patients and to facilitate planning (e.g., forecasting the need for hospital beds and mechanical ventilators). These risk factors will also have implications for workforce allocation (e.g., assignment of healthcare providers with specific risk factors to positions with reduced risk of exposure to .\",\"To date, several studies have reported that a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and traditional CVD risk factors, e.g., age, male sex, current smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, are associated with severe COVID-19. However, other than age, results have been inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies accounted for potential confounding by age and sex when they evaluated other potential risk factors. For example, some studies reported that hypertension is a risk factor of severe COVID-19, but their observations may simply reflect the fact that hypertension is more common in older adults. 3 Nonetheless, despite the lack of robust evidence, this observation, together with the fact SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as an entry to human body, 4 has raised a concern about continued use of reninangiotensin system increase among some clinicians and researchers. 5, 6 In this context, we conducted a systematic review of studies reporting cardiovascular risk factors and their relation to severe manifestation of COVID-19 (i.e., death, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] , the need of mechanical ventilator support, and admission to an intensive care unit [ICU]), with a particular interest on studies that adjusted for key confounders such as age and sex.\",\".

We confirmed a robust association of age and male sex with severe COVID-19. Their contributions are likely to be independent of each other. A few studies demonstrated positive associations of current smoking with severe COVID-19. Several studies reported that pre-existing CVD, hypertension, and diabetes were also associated with severe COVID-19. However, only two studies that reported estimates for these comorbidities adjusted for age and/or sex. One study found that the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19 was no longer statistically significant after age adjustment, 25 whereas the other showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in analyses that adjusted for age and a few other comorbidities. 17 Although the primary estimate was not statistically significant, our metaregression analyses indicated some degree of confounding by age, but not necessarily by sex, for the associations of hypertension, diabetes, and prior CVD with severe COVID-19.\",\"The positive association of sociodemographic factors (age, male sex, and smoking) with severe COVID-19 is consistent with reports of other infectious diseases (e.g., influenza virus and SARS in 2003). [27] [28] [29] There are several plausible mechanisms. Older age is linked to reduced immune reaction, more comorbidities, and limited organ reserve. 3, 27, 30 Male sex is related to higher prevalence of comorbidities, less frequency of washing hands, and immunological disadvantage given X-chromosome coding proteins in the immune system, 2,31,32 whereas smoking can damage respiratory system. 33 In our meta-analysis, we confirmed overall positive crude associations of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes with severe COVID-19, with pooled relative risk estimates around 3-.

An important question is whether these associations are independent of major confounders, particularly age. Although we could not obtain a definite answer as very few studies ran multivariable models, our meta-regression analysis indicated some degree of confounding by age. One study by Zhou et al showed substantial attenuation of the association between coronary heart disease and severe COVID-19. On the other hand, Liang et al showed independent associations of hypertension and diabetes with severe COVID-19 in a relatively large sample size of 1,590 patients. These is also biologic plausibility. Hypertension and diabetes are leading risk factors for CVD and kidney diseases, and there is evidence that COVID-19 damages these organs. 34, 35 Available studies provide scant evidence related to the hypothesized adverse effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on severity of COVID-19 infection. As noted above, there is biological plausibility for potential associations of COVID-19 with hypertension and diabetes, two comorbidities associated with use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Only one study reported the prevalence of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors use. 13 In this study, ~30% of patients reported prevalent hypertension, but only ~5% of patients were taking renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. 13 Thus, it is reasonable that many expert organizations recommend continuing this category of medications until better evidence becomes available. 4 Our results can potentially be used to guide decision-making. While the lack of discrete age thresholds for severe COVID-19 complicates this process, data on case fatality rates from three countries (Web Table 2 ) suggest that age older than 60 or 65 years confers high risk of severe COVID-19 (relative risk > ~5 compared to <50 years). Our results also indicate male sex is an independent risk factor with a pooled relative risk of ~1.7. Although it is very likely that the pooled crude relative risk of ~3-3.5 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD overestimate their impact beyond age and sex, all or some of them may each confer 1.5-2 times greater risk. Thus, using these factors, it is possible to estimate, at least crudely, the risk of severe COVID-19. For example, a man aged 60-65 years old, with either hypertension, diabetes, or prior CVD would .

Such information could be used to inform decisions on testing for COVID-19, clinical management of COVID-19, and workforce planning.\",\"Our study has some limitations. First, reflecting the fact that the outbreak started from China, most studies were from China. However, given similar case-fatality rates and clinical manifestations across different countries, it seems likely that these results are largely generalizable. Nonetheless, we need to acknowledge regional variations of some risk factors (e.g., ~25-fold difference in the prevalence of smoking in men vs. women in China 36 ) and thus future investigations in different regions would be valuable. Second, we did not include non-English publications. Third, most studies reported odds ratios, which are known to overestimate risk ratio when the prevalence of exposures is relatively high. Fourth, we cannot deny the possibility that some patients were included in multiple studies especially in the China CDC report 14 and other Chinese studies. Nonetheless, the pooled estimates were largely similar in analyses that excluded the China CDC data (data not shown). Finally, the literature of COVID-19 is growing rapidly, and thus there is a lag time from our literature search and publication. On the other hand, our systematic review has several strengths: in-depth review of CVD and its risk factors, a clinically relevant definitions of severe COVID-19 that minimize subjective reporting, meta-regression to explore potential confounding, and relatively short elapsed time of ~2 weeks between the literature search and manuscript submission.\",\"In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis found robust associations of older age and male sex as risk factors of severe COVID-19. Few studies reported the association between current smoking and severe COVID-19. In unadjusted analyses, hypertension, diabetes, and prior CVD were significantly associated with severe COVID-19.\",\"However, only two-studies conducted age-adjusted analyses, with one relatively large study showing independent contributions of hypertension and diabetes to severe COVID-19.

the first report of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the novel virus infection has rapidly spread to other cities in China, and has now been detected in 186 countries and locations internationally [1] . On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genetic sequence [2] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3] [4] . With the escalated spread of the infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5] [6] . The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue [5] [6] [7] [8] , with presence of asymptomatic, yet contagious cases [9] .\",\"According to the COVID-19 situation reports of WHO, as of March 29 th , 2020, the infection has caused 81,445 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 3,300 deaths.\",\"Internationally, a total of 601,020 confirmed cases have been reported from 186 countries outside of China, including 28,747 deaths. Considering the global public health threat posed by COVID-19, unraveling the prognostic factors for patients, especially the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19, has important implications for clinical practice and is urgently warranted.\",\"Studies have indicated that severe cases tend to be older in age [6, 8] and are more likely to have had pre-existing medical conditions, including but not limited to hypertension [3, 6, 8] , diabetes [6, 8] , cardiovascular diseases [3, 6, 8, [10] [11] [12] , cerebrovascular diseases [6] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3, 8] , cancer [13] , and digestive diseases [14] , in comparison to non-severe cases [3, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Recently, scholarly attention focuses on identifying the risk factors for death from COVID-19. Some evidence suggests that pre-existing medical conditions are likely death risk factors for COVID- 19 . For example, a study based on 72,314 cases in China indicated that the case-fatality rate (CFR) tends to be higher among those with older age, and having pre-existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension compared to all the patients [9] .

First, most current research on pre-existing comorbidities of COVID-19 was based on univariate comparison, which did not account for important confounders such as age and gender [17] [18] [19] [20] .

The risk factors are likely different inside and outside of Hubei Province, since current research has found that the clinical symptom severity [5] and the fatality-case rate [9, 21] to be higher in Hubei Province (the center of outbreak) than cities outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourth, no studies thus far have taken into account the pandemic stage when evaluating mortality risk factors. It has been found that average daily attack rate in China was different before and after January 11 th 2020, since non-pharmaceutical interventions were taken by the government before this date [22] . The change of pandemic stage may also influence the risk factors for fatality associated with COVID-19.\",\"To fill the above research gaps in the existing literature about the morality risk factors for COVID-19, the present study conducted a nested case-control (NCC) study, aiming to evaluate the risk of the common pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and etc.) for mortality associated with COVID-19 in mainland China outside of Hubei Province. NCC, also called risk set sampling, has been widely used in studying the fatal disease risk effect in large pharmacoepidemiologic studies [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] and risk prediction in pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) [29] .

The study period was from December 18 th , 2019, when the first laboratoryconfirmed case was announced in China, till March 8 th , 2020.\",\"The study cohort was defined as all the publicly reported confirmed COVID-19 patients outside of Hubei Province in mainland China between the study period. During this period, 112 deaths outside of Hubei Province were reported by the National Health Committee of China, and 18 were excluded from the present study due to missingness of important clinical information. A total of 448 publicly reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (94 deaths and 354 survivors) were initially collected. The data collection procedure was blinded to patient comorbidity information. All deaths were included as cases, and each case was matched with up to three controls on gender and age ± 1 year old (94 cases and 181 controls).

Median ages were similar to mean ages in both groups. A majority (62.9%) of the patients were male. Overall, 25.5% of the total patients had clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 before January 11 th , 2020. A relatively small proportion of the total sample had COPD, renal failure, history of surgery and hepatic failure (4.4%, 4.4%, 3.6% or 1.1%).

After adjusting for age, gender, and early period of pandemic in China, CHD was the only comorbidity that yielded a significant death risk: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD had an estimated 2.9 times death risk of those without CHD. In addition, cerebral infarction, COPD, and renal failure all had an estimated HR of around 2.0, respectively. Similar results were observed by using unweighted logistic regression in a sensitivity analysis (Appendix Table A2 ).\",\"The overall median follow-up was 40 days, during which 94 deaths were observed. \",\"In this paper, we used survival analysis to estimate the fatal risk of pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19, based on publicly reported confirmed cases and adjusted for the confounding effect of age, gender, and early period of the pandemic when no-intervention was taken. There were three major findings: First, a history of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% increase of death risk (p<0.001). Second, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was the only significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Patients with CHD had a 200% higher risk of mortality in COVID-19, compared to patients without CHD (p<0.001). For a patient profile (65-\",\"year-old female without other comorbidities), the estimated median survival times for those with CHD was 34 days, while it was over 70 days for those without CHD (p<0.001). Third, older age was associated with increased death risk.

It is worth pointing out that the existing studies [9, 16] that investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression that does not control for potential confounders. In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offers more survivaltime-related information to help guide the clinical intervention and more statistical power to detect risk factors [33] [34] .\",\"Previous studies have indicated that cardiovascular events following pneumonia may increase the risk of mortality [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , which explained our findings from the point view of pathophysiological mechanisms. One potential mechanism underlying the association between pneumonia and cardiovascular events is inflammation [38] . Specifically, the inflammatory reaction following pneumonia can result in plague instability and damage in the blood vessels, where evidence of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary arteries following acute systemic infections have been shown in many studies [38, 40] . Thus, infections may result in heightened loading imposed on cardiomyocytes, and lead to sympathetic hyperactivity, ischemia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia and heart failure in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD [37] .\",\"Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more research, potentially prospective studies, are needed to investigate the mechanism by which pre-existing CHD may influence the survival probability among patients with COVID-19. From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to implement early medical interventions and decrease the mortality risk. We suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patients with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had preexisting heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention may be needed [41] .\",\"Furthermore, our results indicated that the hazard of COVID-19 death was significantly higher in patients at older ages. Adjusting for others, every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 22% increased risk of death, similarly to what was found in previous studies [8, 9, 16] .\",\"Alongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra care is needed for those with CHD, especially for elderly patients.\",\"The design of excluding patients from Hubei Province was based on the concerns of unknown confounders caused by insufficient medical resources in the epicenter.

Therefore, analyzing patient data outside of Hubei Province can avoid the competing death risk caused by insufficient health care resources, and reveal the true underlying impact of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality [44] .\",\"One limitation of the present study lies in the nature of publicly reported data.\",\"Researchers have pointed out that severe cases may be over-represented in publicly reported data [45] . Nevertheless, we have managed to reduce the potential bias caused by severe case overrepresentation, through the appropriate matching between cases and controls in NCC design. The auto-matching procedure via statistical program also prevented the possibility of tendentiously selecting survivors with comorbidity-free history during data collection. In addition, NCC design is favored in our situation where the risk factor data and event of interest can be identified opportunistically from publicly reported confirmed cases [30] . Therefore, NCC was the optimal choice, given the restricted availability of public data.\",\"In conclusion, our findings provided preliminary yet strong evidence supporting the association between pre-existing CHD and mortality risk for patients with COVID-19. Based on our findings, close monitoring, extra care, and early medical intervention are needed for patients with pre-existing CHD, to reduce the mortality risk associated with COVID-19.\",\"The authors have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial or non-financial interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Male patients infected with SARS-cov-2 showed as an independent risk factor for getting severer condition as 3.76 (1. 12-12.73 ). Apart from the risk factors above, APACHE II score, PSI score, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, serum AST, ALT, LDH, Urea, CRP, BNP level, PT, APTT were all associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients.

Based on the condition we mentioned, laboratory indictors CRP, AST and LDH (P < 0.001) were chosen as the three variables for multivariable logistic regression model. As a result, serum LDH level was ruled out as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 patients (OR:1.02, 95% CI:1.01-1.03, P < 0.05) ( Table 3 ).\",\"We used clinical severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) to assess the disease severity in COVID-19 patients. The average APACHE II score was 9.9 in severe cases versus 4.7 in non-severe cases, with SOFA score of 3.0 versus 1.0 (Table 1 , P < 0.001). For the predivtive factors we have speculated, lymphocyte cell counts, hepatic function indicator AST, infection indicator CRP and myocardial injury biomarkers cTnI, BNP as well as LDH were performed Pearson correlation ananalysis with APACHE II score and SOFA score. We found that serum LDH level showed tightly positive correlation of the highest R value respevtively with APACHE II (R = 0.682, P < 0.001) and SOFA score (R = 0.790, P < 0.001) in all the indicators (Figure1. F&L). Apart from lymphocyte cells showed a negative correlation with APACHE II (R = -0.593, P < 0.001) and SOFA score (R = -0.614, P < 0.001), other indicators CRP, AST and BNP were also positively associated with the scores. It's worth noting that, the serum cTnI level showed a positive correlation with SOFA score (R = 0.345, P = 0.025) while it showed no correlation with APACHE II score (R = 0.292, P = 0.06). (Figure 1 ).\",\"We used PSI and the Curb-65 score to assess the disease severity of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The average PSI score was 86 in severe cases versus 61 in nonsevere cases (Table 1 , P = 0.003), with Curb-65 scores of 1.13 versus 0.48 (Table 1 , P = 0.001). We also evaluated the extent of inflammation on chest CT using a semiquantitative scoring system (Supplement Table 1 ); the median score was 5.0 in severe cases while only 2.0 in non-severe cases ( Table 1 , P < 0.001). Six indicators above were futher performed Pearson correlation ananalysis with PSI score and CT score to determine the potential biomarkers for the lung injury. As a result, the serum LDH level still showed the highest R value with CT score (R = 0.8372, P < 0.001) and the second highest R value with PSI score (R = 0.465, P < 0.001) in all the indicators (Figure2. F&L). Nevertheless, the serum cTnI level showed no correlation with PSI score (R = 0.203, P = 0.198) nor CT score (R = 0.232, P = 0.167). What's more, the serum AST level showed no correlation with PSI score (R = 0.211, P = 0.165) and the serum BNP level showed no correlation CT score (R = 0.301, P = 0.837). Lymphocyte counts were neagtively associated with PSI score (R = -0.434, P = 0.003) and CT score (R = -0.602, P < 0.001), while serum CRP showed positvie correlation with the two scores.

Although the clinical characteristics of patients enrolled were somewhat akin to those reported in previous studies (1, 5, 7) , there were no differences in age, BMI, and proportion with underlying diseases between severe and non-severe patients, as well as smoking history. In concert with recent studies (1, 5, 9) , we found that the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 mimic those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the dominant symptoms, and both groups had similar days from symptom onset, similar maximum temperature, and number of patients who had dyspnea. APACHE II and SOFA scores were calculated based on admission data. PSI, CURB-65, and the semiquantitative score were used to assess the severity of lung damage.\",\"Significantly higher scores were found in severe cases.\",\"Among the risk factors we investigated in this study, we surprisingly discovered that LDH had the most positive relationship between both PSI and CT score. In addition, it was also most positively relevant to APACHE II and SOFA scores, which reflected a strong correlation between LDH with lung damage as well as disease severity. LDH is a major player in glucose metabolism which is present in tissues throughout the body and catalyzes pyruvate to lactate. It is released from cells upon damage of their cytoplasmic membrane (10) . Previous studies also had noted the importance of LDH as an indicator of lung diseases. In a study on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), researchers found that EBV infected B cells had more LDH transcripts than the uninfected B cells (11) . In addition, the serum levels of LDH increased in PcP patients, probably was due to lung injury (12, 13) . Among patients who were infected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 77.8% whose laboratory test showed LDH > 225U/L had lung involvement, without difference between adult and children (14) , which indicated that LDH elevation was associated with various pathogen including virus, and was relevant to lung injury.\",\"Furthermore, there was a case reported in 2017 that a patient with human Zika virus infection had markedly elevated LDH, which was associated with 70% mortality in All rights reserved.

They considered LDH as an indicator of multiorgan injury, not only affecting liver or cardiac function(15).\",\"LDH is found in all human cells, especially in myocardial and liver cells. In our study, LDH elevation was positively associated with AST, cTnI and BNP, which verified it as an isozyme of heart and liver. However, it was somewhat surprising that cTnI was neither associated with PSI nor CT semiquantitative score, while was relevant with disease severity. Similarly, BNP that had a strong correlation with APACHE II and SOFA, was not associated with CT semiquantitative score, either. Furthermore, AST which was associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score, was not related to PSI score. This rather intriguing finding might be explained by the fact that the myocardial and liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the direct damage of the virus to targeted organs, while not because of hypoxia induced by lung injury. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, structural analysis of the virus has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans(16, 17). The ACE2 receptor is abundantly present in the epithelia of lung and small intestine(18), which might provide possible routes of entry for SARS-CoV-2.\",\"This epithelial expression, together with its presence in vascular endothelium(18), also provides a step in understanding the pathogenesis of ARDS, cardiac injury, liver injury and even MODS.\",\"Furthermore, LDH was found to be positively associated with CRP and negatively with\",\"lymphocytes. An increase in CRP and decrease in lymphocytes were observed in severe cases during the 14-day observation period, which was consistent with findings of recent reports (1, 5, 6) . In our study, the development of lymphopenia in severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells, but not to B cells or NK cells. The decrease of T cells in severe cases reached its trough within three days, and then slightly increased from the first week while still maintaining low levels and not recovering to the level of nonsevere patients over two weeks (data not shown).\",\"All rights reserved.

Suppression of LDH has anti-inflammatory effects due to the downregulation of several inflammatory mediators including cytokines and NO(23).\",\"Also, significant correlations were found between LDH and cytokines/chemokines, therefore, LDH may be a useful biomarker to assist the clinician in the decision to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis(24). In our study, lymphocytes, especially CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells were significantly decreased and relevant with LDH elevation.\",\"The decrease in T cell counts was strongly correlated with the severity of disease, which was in keeping with previous studies on SARS(25, 26). On the other hand, elevation of LDH, the immune-related factor, could be considered as a predictive factor, that reflected a poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients.\",\"Our study had some limitations. This study was conducted at a single-center with limited sample size. Furthermore, because many patients remained in hospital and outcomes were unknown at the time of writing, we only collected clinical data within two weeks for our analysis.

of COVID-19 can be similar to those of worsening asthma, or an asthma exacerbation.

(14) As a result, the CDC lists moderate to severe asthma as a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.(14) However, to date the literature is ambiguous on whether pre-existing asthma increases the risk of either COVID-19 infection, or morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19, in children.\",\"The evidence on COVID-19 risk factors derives largely from the adult population. Four case series, all from Wuhan, China, of adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19 did not list asthma as an underlying pre-existing condition in any of those patients.(12,15, 16, 17) In a large case series of 1099 adult patients from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces in China, asthma was not listed as a pre-existing condition in any of the patients described.(18) In contrast, recent data released from the CDC of U.S. hospitalizations in March,2020 notes that 27.3% of adults 18-49 years of age who were hospitalized with COVID-19 had a history of asthma.(3) In adults aged 50-64 years of age hospitalized for COVID-19 asthma was present in 13.2% and in those 65 years or older asthma was present in 12.9%.(3,19) As a result, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) notes that ‘those with asthma in the 18-49 year old age range may be at increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19.’(19)\",\"Although there is a paucity of literature on pediatric risk factors, the case series to date from Wuhan on hospitalized pediatric cases don’t list asthma as a pre-existing risk factor for morbidity or mortality.(10,11) It is further reassuring that children appear to be at lower risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than the adult population in general, although severe infection still can occur.(13,20) The CDC morbidity and mortality report notes that among the 149,082 reported U.S. cases of COVID-19 for which age is known, only 2572 (1.7%) occurred in children 18 years and younger.(3) Although among the patients with information on underlying conditions, 23% had at least one underlying condition such as asthma, only 5.7% of children infected with COVID-19 required hospitalization (compared with 10% of adults aged 18-64 years) and only 3 deaths were reported in children (<1% of pediatric cases).

There is minimal literature on this risk from COVID-19, but there are data on the risk of asthma exacerbations triggered from other coronavirus infections, with mixed findings. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, did not cause an increase in asthma exacerbations in children during the 2002 epidemic, nor induce bronchial hyperreactivity or eosinophilic inflammation.(22) In fact, paradoxically, asthma exacerbations actually decreased during that time, which was attributed to improvements in hygiene measures related to the epidemic.(22) However, in contrast, non-epidemic coronaviruses are found commonly in the respiratory tracts of children with an asthma exacerbation and have contributed to bronchial hyper-reactivity and eosinophilic inflammation.(23, 24, 25, 26)\",\"In summary, based on available information to date, it is unclear whether there is a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity among asthmatic children.(8,9) It is also unknown whether asthma medications such as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or asthma biological therapies pose a risk in managing COVID-19 infections. Before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, larger scale data are required from pediatric populations, and from heterogeneous locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. It also remains unclear if COVID-19 increases the risk of asthma exacerbations. As a result, good asthma control is essential as a precautionary measure during this time.(8,9,13,20)\",\"In addition to the current burden of COVID-19, the spring season is often a time for asthma exacerbations due to emergence of seasonal aeroallergens, and other respiratory viruses.(27) The best way to prevent an exacerbation is consistent proper use of medicines to control asthma, such as inhaled corticosteroids and/or montelukast. As a result, children should remain on their current asthma medications during COVID-19.(8,9) This recommendation is supported by multiple international organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control, the Global Initiative for Asthma, and the North American consensus guideline on allergy care during COVID.(8,9,28,29) It is recommended that children not ‘step down’ any controller medication during this time unless ‘this is clearly favorable from an individual standpoint, with careful consideration of the balance between benefit and harm/burden.’(8) Other recommendations to maintain asthma control include avoiding known asthma triggers such as aeroallergens, frequent handwashing, physical distancing, and regular review of inhaler technique.(9,29) An exacerbation, if it occurred, ‘could require [children] to enter the healthcare system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.’(8)\",\"Some biologic agents, such as omalizumab (anti-IgE) and mepolizumab (anti-IL5), are approved for use in moderate to severe asthma in adolescents(30) The current recommendation for adolescents who are using these medications is to continue their use.(8) There is no current evidence that use of these medications increases the risk of COVID-19 infection or morbidity.\",\"If a child is using a nebulized asthma relief medication, this should be switched to a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (turbuhaler or diskus) under most circumstances.(8,9) Nebulization increases the risk of viral lower lung deposition.(8,9,31) It also increases the risk of infection transmission due to both stimulating a cough reflex, as well as generating ‘a high volume of respiratory aerosols that may be propelled over a longer distance than is involved in a natural dispersion pattern.’(31) It was poignantly noted in a recent editorial that ‘there is a possibility that nebulizer therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection can transmit potentially viable coronavirus to susceptible bystander hosts.’(31) The only possible reasons for a child to use a nebulizer at home during the COVID-19 pandemic are a poor response to a MDI/spacer, a child who is either uncooperative or unable to follow the directions required for MDI use, or medication shortages (which are discussed in more detail below).(8,9,31)\",\"The CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended against oral corticosteroid (OCS) use as a treatment for COVID-19.(32,33) This recommendation is based on experience with influenza, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), where OCS use prolonged viral replication and was associated with prolonged viral clearance, increased complication rates, increased risk of mechanical ventilation and higher mortality rates.(34, 35, 36, 37) It has been noted that OCS therapy increases the risk of nosocomial infection and secondary infection.(38) However, there is a distinction between OCS use as a therapy for COVID-19, and OCS use as a treatment of asthma exacerbations.(8) There is broad consensus that asthma exacerbations should be treated aggressively and in keeping with current guideline recommendations.(9) Multiple national and international organizations such as the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend OCS use as required, and in keeping with the child’s asthma action plan, during COVID-19.(8,9,28)\",\"The use of nebulized medications are especially discouraged in a healthcare setting, where infection transmission to other vulnerable patients is a risk.(9,31) If used, proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is required. It must also be considered that nebulized viral droplets can persist in the air for hours.(39)\",\"For any child with asthma who is having progressive or worsening symptoms, COVID-19 screening protocols must be used to help determine their level of risk as well as the need for COVID-19 testing at an appropriate facility.(8)\",\"For children hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation either documented or suspected to be associated with COVID-19 that is progressing, it might be decided to use one of the agents currently being considered in adults, for example, hydroxychloroquine.(40,41) or to seek compassionate release of remdesivir. There is no current data on the safety and efficacy of these agents in children and thus should be discussed in the setting of the hospital policy.(42,43) Although dosage of these medications in adolescents may be similar to adults, the appropriate adjustment for children under 12 years remains to be defined.\",\"\\nMedication shortages. There is a growing medication shortage across North America, including asthma medications such as albuterol.(39) In many cases, such as with albuterol, these medications increasingly are being used in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to help with respiratory issues. To help combat the shortage of albuterol specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic albuterol inhaler on April 8,2020.(44) If faced with albuterol shortage, other available options include substituting other short acting beta-agonists, using an expired albuterol inhaler, and ensuring good asthma control which reduces the need for reliever medications in general.(9,39) Many of the substitute short acting beta-agonists are dry powder inhalers (diskus or turbuhaler) and as such children often need to be at least 6 years of age to produce enough inspiratory force to use these devices properly.(9,45) For adolescents 12 years and older, another option is ICS-formoterol for both maintenance and relief therapy as supported by the Global Initiative for Asthma 2019 update.(46,47) Nebulized albuterol should only be considered as a last resort, and proper infection prevention protocols need to be followed.(8,9,31) If no other medications are available, epinephrine inhalers might be considered as well, if used prudently.\",\"\\nVirtual visits. With the need for significant healthcare resource reallocation, as well as shortages of PPE, much of the allergy/immunology specialty has converted to largely virtual visits, or visit deferral, during COVID-19.(8) Due to the need for almost exclusively virtual visits at this time, having a peak flow meter in homes may be helpful to diagnose an acute exacerbation at home, by comparing baseline measurements with those during highly symptomatic times. There are several advantages to virtual visits, including access to specialists, removing the transportation barrier required for an in-person visit, allowing those too sick to travel to connect with a healthcare provider, and most importantly in the current context, prevention of infection transmission with in-person visits.(48)\",\"Virtual visits should be prioritized for children who have poorly controlled asthma, have worsening asthma symptoms, or who have required dose escalations of their asthma medications in the past several months’ time.(8) It is recommended that follow-up visits for children with mild-to-moderate or well-controlled asthma be postponed during COVID-19, or converted to virtual visits if time permits.(8) It also is recommended that children of any asthma severity who have been well controlled for the past 6-12 months (no ER visits, <1 OCS dose, <2 exacerbations in the past 6-12 months) have visits deferred or converted to virtual visits (time permitting).(8) For children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations, an in-person visit likely is necessary but as noted in the joint North American guideline on COVID-19 and allergy contingency planning, ‘If the allergy/ immunology office does not have PPE available, it would be recommended that no patients with a co-potential for an asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 be seen at that office; the patient should instead be seen at another facility capable of COVID-19 isolation which is staffed and equipped to assess and manage asthma.’(8) Recommendations may be adjusted over time, based on the duration of COVID-19 and the time required for physical distancing.\",\"\\nAsthma Clinical Trials. It is currently recommended that entry into any asthma clinical trial be suspended during COVID-19.(8) For asthmatic children already participating in clinical trials, consideration could be given to virtual visits if possible.(8) Procedures that require forced expiratory maneuvers such as spirometry, methacholine challenge or induced sputum samples should be postponed in order to minimize staff risk and potential room contamination. Medication withdrawal as part of research protocols also should be deferred to a later time. Consideration should be given to telephone or telemedicine visits in order to limit exposure to a medical setting.\",\"\\nImpact of Social Determinants of Health on Asthma and COVID-19. There are many social determinants of health that have an impact on pediatric asthma morbidity including caregiver income, physical environment including exposure to second-hand smoke, access to health services, and race/ethnicity.(49, 50, 51) There is likely an interplay between some of these social determinants of health and the impact of COVID-19 on children with asthma. It has been suggested that exposure to second-hand smoke increases COVID-19 morbidity.(52,53) Of those hospitalized in the US for COVID-19, data from the CDC indicates that 33.1% were non-Hispanic black, while they only make up 18% of the catchment area population.(3) A recent editorial notes that low-income families are at higher risk of COVID-19 as low income jobs mostly can’t be performed remotely, often don’t pay sick days, are often not associated with insurance benefits and as a result it may not be possible for these families to afford the steps necessary for physical distancing.(54)\",\"Although the relationships between these variables needs to be further elucidated, it is possible that measures that impact social determinants of health, such as reducing exposure to second-hand smoke or improving healthcare access in low income neighborhoods, may improve prognosis in children with asthma who contract COVID-19. In addition, these families could benefit from counseling on having the appropriate amount of medications available for home during this period of restricted travel. In addition, they should check medications to be sure that none is expired.\",\"\\nImpact of COVID Restrictions. It is possible that children may not be severely affected by SARS-CoV-2 for some undefined reason to date, but they can still be carriers and could transmit virus to vulnerable people, including elderly relatives. Therefore, social distancing has included children, which has necessitated discontinuing school. It remains to be determined what impact this step has on children including those children with asthma. Often parents will discontinue medications in children during the summer months because they are doing well and they are out of school.(55) However, this year is different, because school was discontinued during the spring season, a time of seasonal allergen exacerbation and viral infection. School adds a certain structure to the day and there is some level of administration of asthma medication administration around the school day. Clinicians and parents should observe for potential breakdowns in adherence to controlling medications, especially in families in chaotic circumstances. The impact on education of home schooling, especially in families that lack an organizational structure remains to be seen. Finally, it has been suggested that school closure will increase the risk of childhood obesity, a known risk factor for worsening asthma.(56) Whether this occurs, and how this influences asthma control, also is yet unknown.\",\"In the face of unchartered territory and unprecedented times, there remains much to be learned about the impact of pediatric asthma on the course of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Although adult data suggest that asthma is a risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality such a risk in children is unclear. Differentiating COVID-19 from worsening asthma, or an asthma exacerbation, is challenging. As a result, pediatricians and families have an essential role in ensuring that children with asthma maintain good asthma control during this time. Children and adolescents with asthma should remain on their current asthma medications and practice physical distancing, regular handwashing, and aeroallergen avoidance. Treatment of asthma exacerbations should include oral corticosteroids if required. Nebulized medications are not recommended at this time due to increased risk of viral transmission. Healthcare providers should remain alert for changing policies and recommendations knowledge advances.\",\"\\n30..\"],\"tags\":{\"sciwingI2B2\":{\"0,0\":\"problem\",\"0,2\":\"problem\",\"0,9\":\"problem\",\"0,13\":\"problem\",\"0,15\":\"problem\",\"0,16\":\"problem\",\"0,18\":\"problem\",\"0,33\":\"problem\",\"0,50\":\"test\",\"0,51\":\"test\",\"1,2\":\"problem\",\"1,3\":\"problem\",\"1,4\":\"problem\",\"1,10\":\"problem\",\"1,13\":\"problem\",\"1,16\":\"problem\",\"1,21\":\"problem\",\"1,22\":\"problem\",\"1,23\":\"problem\",\"1,24\":\"problem\",\"1,31\":\"problem\",\"1,32\":\"problem\",\"1,44\":\"problem\",\"1,46\":\"problem\",\"1,50\":\"problem\",\"1,54\":\"problem\",\"1,56\":\"problem\",\"1,58\":\"problem\",\"1,62\":\"problem\",\"1,79\":\"problem\",\"1,80\":\"problem\",\"1,81\":\"problem\",\"2,3\":\"problem\",\"2,4\":\"problem\",\"2,10\":\"problem\",\"2,11\":\"problem\",\"2,13\":\"problem\",\"2,15\":\"problem\",\"2,16\":\"problem\",\"2,17\":\"problem\",\"2,26\":\"test\",\"2,28\":\"problem\",\"2,43\":\"problem\",\"2,44\":\"problem\",\"2,46\":\"problem\",\"3,6\":\"problem\",\"3,8\":\"problem\",\"3,11\":\"problem\",\"3,12\":\"problem\",\"3,18\":\"problem\",\"3,20\":\"problem\",\"3,21\":\"problem\",\"3,30\":\"problem\",\"3,31\":\"problem\",\"3,32\":\"problem\",\"3,33\":\"problem\",\"3,39\":\"problem\",\"3,40\":\"problem\",\"3,47\":\"test\",\"3,49\":\"problem\",\"3,52\":\"problem\",\"3,53\":\"problem\",\"3,59\":\"problem\",\"4,3\":\"problem\",\"4,4\":\"problem\",\"4,5\":\"problem\",\"4,25\":\"test\",\"4,29\":\"problem\",\"4,32\":\"problem\",\"4,33\":\"problem\",\"4,34\":\"problem\",\"4,59\":\"problem\",\"4,65\":\"problem\",\"4,66\":\"problem\",\"4,83\":\"test\",\"4,99\":\"problem\",\"4,114\":\"problem\",\"4,115\":\"problem\",\"4,127\":\"problem\",\"4,146\":\"problem\",\"4,148\":\"problem\",\"5,8\":\"problem\",\"5,9\":\"problem\",\"5,24\":\"problem\",\"5,27\":\"problem\",\"5,28\":\"problem\",\"5,29\":\"problem\",\"5,31\":\"problem\",\"5,47\":\"problem\",\"5,48\":\"problem\",\"5,50\":\"problem\",\"5,58\":\"problem\",\"5,59\":\"problem\",\"5,64\":\"test\",\"5,65\":\"test\",\"5,76\":\"problem\",\"5,78\":\"problem\",\"5,101\":\"problem\",\"5,106\":\"problem\",\"5,108\":\"problem\",\"5,109\":\"problem\",\"5,119\":\"problem\",\"5,140\":\"problem\",\"5,165\":\"problem\",\"6,0\":\"problem\",\"6,1\":\"problem\",\"6,5\":\"problem\",\"6,8\":\"problem\",\"6,10\":\"problem\",\"6,14\":\"problem\",\"6,15\":\"problem\",\"6,19\":\"problem\",\"6,20\":\"problem\",\"6,23\":\"problem\",\"6,34\":\"problem\",\"6,35\":\"problem\",\"6,38\":\"problem\",\"6,39\":\"problem\",\"6,44\":\"problem\",\"6,45\":\"problem\",\"6,46\":\"problem\",\"6,47\":\"problem\",\"6,51\":\"problem\",\"6,52\":\"problem\",\"6,62\":\"problem\",\"6,63\":\"problem\",\"6,72\":\"problem\",\"6,73\":\"problem\",\"6,75\":\"problem\",\"6,80\":\"problem\",\"6,81\":\"problem\",\"6,93\":\"treatment\",\"6,94\":\"treatment\",\"6,102\":\"problem\",\"6,103\":\"problem\",\"6,115\":\"problem\",\"6,116\":\"problem\",\"6,121\":\"problem\",\"6,122\":\"problem\",\"6,124\":\"problem\",\"7,19\":\"problem\",\"7,20\":\"problem\",\"7,22\":\"problem\",\"7,29\":\"treatment\",\"7,30\":\"treatment\",\"7,33\":\"treatment\",\"7,34\":\"treatment\",\"7,35\":\"treatment\",\"7,37\":\"treatment\",\"7,38\":\"treatment\",\"7,39\":\"treatment\",\"7,45\":\"problem\",\"7,50\":\"problem\",\"7,64\":\"problem\",\"7,65\":\"problem\",\"7,77\":\"problem\",\"7,82\":\"problem\",\"7,88\":\"treatment\",\"7,89\":\"treatment\",\"8,16\":\"problem\",\"8,17\":\"problem\",\"8,22\":\"problem\",\"8,25\":\"problem\",\"8,26\":\"problem\",\"8,34\":\"problem\",\"8,40\":\"treatment\",\"8,46\":\"treatment\",\"8,47\":\"treatment\",\"8,57\":\"treatment\",\"8,58\":\"treatment\",\"8,59\":\"treatment\",\"8,60\":\"treatment\",\"8,89\":\"treatment\",\"8,90\":\"treatment\",\"8,99\":\"treatment\",\"8,100\":\"treatment\",\"8,101\":\"treatment\",\"8,102\":\"treatment\",\"8,103\":\"treatment\",\"8,108\":\"treatment\",\"8,130\":\"treatment\",\"8,131\":\"treatment\",\"8,134\":\"problem\",\"8,135\":\"problem\",\"8,136\":\"problem\",\"8,140\":\"treatment\",\"8,142\":\"treatment\",\"8,148\":\"treatment\",\"8,155\":\"treatment\",\"8,157\":\"treatment\",\"8,161\":\"treatment\",\"8,174\":\"problem\",\"9,0\":\"treatment\",\"9,1\":\"treatment\",\"9,5\":\"treatment\",\"9,8\":\"treatment\",\"9,17\":\"problem\",\"9,18\":\"problem\",\"9,30\":\"treatment\",\"9,45\":\"treatment\",\"9,50\":\"problem\",\"9,51\":\"problem\",\"10,6\":\"treatment\",\"10,7\":\"treatment\",\"10,8\":\"treatment\",\"10,16\":\"treatment\",\"10,17\":\"treatment\",\"10,20\":\"treatment\",\"10,21\":\"treatment\",\"10,22\":\"treatment\",\"10,29\":\"treatment\",\"10,34\":\"problem\",\"10,35\":\"problem\",\"10,36\":\"problem\",\"10,44\":\"problem\",\"10,45\":\"problem\",\"10,51\":\"problem\",\"10,57\":\"problem\",\"10,58\":\"problem\",\"10,59\":\"problem\",\"10,61\":\"problem\",\"10,62\":\"problem\",\"10,76\":\"problem\",\"10,77\":\"problem\",\"10,88\":\"problem\",\"10,93\":\"treatment\",\"10,94\":\"treatment\",\"10,98\":\"problem\",\"10,99\":\"problem\",\"10,102\":\"problem\"

disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020 [1]. Preliminary data suggests that obesity may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19 [2]. Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) [3], formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may translate to a greater risk from respiratory diseases [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. It is currently not known whether MALFD patients are also more likely to have greater COVID-19 severity of illness. This study investigated the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity.\",\"We consecutively enrolled 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China (the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou Central Hospital, and Ruian People's Hospital) between January 1, 2020 and February 29, 2020. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria [3]. Sixty six COVID-19 patients with MAFLD were included in the analyses and were divided into two groups [those with obesity (n = 45) and those without (n = 21)]. All patients received standard treatment based on the COVID-19 Management Guidance (7th edition) [8]. This study was approved by the local ethics review boards of all three hospitals. The requirement for written informed consent was waived for use of the de-identified data.\",\"COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the management guideline [8]. Blood routine markers were analyzed at the central laboratory of respective hospital using standard methods by VITROS 5600 Integrated Immunodiagnostic System (VITROS 5600, Johnson, New Jersey, USA).\",\"We collected demographic information and past medical history from all patients. Laboratory parameters were tested on the first day of hospital admission. Body weight and height were measured by trained examiners on admission. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Obesity was defined as BMI >25 kg/m2 [9]. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were diagnosed based on established criteria [10]. All patients denied a history of chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.\",\"Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD and compared using either the Student's t-test for normally distributed variables or the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences between categorical variables was examined with the chi-squared test or the Fisher's exact test as appropriate. The association between obesity (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) among MAFLD patients was assessed by binary logistic regression. Statistical analyses were two-sided and significance was set at p < .05. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).\",\"The mean age of enrolled patients was 47 years and 74.2% were female. Table 1\\nshows the main clinical and biochemical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with MAFLD stratified by obesity status. Mean BMI for the non-obese and obese patients were 22.7 ± 2.1 kg/m2 and 28.3 ± 3.2 kg/m2, respectively. Compared with the non-obese group, obese patients had higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, fasting blood glucose and LDL-cholesterol, and lower lymphocyte counts. Notably, MALFD patients that were obese had more severe COVID-19 disease (37.5% vs. 9.5%, p = .021).\",\"As shown in Supplementary Table, there were 47 (71.2%) patients with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 (28.8%) with severe COVID-19. Compared to those with non-severe COVID-19, patients with severe disease were more obese (89.5% vs. 59.6%, p = .021). They were also more likely to be smokers (26.3% vs. 6.4%, p = .038), and had higher C-reactive protein concentrations (median 52.7 [IQR 33.5–74.9] vs. 18.3 [4.6–24.9], p < .001) and lower lymphocyte counts (median 1.0 [IQR 0.8–1.2] vs. 1.4 [1.1–1.7], p = .005).\",\"As shown in Table 2\\n, in the unadjusted logistic regression model with COVID-19 severity as the outcome, the presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~ 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19–27.91, p = .029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95%CI 1.16–34.54, p = .033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.\",\"Our results show that in MAFLD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the presence of obesity markedly increases the risk of having severe illness. This association remained significant after adjusting for likely confounders.\",\"We reported previously that obesity is associated with a nearly 3-fold increased risk for severe COVID-19 with a dose-effect relationship between increasing BMI and the proportion of patients with severe illness [11]. In the current analysis, the risk of severe illness in MAFLD patients with co-existing obesity was >6-fold greater after adjustment for confounders. These findings are distinct, suggesting that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is significantly greater in those with MAFLD. However, the virological and physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship we observed is not clarified by the present data. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, a common complication in severe COVID-19 [12], is promoted by the activation of CD14+ and CD16+ inflammatory monocytes producing a larger amount of interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. This suggests IL-6 is a key proinflammatory factor that triggers the inflammatory “storm” in patients [13]. In MAFLD patients, particularly those with obesity, increased inflammatory activity in the liver and visceral fat is independently correlated with increased levels of IL-6 [14], which might have an additive/synergistic role in promoting greater severity of COVID-19. It is conceivable that the secretion of hepatokines for example, reduced adiponectin or the altered secretion of inflammatory lipid mediators in obese patients with MAFLD [15], may also contribute to the current observations.\",\"While this is the first multi-center study to investigate obesity as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness in patients with MAFLD, some limitations should be recognized. Patients included in our study did not undergo liver biopsy, thus COVID-19 severity in relation to liver histology could not be assessed. Waist circumference, a risk factor for MAFLD, was not measured in our patients, which precluded adjustment of this confounder. In addition, patients were of Asian ethnicity and thus the applicability of the results to other ethnic groups is uncertain. Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the underlying mechanisms for why the association with obesity is greater in those with MAFLD.\",\"In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the risk of obesity to COVID-19 severity is greater in those with, than those without MAFLD.\",\"Study concept and design: Kenneth I.

A number of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality are known, including age, sex, and a number of chronic conditions and laboratory findings [ 2 ] . Recently, a study on COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China discovered associations between ABO blood types and infection [ 3 ] . Their analysis compared blood groups between hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the general populations of Wuhan and Shenzhen City, as assessed by previously-published samples of healthy individuals. They found that the odds of testing positive for COVID-19 among A blood groups was increased and among O blood groups was decreased relative to the general population. Similarly, previous work has identified associations between ABO blood groups and a number of different infections or disease severity following infections, including SARS-CoV- 1 [ 4 ] , P. falciparum [ 5 ] , H. pylori [ 6 ] , Norwalk virus [ 7 ], hepatitis B virus [ 8 ] , and N. gonorrhoeae [ 9 ] .\",\"Within the United States, New York City has become a major center of the pandemic, with over 64,000 cases and over 2,400 deaths as of April 5, 2020 [ 10 ] . We sought to replicate and extend the previous investigation into the association between COVID-19 and blood type using electronic health record data from New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) hospital in New York, USA. We compared both ABO and ABO+Rh blood types, and we investigated three COVID-19 outcomes: infection status, intubation, and death. We performed a multivariate analysis of our results to evaluate potential confounding due to risk factors, and we meta-analyzed our results in combination with data from China. This study is approved by the IRB (#AAAL0601).\",\"Throughout our analysis, individuals with a single positive SARS-CoV-2 lab test are considered COV+, even if they had previous or subsequent negative tests. Blood group was identified using either a measurement of LOINC code 34474-7, \\\"ABO and Rh group [Type] in Cord blood,\\\" or the results of a procedure identified by one of the names listed in Table 4 . We excluded individuals with multiple contradictory blood group measurements.\",\"We compared blood groups (defined both as ABO and ABO+Rh) and COVID-19 outcomes using four pairs of populations: COV+ vs COV-, COV+ vs general population (excluding those tested for COVID-19), COV+/Intubated vs COV+/Not intubated, and COV+/Deceased vs COV+/Alive. For each of the eight test conditions (2 blood group definitions and 4 outcome comparison population pairs), we performed a Pearson's Chi-squared test to test whether blood group distributions differ between the compared populations. Additionally, we compared each blood group against all others using a 2x2 contingency table to determine effect sizes for each blood group itself. For the one-vs-rest blood group comparisons, we report odds ratios (OR), p-values from Fisher's exact test (two-sided), and odds ratio confidence intervals.\",\"We evaluated the confounding effect of risk factors (age, sex, overweight status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, and cardiovascular diseases) on associations between blood group and COVID-19 outcomes. Since these analyses were performed at the individual level, we only considered COV+ vs COV-, COV+/Intubated vs COV+/Not intubated, and COV+/Died vs COV+/Alive, leaving out the COV+ vs general population comparison. Risk factor phenotypes were assigned using diagnosis codes (Table 5 ) .\",\"First, we evaluated associations between risk factors and blood groups using logistic regressions of risk factors on blood groups. Second, we verified that risk factors are collectively predictive of COVID-19 outcomes by comparing the fit of a logistic regression model using risk factors to a null model, using only an intercept term. Third, we tested whether blood groups provide additional information on outcomes beyond risk factors by comparing the deviances of a full model (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to a nested model using only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors). Fourth, we tested whether the effects of blood groups are modulated by risk factors by comparing logistic regression coefficients for blood groups between nested (outcome ~ blood group) and full (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) logistic regression models. In this comparison, the magnitude of blood group coefficients going to zero when risk factors are added would be evidence that outcome is conditionally independent of blood group given risk factors.\",\"We performed a meta-analysis using our data in combination with data from Wuhan and Shenzhen reported by Zhao et al. [ 3 ] . These analyses used a random effects model to create pooled estimates of odds ratios for each ABO blood group in comparisons between COV+ individuals and the general populations of New York, Wuhan, and Shenzhen. The distribution of blood groups in the general population was estimated using blood group lab results on 108,860 individuals recorded in the NYP/CUIMC electronic health record (EHR) system between May 2011 and June 2019, excluding results for any individuals later tested for COVID-19 (regardless of result). We then compared the general population blood group distributions between New York and Wuhan and Shenzhen and evaluated the heterogeneity between sites.\",\"We considered EHR data up to April 5, 2020. We conducted our analyses using the R language, using the meta package [ 11 ] for meta-analysis. While our data from NYP/CUIMC are protected by HIPAA and cannot be released, we have made all code used for our analysis available at https://github.com/zietzm/abo_covid_analysis . The manuscript was written openly on GitHub using Manubot [ 12 ] .\",\"We first determined blood groups for SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals using laboratory measurements recorded in the NYP/CUIMC EHR system. One individual with multiple contradictory blood group measurements was excluded, resulting in 1,559 individuals with known blood groups who received a SARS-CoV-2 test (either positive or negative result). Of these, 682 were COV+ (positive in at least one SARS-CoV-2 test) and 877 were COV-(negative in all SARS-CoV-2 tests administered). Among the COV+ individuals, 179 were intubated and 80 had died, while the remaining individuals had not been intubated and were alive as of April 5, 2020. We found that 354 tested COV-individuals were intubated during the same time, though we did not include them in any analysis. Table 1 gives a summary of the cohort we considered. * AB-negative was not included in the ABO+Rh analyses as no individuals with that blood type recorded tested positive for COVID-19.\",\"For each comparison cohort pair, we performed chi-squared tests using both ABO and ABO+Rh blood types (Table 6 ).

Blood groups A were associated with increased odds of testing positive for COVID-19 (OR 1.338, 95% CI [1.072-1.672], p=0.009), while O blood groups were associated with decreased odds of testing positive (OR 0.804, 95% CI [0.654-0.987], p=0.036). While few individuals with AB blood groups were included (21 COV+, 47 COV-), we also found AB blood groups to be associated with decreased odds of testing positive (OR 0.561, 95% CI [0.315-0.969], p=0.033). When we tested individual ABO+Rh blood groups against all others, we discovered that strong associations are only found in Rh positive blood groups (Tables 2 , 7 ). We did not find any significant associations between blood group and intubation or death. Finally, we compared the blood group distributions between all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the general population at NYP/CUIMC, finding insufficient evidence to conclude that tested individuals are not drawn from the general population at random (p=0.2736). \",\"We find that the significant associations we report cannot be explained by known risk factors. We considered age, sex, overweight status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. First, we found significant associations between blood groups and risk factors. Using blood group ~ risk factors logistic regressions for each blood group, we found significant associations between hypertension and O-blood groups, between age and A, A+, AB, AB+, O, and O+ blood groups, between diabetes mellitus and B and A-blood groups, as well as between overweight status and O+ blood groups (Table 8 ) .\",\"We found that blood groups provide significant additional information on outcomes beyond risk factors. First, we verified that the risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors) provide predictive power compared to intercept-only null models (Table 9 ). Then, we evaluated blood group's effect on COVID-19 outcomes beyond risk factors using analysis of deviance. Specifically, we compared models including both risk factors and blood group (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) to those including only risk factors (outcome ~ risk factors), and we found that only the COVID-19 test result outcome (COV+ vs COV-) is significantly better explained by including blood group in addition to risk factors (p<0.02 for both ABO and ABO+Rh, Table 9 ). This result is consistent with our univariate analysis (Table 6 ) , where only COV+ vs COV-cohorts showed significant differences in blood group distribution.\",\"Finally, we showed that blood group's effects are not modulated by risk factors. To do so, we inspected individual blood group coefficients between nested (outcome ~ blood group) and full (outcome ~ blood group + risk factors) logistic regression models. For ABO blood groups, we found no large coefficient changes, with some coefficients even being more extreme (greater in magnitude and more significant) in full models than in nested models (Table 10 ) . No ABO+Rh blood groups were significant in either the nested or full models for ABO+Rh, though we found no large coefficient changes for these blood groups either. We find little evidence for conditional independence between outcomes and blood groups given risk factors.\",\"Finally, we compared our data from New York City to the data from Wuhan and Shenzhen presented by Zhao et al.\",\"[ 3 ] and conducted a meta-analysis. Zhao et al. used a random effects model to weight and pool effects between three different hospitals (Wuhan Jinyintan, Renmin Hospital in Wuhan, and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital), comparing each hospital's COV+ blood group distribution to the general population distribution for each city. We performed a similar analysis-including NYP/CUIMC data-to assess the effect of blood type in the combined data from all four sources (full counts in Table 3 ).\",\"We fit a random effects model for each ABO blood type using data from NYP/CUIMC and the three sources for which Zhao et al. report data.

Using the additional data from NYP/CUIMC, the pooled association between blood group B becomes larger in effect size and significant at the 5% level (original: OR 1.09, p=0.121; with NYP/CUIMC data: OR 1.25, p=0.0361). \",\"Finally, we found significant heterogeneity among the sites we considered in the meta-analysis. We found that the distribution of blood groups in the general population at NYP/CUIMC differs significantly from both the distributions in Shenzhen (Chi-squared = 2056, p-value < 2.2e-16) and Wuhan (Chi-squared = 583.29, p-value < 2.2e-16) ( Table 3 ) . The difference in distributions is reflected in tests of heterogeneity between sites, where we find more heterogeneity between sites in our meta-analysis than Zhao et al.'s meta-analysis (Table 12 ).\",\"We found consistent negative associations between O blood groups and COVID-19. These results are consistent with an association discovered for SARS-CoV-1 [ 4 ], in which O blood groups were significantly less common among SARS patients.\",\". CC-BY 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\",\"is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .\",\"Our results from NYP/CUIMC identified significant associations between A, AB, and O blood groups. However, further stratifying by Rh resulted in significant associations for A+ and O+ only. Negative Rh blood groups are less common in our data, representing only 9.25% of individuals, so the lack of evidence for association with negative blood types could be due to lower sample sizes. Yet, odds ratios for ABO groups A and O are less extreme than the associated ABO+Rh blood groups (A+, O+), and the corresponding negative blood groups (A-, O-) have (insignificant) odds in the opposite directions as their positive counterparts. Further work is needed to better understand the associations between Rh negative blood groups and COVID-19.\",\"Since both blood groups and risk factors vary across populations, we thought it was important to evaluate the associations we found in a multivariate context as well. Indeed, we found significant associations between risk factors and blood groups. However, the significant associations between blood group and COVID-19 status were reflected in significant reductions in deviance when adding blood group to a regression of risk factors on COVID-19 status. Moreover, the blood group regression coefficients were largely unchanged when risk factors were present or not, indicating that blood groups have an independent effect on COVID-19 status not captured by the risk factors. These results suggest that the significant associations we discovered are not explained by confounding due to these risk factors.\",\"Our meta-analysis found large heterogeneity in blood group distributions between Wuhan, Shenzhen, and New York City, consistent with previous work indicating large differences in blood group distributions between the United States and China [ 13 , 14 ] . Overall blood group differences introduced heterogeneity in our meta-analysis comparisons of blood group between COV+ individuals and the general population. However, the increased sample size afforded by adding NYP/CUIMC data allowed the B blood group association to be declared significant at the 5% level. Larger sample sizes of COVID-19 patients will allow afford a more detailed picture of the effects of blood type on COVID-19 susceptibility.\",\"The significant associations we found for blood type between COV+ and COV-individuals were far from significant in a comparison between COV+ and the general population at NYP/CUIMC. A possible explanation for this finding is that individuals tested for infection at NYP/CUIMC represent a more homogeneous sub-population of patients at NYP/CUIMC. Increased homogeneity would strengthen the blood-group-COVID-19 association signal as it would reduce the influence of overall population differences in blood-type distribution. We did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that SARS-CoV-2-tested individuals have a significantly different blood group distribution than the general population at NYP/CUIMC, though we cannot rule out other differences between tested and general populations that could explain the difference in associations. Moreover, our meta-analysis using COV+ vs general population found significant associations between A, B, and O blood groups, and the NYP/CUIMC data received 20-30 percent weight for each comparison, indicating a large contribution to the pooled associations. Further work is needed to understand how the population of COVID-tested patients differs from the general population.\",\"We did not identify any significant relationships between blood group and intubation or death due to COVID-19.

Our data is preliminary and represents a snapshot of the pandemic in a New York hospital system. When more patients become tested, intubated, and recovered, we will be better able to assess the relationship between blood group and eventual COVID-19 outcomes that may not have occurred at the time of our analysis.\",\"Our study analyzed EHR data collected during the care of patients, not necessarily with research intent. Our sample sizes were relatively small, making explicit stratifications by age, sex, comorbidities, and other risk factors challenging. As an observational study without rigorous corrections for additional possible confounding, our results should be considered preliminary and should not be taken to inform clinical practice or policy.\",\"In this study we found evidence for association between blood groups and COVID-19. Using data from NYP/CUIMC, we found the odds of COVID-19 positive vs negative test results were increased in blood groups A and decreased in blood groups O, consistent with previous results from Wuhan and Shenzhen. While Rh negative blood types are rare, we find evidence of association only for Rh positive blood groups. Though few AB individuals were included in our cohort, we discovered a new significant odds decrease for AB blood groups. In a meta-analysis of our data with data from Wuhan and Shenzhen reported by Zhao et al., we found a new significant COVID-19 odds increase for B blood groups compared to the general population. We demonstrated that the associations we found were not explained by confounding due to several known risk factors. Our results replicate previously-discovered associations between A and O blood groups and COVID-19, and we show novel associations between B, AB, and Rh blood groups. .

December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia have attacked all human beings.1 The pathogen was designated as SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and this pneumonia was named as Coronavirus Disease2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO).2 Nowadays, there were more than one million confirmed cases and over 100000 deaths occurred in 208 countries/territories according to the report of WHO until April 12th, 2020. The rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. Lai et al.3 found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. However, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (ICU) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients. Clinical workers should pay attention to the risk factors of COVID-19 critical disease and death, identify critical patients early, allocate medical resources rationally and timely adjust the treatment plan to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death. In this article, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with critical/mortal illness and non-critical illness in 13 literatures with 3027 patients, to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 patients to develop critical disease or death, in order to effectively predict the progression of the disease, make early treatment response and allocate medical resources in a better way.\",\"This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)Statement.\",\"We selected relevant studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 20, 2020, by searching Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI. We applied no language restrictions. The search terms and relative variants were as follows: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR Wuhan coronavirus OR Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus OR COVID-19 OR COVID19 OR coronavirus disease 2019 virus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS2 OR 2019-nCoV OR 2019 novel coronavirus AND Mortalities OR Mortality OR Fatality OR Death OR acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) OR ICU. We also reviewed the references of included articles to guarantee the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our research.\",\"The inclusion criterions for the 13 articles are as follows: (1) groups involving critical illness or death and non-critical illness;(2) patients should be confirmed to have been infected by 2019 novel coronavirus; (3) study designs included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, case‐control studies, cohort studies, cross‐sectional studies, and also case reports;(3) at least one outcome reported among demographical characteristics, comorbidities and clinical manifestations; (4) study sample was larger than 20. We excluded duplicate reports, abstracts from conferences and commentary articles.\",\"Data extraction and the evaluation of literature quality were conducted independently by 2 investigators (Z.Z.H&T.W.L). Microsoft Excel database was used to record all available information, including baseline details, comorbidities, clinical manifestations. Any disagreement was resolved by another investigator (P.F). The MINORS4 was used to assess bias risk.\",\"All analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel, State software version 15.0 and RevMan software version 5.3. The results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models (Mantel–Haenszel method) or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between studies. We used the I2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity: 25%, 50%, and 75% represented low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. The chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results: the fixed effect model was used if I2 ≤ 50% and the random effect model was used if I2>50%. If there was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.\",\"Based on the previous search strategy, 523 studies were searched from the online database. After deleting duplicate records, a total of 343 records were retained. Then, 311 articles were excluded by the titles and abstracts, and 19 of the remaining 32 articles were deleted for various reasons. The last 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Finally, a total of 13 studies with 3027 patients were included5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17\\n(\\nFigure 1\\n).All of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 27 to 1099 patients. Clinical outcome was defined as ICU admission in 3 studies,6\\n,\\n8\\n,\\n12 refractory in 1 study,7 severity in 2 studies,9\\n,\\n11 Sp02 < 90%in 1 study,13 onset of ARDS in 1 study14 and death in the remaining investigation.5\\n,\\n10\\n,\\n15, 16, 17 The risk of bias and applicability concerns included studies are showed in Table 1\\n. Over all, none of the studies was considered to be seriously flawed according to the MINORS assessment. The 13 included studies scored between 18 and 21. All studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for selection.\",\"The demographical characteristics of the included studies are shown in Table 2\\n. The results from the 13 included studies (with a total amount of 3027 patients) showed that the proportion of male was significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group [male: OR = 1.77, 95% CI (1.43, 2.19), P < 0.00001] (Figure 2\\n).\",\"The median ages ranged from 49 to 70.5 years old in the critical/mortal group across the enrolled studies. The median ages ranged from 37 to 62 years old in the non-critical group (Table1). The median ages were generally higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group. Furthermore, age over 65 years was analyzed as a subgroup by Guan8 and Tian11 (with a total amount of 1273 patients). Meta-analysis showed that the proportion of patients older than 65 years was higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group. [age over 65 years old: OR = 6.01, 95% CI (3.95, 9.16), P < 0.00001] (Figure 2).\",\"Five studies showed that the proportion of current smoker was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [current smoking: OR = 2.04, 95% CI (1.32, 3.15), P = 0.0006] (Figure 2).\",\"There was no heterogeneity in the estimates of male, age over 65 years old and current smoking among the identified studies with I2 = 0.\",\"The comorbidities of patients of the included studies are shown in Table 3\\n. We then compared the difference of the prevalence of the comorbidities between critical/mortal patients and non-critical patients. For diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as I2 = 45%, 37% and 50%. Thus, the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses. The proportion of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [diabetes:0R = 3.68, 95% CI (2.68, 5.03), P < 0.00001;cardiovascular disease: OR = 5.19, 95% CI (3.25, 8.29), P < 0.00001; respiratory disease: OR = 5.15, 95% CI (2.51, 10.57), P < 0.00001](Figure 3\\n). For hypertension, the heterogeneity test showed that I2 = 72%. Given that the severity of illness and severity of epidemic might contribute to the heterogeneity, we classified the studies into two subgroups according to whether the study site was located in Wuhan. However, heterogeneity still exists. So the random effect model was used. The result indicated a higher proportion of hypertension in critical/mortal group[OR = 2.72, 95% CI (1.60,4.64), P = 0.0002] (Figure 3).For malignancy, the fixed-effect model(I2 = 0) meta-analysis showed that the proportion of malignancy was higher in critical/death group yet without statistical significance[OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.81, 3.18), P = 0.18] (Figure 3).\",\"The study of clinical manifestation included 13 studies, a total of 3025 cases. The clinical features are showed in Table 4\\nand the results of meta-analysis are showed in Table 5\\n. For fever (temperature ≥ 37.3°C), the proportion of fever was statistically lower in critical/mortal group [0R = 0.56, 95% CI (0.38, 0.82), P = 0.003]. The proportion of headache and myalgia/arthralgia were lower in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [headache: OR = 0.82, 95% CI (0.50, 1.36), P = 0.45; myalgia/arthralgia: OR = 0.77, 95% CI (0.58, 1.04), P = 0.09] but there was no statistical significance. For cough, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea and nausea/ vomiting, the proportion of them was higher in critical/mortal patients[cough: OR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.85,1.38), P = 0.52; sputum production: OR = 1.14, 95% CI (0.84, 1.54), P = 0.39; fatigue: OR = 1.13, 95% CI (0.88, 1.44), P = 0.34;diarrhea: OR = 1.41, 95% CI (0.82, 2.43), P = 0.22;nausea/ vomiting: OR = 1.32, 95% CI (0.72, 2.42), P = 0.37], however, without statistical significance. For shortness of breath/ dyspnea, the proportion of this clinical manifestation was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group[0R = 4.16, 95% CI (3.13, 5.53), P < 0.00001].\",\"The laboratory examination of the included studies (4 studies, a total of 1286 cases) are shown in Table 6\\n. For “WBC < 4 × 109per L”, the analysis results of the fixed effect-model (I2 = 0)showed that the proportion of “WBC < 4 × 109per L” was statistically lower in critical/mortal group[0R = 0.30, 95% CI (0.17, 0.51), P < 0.00001] (Figure 4\\n). For “AST > 40U/L”, “Cr ≥ 133μmol/L” and “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL”, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as I2 = 0%, 0% and 34%. We used the fixed-effect model for further analyses. The proportion of “AST > 40U/L”, “Cr ≥ 133μmol/L” and “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL” was statistically significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group [“AST > 40U/L”:0R = 4.00, 95% CI (2.46, 6.52), P < 0.00001;“Cr ≥ 133μmol/L”:0R = 5.30, 95% CI (2.19, 12.83), P = 0.0002; “hs-cTnI > 28 pg/mL”:0R = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001] (Figure 5).The I2 value of “PCT > 0.5 ng/mL”, “LDH > 245U/L” and “D-dimer > 0.5mg/L” was, respectively, 52%, 59% and 72%. So the random effect model was used. The results indicated a higher proportion of “PCT > 0.5 ng/mL”, “LDH > 245U/L” and “D-dimer > 0.5mg/L” in critical/mortal patients with statistical significance [“PCT > 0.5 ng/mL”: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P< 0.00001; “LDH > 245U/L”:OR=43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001;“D-dimer0.5mg/L”: OR = 43.24, 95% CI (9.92, 188.49), P < 0.00001] (Figure 5).\",\"The results of meta-analysis showed that male, aged over 65 and smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. We found that patients with shortness of breath/dyspnea were more likely to develop into critical illness or even die, but patients with fever progressed better than those without fever. Laboratory examinations such as WBC, AST, Cr, hs-cTnI, PCT, LDH and D-dimer could imply the progression of COVID-19.\",\"Coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus.18 At present, six human coronaviruses have been identified. And the SARS-CoV-2, which isolated from the lower respiratory tract of pneumonia patients with unknown causes in Wuhan, is identified as the seventh human coronaviruses.19 SARS-CoV-2 attacks the alveolar epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the ACE of isozyme, mainly distributed in cardiovascular, kidneys, testes, lung and colon, and other organizations.20 The main role of ACE2 is to incise Ang II to generate Ang 1-7, which mediates the protective effects of vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation, to antagonize Ang II-induced vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, fibrosis promotion and vascular inflammation.21, 22, 23 When SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells, The expression of ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells is down-regulated by mechanisms such as internalization, shedding and viral replication.24 Then the increased concentration of Ang II leads to inflammatory response, and exudation of neutrophils, macrophages and fibrinous, resulting in loss of pulmonary ventilation function and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation.25 At the same time, viral infection will cause the imbalance of T helper-1 and T helper-2 responses, and induce an inflammatory storm by increasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6.26 Inflammatory storm in critical patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune injury, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death.27\\n\",\"Studies have found that women are less susceptible to viral infection than men, possibly because of the protection of X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity.28 At the same time, men tend to be associated with bad lifestyle habits such as smoking and underlying diseases. As a result, the majority of critical or mortal patients are male. As the body's immunity declines with age, elderly patients are more likely to develop critical illness or even die. Therefore, when the patient is male, over 65 years old and smoking, the patient has a higher risk of developing critical illness or death.\",\"When patients are combined with basic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, the body is in a state of stress for a long time and the immunity tends to be low. Moreover, the long-term history of diabetes and hypertension will damage the vascular structure, and it is more likely to develop into critical disease in infection. Patients with chronic heart disease are more likely to be infected due to their weakened heart function and low immunity. When infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are more likely to have acute cardiovascular events and develop into severe diseases. When the patient has previous respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient's lung function is damaged. They have lower resistance to the virus and are prone to developing ARDS. Thus, underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease are risk factors for disease progression. This is consistent with the analytical results in this paper.\",\"The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients are fever, cough and sputum.6 When the patient's immune response is low, it may manifest as normal body temperature. Shortness of breath or dyspnea suggests poor lung function and lacking of oxygen. Therefore, when the patient is found to have difficulty in breathing or no fever, it is necessary to be alert for further deterioration of the patient's condition.\",\"Viral infection will cause inflammation in human body. Various inflammatory factors produced by the inflammatory storm can cause systemic immune damage and even cause multi-organ failure. When the patient's laboratory indicator shows PCT > 0.5 ng/mL, there is a higher risk of progression to critical illness. Study showed that the total number of WBC in the early stage of the disease is normal or reduced.6 However, WBC < 4 × 109/L means a better clinical outcome in this paper. Therefore, when the total number of WBC is found to be higher than the previous one, the patient may be associated with other infections that aggravated the disease. At this moment, the clinicians might pay more attentions to these patients and improve treatment. When AST > 40U/L, LDH > 245U/L and Cr ≥ 133 mol/L, it indicates that the liver and kidney dysfunctions have been involved, and corresponding treatments should be taken in time to prevent further deterioration of the disease. Current studies have shown that up to 20% of covid-19 patients have abnormal coagulation function.6 Monocytes and tissue cells are activated after injury, causing the release of cytokines and the expression of tissue factors, and finally causing the hypercoagulability of blood. It will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera, which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death. When the D-dimer > 0.5mg/L, it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct and/or indirect action. The direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ACE2 receptor, while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response and/or oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome. When hs-cTnI > 28pg/mL, it strongly suggests the possibility of further deterioration of the patient's condition.\",\"The quality of the literature included in this study is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible. However, this meta‐analysis also has some limitations: (a) most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional studies with insufficient demonstration ability. (b) most of the patients in our meta-analysis were Chinese, and our aim was to use the findings of this study to predict the overall profile of patients, including other countries and races; (c) more detailed patient information, such as iconograph and oxygen at ion index, was not available in most studies at the time of analysis. The conclusions of this meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.\",\"This study analyzed the risk factors for progression to critical illness or death in COVID-19 patients to help assessing patient status and identify critical patients early.

isolated and sequenced, and COVID-19 was reported a public health emergency by the World health Organization (WHO). 2 Since then, COVID-19 has spread rapidly around the world with confirmed person to person transmission, an estimated R 0 between 1.4-6.47, and a doubling time of 1.8 days. 3 As of April 14, 2020, the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center has reported over 2 million confirmed global cases and over 0.6 million cases in the United States. Developing new therapies, identifying risk factors, and minimizing spread through social distancing remain top priorities in the fight against COVID-19. 4, 5 Previous studies have examined the effects of various risk factors on spread of COVID-19 including patient demographics, 6,7 social determinants of health, 8 environmental variables, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] housing, 16, 17 and underlying health conditions.

Ultimately, this may help \\\"flatten the curve\\\" of cases and avoid overwhelming the health care system. However, prior analyses of these risk factors have not robustly accounted for potential confounding effects.\",\"In this study, we analyze data for COVID-19 in United States counties and ground them in the larger context of patient demographics, underlying health conditions, social determinants of health, environmental variables, and social distancing adherence. We illuminate various factors that affect COVID-19 cases and deaths, and reassess these variables while controlling for possible confounding variables in multivariate logistic and linear regressions.\",\"COVID-19 confirmed case number and death number through April 14, 2020 were obtained for each U.S. county from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. This data source contains COVID-19 case number and deaths data from all 3,143 U.S. counties in 50 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.). Cases per 100,000 people and deaths per 100,000 people for each U.S. county were calculated using CSSE and census data. Counties were excluded from the analyses if they had fewer than 50 cases or their first case occurred fewer than 3 weeks prior to the end of the study. With these constraints, 661 counties from 50 states and Washington D.C were included in case analysis. Counties were excluded from death analyses if they reported fewer than 10 deaths or the first death had occurred fewer than 2 weeks prior to the end of the study. The deaths analyses include 217 counties from 37 states and D.C. ( Table 1 ).\",\"Race demographics for counties was obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program database. Daily temperature data for counties was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. County temperature was calculated using mean temperature for a period starting 10 days before the first confirmed county case and through the most current date (April 14, 2020). Unacast social distancing data was obtained through a research agreement with the company. Data for other potential risk factors used in analysis was obtained through publicly available data sources. ( Table 2 ) .\",\"T-tests were used to compare differences between covariates for the highest quartile and lowest quartile cases per 100,000 and the top 50% versus the bottom 50% deaths per 100,000. Sequential regression modelling was used to demonstrate the effect of race and temperature on cases and deaths per 100,000. Logistic regression was used to compare counties in the highest quartile for cases per 100,000 to those in the lowest. There were an insufficient number of counties meeting the deaths per 100,000 requirements to run logistic regression, thus linear regression was used for deaths per 100,000 analyses. Results of linear regression for cases per 100,000 including all 661 counties are provided for direct comparison between cases and deaths.\",\"The sequential model had four parts. Each model included all variables from the previous models. Model 1 was a univariate analysis. Model 2 added the following county macroeconomic and COVID-19-specific variables: population density, GDP/capita, COVID-19 tests per 100,000 people (state level data), COVID-19 cases/100,000 people (deaths analysis only), a marker for which State the county is in, average percent reduction in cellphone movement from day of first confirmed case to end of study, the percent of population living in overcrowded housing, and the number of days since the first confirmed COVID-19 case. Model 3 added these county demographics and environmental variables to Model 2: percent of population over 65, proportion of Black residents, percent of the population that is female, percent of population living in rural areas, the Food Environment Index (a measure of accessibility and affordability of healthy food), the rate of violent crime per 100,000 people, the average temperature from 10 days before the first case to the end of the study, air quality measured as the average annual ambient concentrations of PM2.5, percent of the population considered to be in fair or poor health, and the poverty rate. Model 4 was the full model and included medical comorbidities and access to health care variables in addition to all variables in Model 3. Specifically these new variables were: diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, excessive drinking, and smoking were all reported as percent of the population; liver disease, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease were reported as mortality per 100,000 people; and the patient to primary care physician ratio, the percent of people sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, the percent of the population without health insurance and the percent of the population who received the flu vaccine were also included All statistical analyses were performed with Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For all analyses, α = 0.05.\",\"Our study contained data from 3,143 U.S. counties across all 50 states and the District of Columbia (D.C). 661 U.S. counties (21.0%) from 50 states and D.C. were included in case analysis ( Figure 1A ). 217 U.S. counties (6.9%) from 37 states and D.C. were included in death analysis ( Figure 1B ). To control for possible confounding variables, sequential multivariate regression analyses were performed. For case rate logistic regression analysis, the adverse effect of percent Black remained significant with the addition of macroeconomic and COVID-19 specific variables in logistic regression (OR=1.03, 95% CI:1.01-1.06, P =<0.0001) whereas the effect of temperature was still not significant (OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.93-1.01, P =0.19). Adding county demographics and environmental factors resulted in both percent Black (OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.08-1.24, P =<0.0001) and temperature (OR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.73-0.90, P =0.0002) demonstrating significant effects on cases per 100,000. In the final model, the adverse effect of percent Black (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P =0.001) and the protective effect of temperature (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P =0.0009) remained robust to the addition of medical comorbidities and access to health care. Similar results are seen in the linear model, although the effects of percent Black and temperature do not become significant until Model 3 (Table 4) .\",\".

Recent work has primarily focused on patient demographics, underlying health comorbidities, social disparities in healthcare access and quality, and environmental variables such as pollution to identify potential risk factors and vulnerable populations. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] However, while these previous studies have examined the effects of these domains on COVID-19 spread independently, some do not control for the potentially confounding interactions between variables. In this study, we sought to investigate COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in all U.S. counties through a more comprehensive framework that accounts for effects of county-level macroeconomic, demographic, environmental, health status, and healthcare access variables. By conducting sequential multivariate analyses of variables that span social, structural, and environmental spheres, our study aims to more completely characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby identify particularly salient risk factors and vulnerable populations in the United States.\",\"In recent weeks, numerous headlines and research studies have brought race to the forefront as a potentially significant risk factor for increased COVID- 19 .

[18] [19] [20] Studies have also cited the many inequities in structural variables, which now manifest in the disproportionate number of Black Americans who suffer from poverty, reside in densely packed areas with more environmental hazards, have decreased access to healthy food sources, and lack healthcare coverage and access. 31 In our comprehensive multivariate analysis, we were able to control for these potentially confounding variables; however, after doing so, our data continue to demonstrate a disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in counties with large Black populations in the United States.\",\"This increased disease burden did not seem to be explained by previously proposed mechanisms, indicating that other modulating factors should be considered and novel interventions designed appropriately. One potential domain includes additional sociocultural variables that have only now become relevant within the context of the pandemic. For example, African Americans make up a large percentage of the healthcare, transportation, government, and food supply industries, job sectors that have now been deemed \\\"essential\\\" services in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 34 Despite the majority of Americans currently living in counties with some form of social distancing mandate, a recent announcement by the U.S. Surgeon General indicated that fewer than one in five Black Americans have a job that gives them this flexibility to work from home, compared with more than a third of white and Asian American workers. 35 The potentially fatal consequences of this fact can already be seen in the case of the New York City transit system. The city's transit workforce, which has been among the hardest hit by the virus with more than 2,000 cases, 59 deaths, and over 4,000 employees in quarantine, is comprised mostly of ethnic and racial minorities, with African Americans accounting for nearly half of transit workers despite making up just 24% of the city's overall population. 36, 37 Furthermore, despite an 87% reduction in overall ridership since the pandemic began, the nearly one million remaining passengers-most of whom lack the luxury of social distancing due to essential employment-are predominantly low-income people of color. 38 However, this theory is complicated by the fact that Hispanic workers also makeup a disproportionate percentage of the essential workforce, yet our data do not suggest an increased burden of COVID-19 cases and mortality amongst counties with greater Hispanic populations. 35 A potential explanation may be that Black workers may be more likely than other racial and ethnic minority groups to work essential jobs that also require close proximity and frequent contact with others, such as bus drivers, postal workers, and grocery store clerks, which would convey additional risk of COVID-19 infection. 39, 40 However, more work is needed to elucidate potential mechanisms to explain the differing disease burdens between these vulnerable populations.\",\"One potential consideration is that non-Hispanic Black populations in the United States have been shown to suffer from vitamin D deficiency at rates much higher than any other ethnic or racial group, with recent data suggesting that non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations in the United States suffer from vitamin D deficiency at rates of 24 and 4 times more than those .

Several recent reports have also linked higher temperature to decreased virus spread, while others have found no significant effects. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Here, we demonstrate an independent effect of temperature that results in reduced COVID-19 cases, but not mortality, across U.S. counties. If warmer temperatures do, in fact, play a role in mitigating disease spread, it is reasonable to expect a potential seasonal trend in global cases and mortality. As temperatures begin to warm in the Northern hemisphere during the summer months, we may begin to see a decrease in disease burden; however, we should prepare to see a resurgence in COVID-19 incidence when temperatures again decrease in the fall and winter months, as has been exhibited in previous pandemics like the Spanish flu. 46 Likewise, countries in the Southern hemisphere should be prepared to experience seasonal trends in the opposite direction.\",\"The mechanism through which temperature may execute its mitigative effects remains unclear, though it has already been posited that increased vitamin D levels due to greater sun exposure may result in better immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it has been shown to do within the context of other viruses. 42, 43 Notably, when temperature is substituted out of our final model for other vitamin D proxies, such as average daily sunlight and latitude above and below 37 degrees, the results are also highly significant in the same direction. Including these variables together in the model resulted in multicollinearity, which suggests that they are most likely measuring the same effect. Thus, in this study, average temperature prior to the first reported COVID-19 case was chosen to be the vitamin D proxy because it was the continuous variable that contained the most specific and validated data at the county level.\",\"One potential clinical implication of these findings is on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine therapy in treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has shown some promise in early research. 47 Chloroquine has been shown to reduce the conversion of vitamin D from calcidiol to calcitriol, the former of which has been demonstrated to potentiate the immune system, 48 which may serve as a partial mechanism for the purported beneficial effects of chloroquine therapy on COVID-19 outcomes. Future research, both clinical and epidemiological, should focus on serum vitamin D levels directly to see if they demonstrate any significant effects on COVID-19 spread and morbidity. Such studies on the role of serum vitamin D levels on COVID-19 outcomes are already underway, including a retrospective review of patients with documented vitamin D levels at our institution as well as a prospective randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted by the University of Grenada that is investigating the role of vitamin D supplementation therapy versus placebo on outcomes in 200 COVID-19 patients. 49 Our results support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation, whether through behavioral or dietary interventions, may prove to be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in the United States. Though the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation seem to be particularly relevant for racial and ethnic minorities, they should also be considered for the entire population, as studies have found that less than 30% of U.S. adults have vitamin D levels that are considered sufficient for optimal health outcomes. 41 Though standardized data on worldwide vitamin D levels are currently lacking, existing meta-analyses suggest that vitamin D deficiency is also a rampant issue on a global scale and should be prioritized for future research in light of the current pandemic. 50 If the theorized effects of vitamin D on COVID-19 morbidity are supported by ongoing studies, vitamin D deficiency could emerge as a unifying theory for the findings herein and allow countries to mobilize resources in anticipation of seasonal trends and develop targeted interventions to mitigate risk.\",\"Other findings associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths included increased poverty, increased GDP per capita, increased pollution, and increased flu vaccination rate . Poverty and GDP are not typically thought to be positively correlated with each other, however, the correlations seen here may represent inequalities in health care versus and access to testing.For example, poverty may exacerbate case spread, while economic power increases testing rates, both of which would lead to increased cases. 47 Flu vaccination was included as a marker for access to healthcare and may be associated with greater testing rates. Additionally, flu vaccination is often mandated for healthcare workers, thus counties with higher flu vaccination rates may have more of its citizens having front line exposure to the virus. 52, 53 Decreased pollution was associated with increased COVID-19 cases, which does not align with prior findings in studies that associated increased air pollution with increased mortality. 15, 29 Our model also shows an inconclusive connection between air quality and COVID-19 deaths. However, air pollution data in this study is from 2014 and may not reflect current air pollution. Given increased social distancing, many counties with historically bad air pollution currently .

The most likely reason for this is due to the simultaneity bias of this metric. In particular, the metric used here does not differentiate between proactive counties and reactive counties. It is expected that less proactive social distancing will cause more cases and deaths (negative correlation) while higher numbers of cases and deaths induces fear, causing increased reactive social distancing (positive correlation). Since these effects work in opposite directions, this bias makes it more difficult to find an effect of social distancing. Studies that plan to model social distancing with numerous covariates should ensure their metric adequately delineates between proactive and reactive social distancing or employ an appropriate instrument to remove this simultaneity. 56 \",\"The emerging nature of Covid-19 required inclusion of only counties with sufficient data. Many counties were excluded from analysis for lack of Covid-19 cases or lack of Covid-19 deaths. This limitation is unavoidable and waiting for sufficient data may deter public health response. This study is also limited by the fact the COVID-19 pandemic is still in progress in all of the counties included here and is at different stages. Thus, the number of cases and mortality statistics for the counties provides a snapshot of the current state, but may not, and likely will not, be reflective of the ultimate case and death tolls in these counties. Moreover, most counties are still in the early stages of accumulating deaths which axiomatically lags behind the number of cases. While our results of temperature and Black race on cases per 100,000 have been consistent for a number of weeks, the number of counties with at least 10 deaths has only recently become large enough to perform similar analyses. Temperature also demonstrates this lack of simultaneity, but changes more predictably and slowly than Covid-19 cases and deaths. Additionally, since we relied heavily on publicly available and easily accessible sources to create our database, we used sources that may be outdated or otherwise inconsistent with the actual value of various statistics during the past few months. Confounding effects are also possible, given that it is impossible to fully extricate socioeconomic, demographic, and even some environmental variables from each other. The stepwise approach to regression mitigates excessive confounding risk through sensitivity analysis and signifies that the findings are not error artifacts. Ecological fallacies may be present in the model for demographic and socioeconomic variables compared to individual cases and deaths; we report as granularly as practical to account for this.\",\".

This study evaluated the independent effects of Black race and temperature on the incidence of cases and mortality of COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. In multivariate regression analyses that controlled for county demographics, socioeconomic factors, and medical comorbidities, counties with higher average daily temperatures were associated with decreased COVID-19 cases, but not deaths. Black race was significantly associated with both increased cases and increased deaths. This suggests that many of the proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19 such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity. A potential unifying theory of these results is the preponderance of vitamin D deficiency of Black citizens in comparison to other races in the U.S. However, additional study is needed to further understand these results. .

Wuhan, China in late 2019, is now rapidly spreading globally [1] .\",\"The world is expected to implement early precautionary measures to control the spread of COVID-19 through restriction of activities.\",\"Epilepsy, a disease characterized by a spontaneous recurrence of unprovoked seizures, is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions. Its prevalence rate is reported to be 0.7-1.0 % with high incidences in elderly people and children [2] ; additionally, some patients have comorbidities.\",\"Associations between epilepsy and COVID- 19 have not been reported. Here, we discuss the important considerations for epilepsy patients by reviewing known facts of COVID- 19 and suggestions from medical societies associated with epilepsy, as well as inferring from past experiences of infectious diseases.\",\"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that neurological comorbidities, including epilepsy, may be a risk factor for COVID-19, despite the lack of evidence. Presently, a medical history of epilepsy has not been reported to be a risk factor for developing COVID-19. Moreover, past experiences with infectious diseases do not suggest any associations. Considering the experience with previous infectious diseases, some societies suggest that epilepsy itself seems unlikely to represent a risk J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f factor for COVID-19. (Table 1 ) However, certain pre-existing conditions (such as smoking, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and cancer) are recognized as risk factors [3, 4] . Therefore, epilepsy patients with these comorbidities may adopt a more cautionary approach regarding COVID-19. Conversely, children infected with COVID-19, including those just with well-controlled epilepsy and no other health conditions, are generally asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms [5] .\",\"COVID-19 prevention strategies recommended by the CDC are applicable to all individuals, including those with epilepsy.\",\"Baig et al. suggested that the central nervous system could be a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 as the angiotensin-converting enzyme two receptors have been detected on the surface of glial cells and neurons [6, 7] .\",\"However, the effects of COVID-19 on epilepsy patients and the prevalence of newonset epilepsy cases remain unclear. Reported symptoms of COVID-19 are primarily associated with respiratory or gastrointestinal issues and have not been commonly related to seizures [8] . According to previous data, the rate of neurological comorbidity has not been assumed to be greater for COVID-19 than other respiratory viral infectious diseases. Conversely, epilepsy patients infected with COVID-19 or any other infectious diseases may have fever, which may possibly trigger seizures.\",\"Additionally, the association between anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and medications for COVID-19 requires consideration. Currently, no specific medications have been Certain epilepsy medications may affect the immune system, including everolimus and steroids that are used for tuberous sclerosis complex and autoimmune epilepsy, respectively. However, according to some studies, everolimus may prevent viral infections [9] . Meanwhile, the usage of corticosteroids is correlated with the risk of infectious diseases [10] . Hence, medications need to be chosen on an individual basis in clinical settings. Furthermore, some societies do not recommend changing the AEDs of patients with well-controlled seizures, as seizure exacerbations or status epilepticus may increase the risk of COVID-19 infections. It is also important in clinical settings to inform patients that they should not discontinue AEDs without the advice of a physician, even if it would affect to immune systems.\",\"Some societies suggest that COVID-19 could increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). There are some reports which indicate that infection or viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infectious disease might increase the risk of SUDEP [11, 12] . However, there are still no data on the association between COVID-19 and SUDEP.\",\"Many societies recommend that patients should avoid running out of AEDs. The state of increased or uncontrollable seizures could cause some problems. One is the effect of seizure on the patient's body condition. Mortality associated with epilepsy is higher in patients with uncontrollable seizures than in those with controllable seizures [13, 14] .\",\"Frequent seizures would cause malnutrition and the state of nutrition is associated with the immune system [15] . The second problem is that going to emergency rooms due to increased or uncontrollable seizures could expose the patient to coronavirus. Epilepsy foundation does not recommend going to emergency room unless there is an actual emergency. Finally, uncontrollable seizures, especially status epilepticus, would need sedation and ventilators. However, in clinical settings at regions with many COVID-19 patients, clinicians face the shortage of mechanical ventilators [16] . Increase in the number of patients with status epilepticus would aggravate this problem. Therefore, it is very important to maintain the control of seizures, as well as the prevention of COVID-19. However, visits to doctors and periodic filling of prescriptions account for the greater difficulty encountered by epilepsy patients in avoiding crowded situations. Previous experience with SARS evidently shows that emerging infectious diseases can potentially prevent epilepsy patients from keeping up with their routine appointments [17] . This can be mitigated through the introduction of telemedicine and purchase of prescription medications lasting a minimum of a few J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f months. Telemedicine allows consultations with doctors without exposure to crowded conditions, and thus prevents the spread of COVID-19 among patients. Hence, introduction and implementation of telemedicine should be given further consideration.\",\"Intractable epilepsy may be assessed and diagnosed by video-monitoring encephalograms and hospitalization. Elective surgical treatments for epilepsy, along with other non-urgent surgical procedures, may be postponed to prevent further spread of COVID-19 among medical staff and patients [18] . Hospitals should rather prepare for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require critical care.\",\"Epilepsy patients who require urgent interventions, along with their families and medical staff, should adhere to thorough prevention and protection protocols against COVID-19.\",\"Some patients do not have emergency but progressive conditions of epilepsy. As for these cases, the real risk of proceeding and the real risk of delay on intervention should be considered case by case.\",\"Epilepsy patients may be dependent on caregivers. Epilepsy patients suspected to be infected with COVID-19 should be isolated; the caregiver should seek treatment, especially through oral care or aspirations, for prevention and protection against J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19. Protection against COVID-19 also necessitates the treatment of COVID-19 carriers.\",\"Caregivers infected or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 should stop providing care to their patients and isolate themselves. They may also find replacements for their clients for the time being.\",\"As for epilepsy patients who live alone, it is suggested to keep regular contact with someone to inform that they are alright while self-isolating, especially patients with uncontrolled seizures.\",\"It is important to provide this information to epilepsy patients and their families so that they may be prevented from being infected with COVID-19. Additionally, the spread of correct information will reduce unnecessary anxiety and stress. According to Hu M. et al., educating epilepsy patients would reduce seizure frequency and accidental injuries caused by seizures [19] . Conversely, internet and social media can be a source of informal, uncertain, or misleading information that may cause people to respond erroneously or panic unnecessarily. A system for disseminating reliable resources of information needs to be established. A few medical associations and societies have provided useful information regarding epilepsy and COVID-19 ( Table 1 ) that may be shared. Translations and subsequent dissemination of these resources can also aid epilepsy patients globally. Moreover, the American epilepsy society have also provided information and attention points for clinicians.\",\"This article reviewed known facts of COVID-19 associated with epilepsy and the suggestions from medical societies. The effect of COVID-19 on individuals with epilepsy remains unclear.

We also consider social and demographic variables that have the potential to interact with or may cause health risks, such as smoking history or the inability to afford medical 15 care. For example, 11% of workers in industries deemed essential by the US government do not have health insurance (~10 million people). A lack of health care coverage or perceived inability to afford care could prevent patients from seeking treatment early, exacerbating risk of severe outcomes (11) .

The percentage of the workforce with any risk factor across all industries ranges from 71% to 93%. After removing obesity from the risk factor criteria, the proportion of the population categorized as at risk declines (56%), but the spatial dispersion grows, ranging from 37% to 75%. The highest risk is concentrated in the Midwest and the lowest in the Intermountain West and West Coast. As little as 5% of the 5 workforce over age 60 in some counties (e.g. Lander County, NV) has a risk factor, while in others, the percentage over age 60 and at-risk is over 40% (Martin County, IN) . Notable disparities exist within regions, states, and between neighboring counties. For example, Greene County, Ohio's workforce over 60 is twice as at risk than the workforce of bordering counties. This trend is found in clusters of both rural and urban counties, including those centered in 10 Marion, IN; Pulaski, MO; and Geary, KA. Somewhat counter-intuitively, there is no significant difference in the overall proportion of the total workforce at risk between rural and urban counties. However, outlier counties with extremely high or low proportions of at-risk workers are more likely to be rural and less populated. The proportion of the workforce at risk only ranged from 46% to 66% across urban counties, while the range across rural counties was from 15 37% to 75%. This is perhaps due to the small number of total workers and the low diversity of industries in rural counties relative to urban regions, or disparities in income between urban and rural locales.\",\"There is significant heterogeneity in risk between industries at the regional level, and this is even greater when broken down by county. A common trend is that sparsely populated 20 counties are most likely to have entire industries at relatively high or low risk. This is because there are few people in those counties working in any one industry. Thus, while transmission risks may be lower in sparsely populated areas, the consequences of infection may be greater for .

We enable comparisons between different combinations of filters by displaying the confidence intervals for all summary statistics within the dashboard. For example, in the Northeast United States, the proportion of the healthcare workforce that is over 60 and has an additional health risk factor (16.2% ± 2.2) is on average higher than in the rest of the country (12.2% ± 0.9). In contrast, the healthcare 10 workforce in counties in the south, mid-west, and west is more likely to delay seeking healthcare due to cost (9.3 ± .08) than in the Northeast (5.8% ±1.7). There are notable outliers in poorer Other examples of industries and areas with disproportionally high health risks compared to the surrounding areas include: the food systems industry, including transportation and warehousing services, the Texas Panhandle and South-central Florida, where the workforce is 20 nearly twice as likely to be over 60 and at risk than the national average; crop and animal production on the Atlantic seaboard from New Jersey to Maine; and oil and gas extraction and processing in Pennsylvania.

However, our analysis suggests countries can also mitigate overall risk by planning for and managing the consequences of infection. Developing these strategies necessitates identifying the consequences of infection at the community level. This involves understanding optimal resource allocation within hospitals and factors that influence hospital labor and materials supply (12, 13) . It also means planning 10 policies to respond to the exposure of sections of the broader labor force to COVID-19 complications.\",\"COVID-19 relief planning has focused on urban centers and areas where community transmission likely began earlier due to international travel, and is exacerbated through public transport, and tighter living quarters, such as New York City. Our analysis suggests that although 15 rural counties in the United States might have a relatively lower rates of transmission currently, portions of their populations can have a greater risk of hospitalization and death once infected.\",\"Essential industries in rural counties are made up of smaller, and sometimes more homogenous, workforces. As such, the absence of just a small number of essential workers could lead to the collapse of these industries, leaving entire communities without necessary goods and 20 services. For example, large meat processing plants in Iowa and Pennsylvania were shut down due to workers testing positive for the virus, and workers at a chicken processing plant in Georgia walked out in protest over being exposed to other employees with the virus (14, 15) .\",\"Larger industries in urban counties, on the other hand, are likely more resilient to worker .

As such, the small size of an industry is itself a risk factor. Consideration of this may be critical to the efficacy of policies to implement staged back-to-work policies in the US. Where rural workers are unlikely to be able to return to work, planning for enhanced mobility of replacement workers from urban centers may be beneficial. Similar strategies were adopted in China wherein essential healthcare workers 5 were moved into Hubei to support a dearth caused by increased infection rates and a more severe lockdown (16).\",\"Social distancing measures outside of urban centers in the United States are simplified by more physically spread out communities and a lack of public transport. However, workers in essential industries, such as hospitals, food systems and public services (utilities, public safety), 10 are less likely to be able to work from home (17). Furthermore, workers in rural and urban essential industries where working from home is less frequently an option, are more likely to have social risk factors, such as lack of insurance coverage or inability to afford medical care (11) . This category of workers is also more likely to be in the bottom half of the income distribution, less likely to be white, and less likely to have a college degree (11) . Therefore, it is 15 possible that the workers in the US most vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure are also the workers at the highest risk of hospitalization or death. The interplay of social and health risk factors will be important when considering where to focus relief efforts.\",\"Our analysis demonstrates important heterogeneity in susceptibility to COVID-19 between geographic areas, across industries, and depending on the most pertinent health and 20 social risk factors.

This is justified with COVID-19 confirmed case load being concentrated in particular localities in the United States, and as part of an effort to flatten the rate of increase of confirmed cases . However, we caution that efforts to contain the virus to urban and other hotspots may already have failed (e.g. Blaine County, Iowa), and therefore response efforts should now also consider the risk of disease severity in sectors of the population (2). This 5 requires a shift of focus to high-risk counties and industries. Failure to protect vulnerable workforces could lead to the breakdown of essential industries in these counties and cause avoidable deaths and hardship in their communities. It might also create further hotspots of viral transmission, allowing COVID-19 to resurge in cities as they manage a return-to-work strategy. .

Our keyword search consisted of the term \\\"COVID-19\\\" with at least one of the phrases \\\"risk factor,\\\" \\\"comorbidity,\\\" or \\\"case fatality.\\\" We selected relevant studies from the search results and created a list of risk factors shown to correlate with increased case severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. We then cross-referenced the complete list with a list of health risk factors created through text-and data-mining of medical literature by the 15 Kaggle Community, a subsidiary of Google LLC and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.\",\"We recognize that the consensus on which social, demographic, and physiological characteristics pose the greatest risk to COVID-19 patients will likely change as more data from different settings becomes available. Risk factors with marginal or inconclusive evidence (i.e. 20 smoking, asthma, obesity) are therefore included in the list despite the small number of articles available and the dynamic nature of the data sources.

We included variables for conditions leading to and encompassed by the term \\\"chronic respiratory diseases,\\\" including asthma, history of smoking, and lung cancer. 10 We pulled social and demographic variables in addition to health risk factors, including industry of employment, occupation, insurance coverage, ability to afford medical care, gender, and age. There is some evidence that male patients are significantly more likely to die from COVID-19 complications than female patients (21). Similarly, patients 40 years and over show an increasing risk of mortality, with patients aged 60 and over constituting the most at-risk group 15 (21,29) . In the United States, it is possible that lack of health care coverage or perceived inability to afford care will prevent patients from seeking treatment early on, leading to complications later. As with the health variables, we err on the side of including a variable in the study for added flexibility in future analysis using our dataset.\",\"We construct a dataset in R using the microdata downloaded from the IPUMs Health 20 Survey webpage (6) . We map NHIS survey responses to the presence or absence of each health and social risk factor and create additional categories for individuals of any age having at least one of the health risk factors and individuals over the age of 60 with at least one health risk .

We use industry and occupation codes for all survey participants to sort them into working and non-working populations and create a filter for essential industries using the Department of Homeland Security's criteria (30).\",\"Microdata is aggregated into summary statistics for each region, industry, and occupation using the srvyr package in R (24). First, we sum the number of survey respondents (n) in each 5 region-industry-occupation category. We do the same for the number of people in each regionindustry-occupation category for each social and health risk factor. Next, we use the sampling weight variable (sampweight) provided by IPUMs to map each survey respondent to the number of people in the United States workforce that their response represents, based on their demographic characteristics (6) . The region, occupation, and industry categories in IPUMS are 10 unique and mutually exclusive for each respondent, so they can be summed to get the number of people in different permutations of region, industry, and occupation. However, each survey respondent can have multiple health and social risk factors present, and those categories are not additive. The srvyr package provides variance estimates based on the stratified sample design of the NHIS (24). 15 The risk data were then merged with data on county-level employment from the Quarterly Census of Earnings and Wages (QCEW) (7). We use the 2018 annual averages QCEW NAICS-based data files to obtain annual estimates of employment by industry (at the 3-digit NAICS level) for all reporting counties in the U.S. These data represent the number of workers who are covered by Unemployment Insurance for each employer in the county. This does not 20 count self-employed workers and unpaid family workers, and might double-count workers who are employed by multiple firms within the year. Importantly, these data do not estimate the number of workers in the workforce, but rather the average number of jobs in each industry .

We use these data rather than estimates of the number of workers because they bear more significance in understanding the impacts of COVID-19 on potential disruptions to businesses and the U.S. economy, more broadly. For each county and industry, we sum employment across all ownership types (private and local, state, and federal government) to obtain one estimate of total annual employment per county and 3-digit NAICS industry. We then 5 match each NAICS industry to the corresponding NHIS industry to combine the employment figures with data on health risk factors.\",\"The health risk data from the NHIS is reported at the Census region while the QCEW is reported at the county. We apply the regional rates of health risk by industry to all counties within the region.

We rescale the regional statistical population (workers), , used to calculate the variance from the NHIS, by the county population of workers, : 15 We construct 90% confidence intervals based on the county level variance estimate, , which is unambiguously larger than the region variance estimate because the county population is less than the region.\",\"We created a dashboard and an interactive map to explore the finished data set using Tableau's interactive data visualization software.

modern human history, infectious diseases have posed a threat to public health several times. Coronavirus, which usually causes respiratory-tract infections in humans, has been linked to several infectious diseases and subsequent global challenges (1, 2). In December 2019, clusters of patients with viral pneumonia were confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus. The infection caused by the novel coronavirus was named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and this coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization and International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (3). As of March 31th, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has caused 81 554 infections and 3312 deaths in China (4), which far exceeds those caused by both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV worldwide. An increasing number of studies have suggested that people of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases. Moreover, human-to-human hospital-associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be possible (5, 6).\",\"This study aimed to provide additional data regarding the clinical features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and specifically to analyze the factors associated with disease severity, unimprovement, and mortality.\",\"All consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11th to February 6th, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. We obtained oral informed consent from all patients enrolled in the study. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in both the nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. The real-time RT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology Co Ltd). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.\",\"Our primary outcomes included disease severity at admission, unimprovement and mortality during follow-up. The disease severity and improvement were defined according to the interim guidelines from the World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China (7, 8). According to the patients’ symptoms, laboratory results and imaging findings at admission, the disease severity of COVID-19 patients (also known as patients’ conditions) can be divided into four types, including mild, moderate, severe, and critical conditions. Patients with slight clinical symptoms and without imaging findings of pneumonia are treated as mild condition. When patients have fever or respiratory symptoms, they are identified as moderate condition. If patients have one of the three situations, they are considered as severe condition: respiratory distress and the respiratory rate is higher than 30 times per minute; fingertip blood oxygen saturation is less than 93% at rest; Partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspiration oxygen (FiO2) ≤300mmHg. When patients contain one of the following three situation, they are identified as critical condition: respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation; shock condition; with other organ failure requires ICU treatment. Acute kidney injury was diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines (9). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition (10). Meanwhile, patients exhibiting one of the following situations during follow-up were considered to have improvement: continuously decreased temperature or normal temperature (below 37.3°C), improved respiratory symptoms (disappeared or obviously relieved), gradual reduction of pulmonary inflammation upon imaging analysis (obviously reduced shadow area), negative results of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection. Otherwise, they were considered to show unimprovement.\",\"Three physicians collected and reviewed the data. The epidemiological data, medical history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms and signs both at admission and during follow-up, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, real-time RT-PCR detection results, and survival data were obtained from patients’ electronic medical records. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptoms were noticed. Laboratory values and chest CT scans were collected at admission. Symptoms and signs at admission and during the hospital stay were also both collected. The clinical outcomes were followed up until February 9th, 2020.\",\"Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared using the χ2 test. Fisher’s exact test was also used to estimate continuous variables if one set contained less than 5 expected subjects. When continuous measurements were normally distributed, they were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and an independent group t-test was used. Otherwise, the interquartile range (IQR) values and the Mann-Whitney U test was used. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\",\"A logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with the primary outcomes. All variables associated with the primary outcomes were included in the univariate regression model. Variables with P < 0.05 level in previous analyses were entered into logistic multivariate regression models. Continuous variable was dichotomized. The variables included in the final model were selected by an automatic procedure. We tested in the model interactions that were significant on a stratified analysis Odds ratio (OR) was presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS software (version 19.0).\",\"A total of 663 COVID-19 patients confirmed via PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 were included in this study. The median age was 55.6 years (IQR, 44-69; range, 16-95 years). Among them, 321 (48.4%) were men, with a median age of 57.8 years (IQR, 46-70; range, 23-95 years), and 342 (51.6%) were women, with a median age of 57.8 years (IQR, 42-67; range, 16-90 years) (Table 1\\n). Most of the patients were either retirees (227, 34.2%) or employees (211, 31.8%). Of the 663 COVID-19 patients, 247 (37.3%) had at least one chronic disease. Cardiovascular diseases (21.1%), endocrine system disease (10.1%), and respiratory system disease (7.9%) were the three most common coexisting chronic diseases among the included patients.\",\"Among the 663 patients, at admission, 0.5% (n = 3) were classified as being mild COVID-19 condition, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were classified as moderate, severe, and critical, respectively (Table 1). The median ages of patients with mild-to-moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 were 49.1 (IQR, 36-61), 61.3 (IQR, 49-70), and 67.0 (IQR, 58.3-76.8) years, respectively, which exerted significantly differences (P < 0.001). Older patients (>60 years old) were more likely to exhibit severe and critical COVID-19 condition than others (≦ 60 years old, P < 0.001). Among the mild, moderate, severe, and critical patients, 100% (3/3), 76.5% (192/251), 60.0% (189/315), and 34.0% (32/94), respectively, had no chronic disease, which indicated that patients with chronic disease are more prone to severe forms of COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the presence of previously diagnosed respiratory (P = 0.003), cardiovascular (P=0.000), endocrine system (P = 0.007), and inflammatory diseases (P = 0.020) was associated with disease severity (Table 1).\",\"Regarding the symptoms, dyspnea (P < 0.001), chest tightness (P < 0.001), diarrhea (P = 0.003), fatigue (P = 0.015), dizziness (P = 0.009), muscle ache (P = 0.028), and unconsciousness (P = 0.020) were significantly linked to severe COVID-19 cases (Table 2\\n). Moreover, increased white blood cell (P < 0.001) and neutrophil counts (P < 0.001), decreased lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001), decreased hemoglobin (P < 0.001), increased ALT (P = 0.015) and/or AST (P < 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.001), increased CRP (P < 0.001), decreased albumin(P < 0.001), and increased LDH (P < 0.001) at admission were significantly associated with severe and critical disease conditions (Table 3\\n).\",\"A total of 251 (37.9%) patients were improved in hospital during follow-up (Table 1). The median age of these patients was 48.1 years (IQR, 34-60; range, 22-85 years) which was younger than patients without improvement (median age, 61.9; IQR, 52-72; range, 16-95 years, P < 0.001). Older patients (>60 years) were more prone to have no improvement than others (≦ 60 years old, P < 0.001). Among the patients with improvement, 103 (41.0%) were men and most of them (130, 51.8%) were employees. Moreover, 198 (251, 78.9%) patients with improvement had no chronic disease (Table 1), which is significantly higher than patients without improvement (219, 53.2%; P < 0.001).\",\"With respect to the systemic symptoms at admission, fever (P = 0.007), dizziness (P = 0.023), and muscle ache (P < 0.001) were found to influence patients’ improvement in hospital (Table 2). The patients who exhibited expectoration, dyspnea, and chest tightness at admission were more likely to respond to therapy and had better overall outcomes (P < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, respectively). However, digestive symptoms had no effect on patients’ improvement.\",\"At admission, increased white blood cell counts were significantly associated with patients who responded to treatment (P = 0.011). Moreover, when patients had neutrophil counts above the normal range, they were more likely to exhibit improved symptom during follow-up (P < 0.001). Patients with improvement were also found to have lymphocyte counts below the normal range (P < 0.001). Additionally, decreased hemoglobin (P = 0.006), increased ALT (P = 0.001) and/or AST (P < 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P < 0.001), increased CRP (P < 0.001), decreased albumin (P < 0.001), and increased LDH (P < 0.001) were also shown to be associated with COVID-19 improvement. Furthermore, patients with both unilateral pneumonia as diagnosed by CT scans were more likely to be improved (P < 0.001, Table 3).\",\"In univariate analysis, being male, severe and critical condition, expectoration, muscle ache, decreased albumin, decreased lymphocytes, older than 60, occupation, cardiovascular disease, dyspnea, chest tightness, fever, bilateral pneumonia, reduced hemoglobin, increased ALT, increased AST, increased LDH, damaged kidney function and increased CRP were associated with unimprovement in hospital. In multivariate analysis, being male (OR = 0.486, 95% CI 0.311-0.758; P = 0.001), having severe COVID-19 condition (OR = 0.129, 95% CI 0.082-0.201; P < 0.001), expectoration (OR = 1.796, 95% CI 1.062-3.036; P = 0.029), muscle ache (OR = 0.309, 95% CI 0.153-0.626; P = 0.001), and decreased albumin (OR = 1.929, 95% CI 1.199-3.104; P = 0.007) at admission were independent risk factors associated with unimprovement during follow-up. (Table 4\\n).\",\"Additionally, a total of 25 patients included in the study died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77% (Table 1). The median age of the deceased patients was 69.3 years (IQR, 61-78; range, 34-90 years), which is significantly higher than that of the survival patients (median age 56.1; IQR, 43-68; range, 16-95 years; P < 0.001). And older patients (>60 years) were significantly more likely to die in hospital than others (≦ 60 years old, P = 0.004). Eight of the dead patients (32.0%) had no chronic disease (Table 2). When comparing the dead and surviving patient populations, the only two symptoms which exhibited significant differences was dyspnea (P = 0.019) and unconsciousness (P < 0.001).\",\"Compared to other patients, the proportion of patients with increased white blood cell counts (P < 0.001), neutrophil counts above the normal range (P = 0.001), lymphocytes counts below the normal range (P = 0.006), increased ALT (P = 0.011) and/or AST (P = 0.001), increased serum creatinine and/or decreased glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.021), increased CRP (P = 0.014), decreased albumin (P = 0.005), and increased LDH (P = 0.046) at admission was higher among the deceased patient population (Table 3).\",\"In our study population, there were 247 patients who had at least one kind of chronic disease. Cardiovascular diseases, endocrine system disease, and respiratory system disease were the three most common coexisting chronic diseases. There were 91 patients who had no fever at admission. Additionally, 22 of the included COVID-19 patients did not exhibit any symptoms and were only found to be positive via the results of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Most patients had systemic, respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue were the three most common symptoms. On admission, most patients had white blood cell and neutrophil counts in the normal range and lymphocyte counts below the normal range. About a quarter of COVID-19 patients had differing degrees of hepatic function abnormality and one in ten patients had kidney function abnormality. Most patients had increased CRP, decreased albumin, and increased LDH. The vast majority of patients also had bilateral pneumonia in CT imaging.\",\"One-third of the patients were improved in hospital during follow-up. Twenty-five patients died and the mortality rate was 3.77%. The mortality rate in our study was lower than that indicated in a previous report but higher than that reported in another study (5, 11). This heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the case inclusion criteria. However, our results were closer to the mortality rate indicated by official national statistics, which is 3.97%. Cumulative studies confirmed that older age was associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In our study, older patients were prone to have severe COVID-19 symptoms, unimprovemrnt, and were more likely to die in hospitals. Based on previous findings in animal studies, older animals were shown to have stronger host innate immune responses to SARS-CoV infection (12). The unsatisfactory control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses in older individuals due to age-dependent defects was found to lead to a marked decline in cell-mediated immune function and reduced humoral immune function, which potentially leads to poor outcomes (13, 14).\",\"Fever, dizziness, muscle ache, expectoration, dyspnea, and chest tightness at admission were also found to influence patients’ improvement in hospital. Dyspnea and unconsciousness were the only two symptoms which were associated with mortality.\",\"A recent study reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid fragments in the stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted via the fecal-oral route (15). In our study, approximately one in six COVID-19 patients had digestive symptoms, especially diarrhea, which is more than was reported in a previous study (11). The digestive symptoms of most COVID-19 patients were mild, which seemed to be inconsistent with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A possible explanation is that SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum of COVID-19 patients is transmitted to the digestive tract through swallowing. There, under the action of various digestive enzymes, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive tract is weakened and the virus is degraded into fragments that only cause mild digestive symptoms but not serious gastrointestinal damage.\",\"In conclusion, being male, as well as having severe COVID-19 symptoms, expectoration, muscle ache, and decreased albumin were shown to be independent risk factors which influence patients’ improvement during follow-up. Older age was associated with poor conditions and outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\",\"All authors have made substantial contributions to and have approved the final manuscript.

is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, one of the five human coronaviruses of Betacoronavirus genius. While the aetiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not completely known, it has been reported that host cell entry is mediated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Xu et al., 2020), a protein expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma (Jia et al., 2020). As a result, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact, making it highly contagious.\",\"As of March 2020, more than 700,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 200 countries/territories. Upon the development of the pandemic, the number of deaths is expected to rise with elderly more vulnerable to fatality. A crude fatality ratio of 22% has been observed in Chinese patients aged above 80 years, much higher than the national overall of 3.8%, concluded from 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases (WHO, 2020).\",\"Unlike other respiratory diseases that have a “U”-shaped lethality curve (Raoult et al., 2020), mortality of COVID-19 increased with age while children were observed less susceptible to death. Despite the observation of increased vulnerability in elderly, literature concerning geriatric patients with COVID-19 remained very scant. Most of the studies were editorial commentaries (Nicol et al., 2020; Garnier-Crussard et al., 2020; Le Couteur et al., 2020; Doraiswamy et al., 2020) and clinical studies of a cohort of patients of varying ages admitted to a hospital with a slight highlight on the association between age and clinical manifestations (Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Given that elderly aged 60 or above only accounted for about 6% of the total Chinese population, clinical studies based on a single hospital may not be informative. Against this background, the present study identified the risk factors for predicting mortality in elderly patients with COVID-19 by reviewing the clinical data of deceased and discharged COVID-19 patients gathered from the public domain.\",\"Elderly patients were defined as those diagnosed with COVID-19 of age 60 or above. Due to data availability, clinical data of individuals reported by the media and Chinese health authorities were sought by performing a search on Google. Two searches were performed, one with the search terms “death”, “pneumonia” and “age” for the clinical data of deceased patients whereas the other with the search terms “discharge”, “pneumonia” and “age” for the clinical data of surviving patients that served as controls. The inclusion criteria were (i) elderly patients diagnosed with COVID-19, (ii) exact date of discharge or death, and (iii) symptoms on admission. There was no language restriction.\",\"The following data were collected: (i) gender, (ii) age, (iii) travel history to Hubei, (iv) time from symptom onset to admission, (v) time from admission to discharge/death, (vi) symptoms on admission and (vii) comorbidities. Only the comorbidities of deceased patients were included as that of surviving patients were usually not reported by the media.\",\"Statistical tests on the difference in measures (i) to (vi) between the deceased and surviving patient groups were performed and a logistic regression model was estimated to identify risk factors for mortality with the stepwise regression procedure for independent variable selection.\",\"A total of 154 individual cases in 26 provinces, including 89 deceased patients and 65 surviving patients, were identified from 86 sources originating from the official web pages of Chinese health authorities and the media under the supervision of the Chinese government such as Xinhua, Sina and the Paper. The data of 73 patients were abstracted from 22 government sources, defined as web pages with the domain “.gov”. Sina, Chinanews, People’s Daily and Xinhua were the other common sources, providing the data of 10, 7, 6, and 5 patients, respectively. Most cases were reported in Hubei (40 cases), followed by Shanghai (33 cases) and Henan (10 cases). Table 1, Table 2\\nillustrate the results.\",\"Gender did not appear to be a mortality risk factor as demonstrated by the insignificant difference in the male proportion between the deceased and surviving group. However, age played an important role as shown by the significant difference. The difference in the proportion between the two groups varied as age increased. The proportion of deceased patients aged 60-69 was significantly smaller than that of surviving patients (p < 0.001) whereas the proportion of deceased patients aged 80 or above was significantly larger than that of surviving patients (p = 0.014). The crude OR also increased as age increased. For patients of age 80 or above, the crude OR was significantly greater than one (Fig. 1\\n).\",\"Although the median time from symptom onset to admission was longer in deceased patients, the difference was found insignificant. There was significant difference in the median time from admission to death/discharge with 50% of the deceased patients expired within nine days after admission.\",\"It is not surprising that cough and fever were the most commonly seen symptoms in patients with COVID-19. While cough was equally observed in both groups, deceased patients were less susceptible to fever. There was no significant difference in symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection between the two groups, including cough, sore throat and nasal congestion/rhinorrhea. However, symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection were more prominent in deceased patients. In comparison with surviving patients, deceased patients had approximately six-fold and three-fold higher prevalence of dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort, respectively. Another interesting observation was the prominence of muscle ache in deceased patients. The difference in other symptoms such as chill and diarrhea was found insignificant.\",\"Age, fever and diarrhea were selected by the stepwise regression procedure in the logistic regression model. With the exception of diarrhea, the adjusted OR of age and fever were found significantly different from one. While older age was associated with mortality (adjusted OR = 1.04), fever was less likely to occur in deceased patients (adjusted OR = 0.23).\",\"The most commonly observed comorbidities in deceased patients were hypertension (53.2%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (42.0%), and diabetes (37.8%). Other comorbidities such as liver and neurological diseases were unlikely to be associated with mortality given the low prevalence observed.\",\"Given that elderly only accounted for a small proportion of the total Chinese population and that clinical studies based on a single hospital are less likely informative, the present study reviewed the clinical data of geriatric COVID-19 patients gathered from different sources reported by the media and Chinese health authorities.\",\"Findings suggested by the baseline characteristics of the patients were generally in line with existing studies. Advanced age remained associated with mortality as documented in literature (Leung, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The present study further enhanced the understanding of mortality by age stratification in geriatric patients. Furthermore, the inclusion of age in the logistic regression model suggested that it was an independent risk factor for mortality.\",\"The significant difference in time from admission to final clinical outcome between the two groups shed light on the clinical course of elderly patients. Although half of the deceased patients expired within nine days after admission, half of all surviving patients were discharged at least 17 days after admission, suggestive of long and erratic clinical course of geriatric patients.\",\"It is not surprising to see higher prevalence of dyspnoea in deceased patients. Pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnoea and haemoptysis have usually been observed in patients with severe pneumonia, regardless of age. A study of 138 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 aged between 22 and 92 years old found that dyspnoea was more commonly seen in patients admitted to ICU (Wang et al., 2020a). In contrast, the prominence of muscle ache in deceased patients was unusual. Muscle ache in patients with COVID-19 was not common and was only reported in two clinical studies. It was seen in 11% of 99 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital between 1st and 20th January 2020 (Chen et al., 2020). In a study describing 28 COVID-19 cases confirmed in South Korea, 14% of the patients were reported to have muscle ache (COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center, 2020).\",\"While the lower prevalence of fever in deceased patients was surprising, a study of 913 patients (75% of them aged 65 or above) with bacterial infection found that lower body temperature was associated with increased risk for mortality (Yamamoto et al., 2006). In fact, the data in the present study suggested that patients without fever were more likely to be older (crude OR 0.952. 95% CI 0.910, 0.996). This phenomenon is not uncommon and perhaps overlooked. A recent study reviewing the clinical features of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hainan General Hospital found significant difference in the prevalence of fever between young and middle-aged, and elderly patients (Liu et al., 2020). However, the authors did not further discuss this finding. It has also been suggested that approximately 20%-30% of elderly patients with serious bacterial or viral infection presented with a blunted or even no fever (Norman, 2000). It is likely because of the lower baseline body temperature in elderly due to aging (Castle et al., 1991; Obermeyer et al., 2017; Güneş and Zaybak, 2008; Lu et al., 2010; Simonsick et al., 2016) which may translate to a lower maximum temperature of fever (Norman, 2000). This suggests that the usual temperature threshold for fever should not be used as a case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients. In fact, a study on a total of 111 nursing home residents found that lowering the threshold for a clinically significant fever increased the sensitivity of detecting infections (Castle et al., 1993). However, it is not recommended to lower the temperature threshold in the case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients because an individual’s baseline body temperature is also determined by a range of demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and physiological measurements (Obermeyer et al., 2017). To assist surveillance against the current pandemic, elderly should measure on a regular basis the baseline body temperature that can be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. If this is not feasible, a baseline body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius might be used instead (Güneş and Zaybak, 2008).\",\"Studies concerning the association between comorbid conditions and mortality/disease severity in the Chinese COVID-19 patients of all ages showed mixed results. In a study including 140 patients admitted to No.7 Hospital of Wuhan, no significant difference in the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease was observed between severe and non-severe patients (Zhang et al., 2020). In contrast, the opposite was observed between 54 deceased and 137 surviving patients admitted to Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Zhou et al., 2020). The difference in the proportion of patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease between the two groups was significant even at 1% level of significance.\",\"For COVID-19 patients aged 60 years or above, the data of the present study may shed some light on the association between comorbidities and mortality, despite without a control. A recent hypertension prevalence study in the Chinese population found that hypertension was observed in 58.4% of Chinese aged 60 or above (Lu et al., 2017) which falls between 41.6% and 64.5%, the 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients with hypertension (Table 2). Therefore, whether mortality is associated with hypertension in geriatric patients remains uncertain. Similar observations were found in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and stroke. The prevalence of COPD and stroke in the Chinese population aged 60 or above were found to be 15.5% (Zhong et al., 2007) (or higher given the recent increasing trend (Wang et al., 2018)) and 11%-14% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively. The 95% CI of the prevalence of COPD and stroke in the deceased patients considered in the present study were 7.8%-25.4% and 5.7%-21.8%, respectively. In contrast, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) might be associated with mortality. The prevalence of diabetes and CHD in the Chinese population aged 60 or above was found 19%-21% (Wang et al., 2017) and 6%-7% (Wang et al., 2020b), respectively, failing to overlap with the corresponding 95% CI of the proportion of deceased patients included in the present study.\",\"Finally, the results presented here were somewhat different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), despite genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In a study aiming to discuss the clinical manifestations and prognosis of patients with SARS aged 60 or above, age, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia were identified by the crude OR as mortality risk factors whereas no independent mortality risk factors were found by the logistic regression (Cao et al., 2003). The present study, however, found that age and fever were mortality risk factors. To conclude, further research should be done to identify comorbidities associated with mortality given very diverse results in existing literature.\",\"The major limitation of the present work is that only baseline characteristics were considered as mortality risk factors. Because of the lack of data, lab findings and physiological measures were left unstudied.\",\"The author declares no conflict of interest.\"],\"tags\":{\"sciwingI2B2\":{\"0,0\":\"problem\",\"0,3\":\"problem\",\"0,4\":\"problem\",\"0,11\":\"problem\",\"0,12\":\"problem\",\"0,13\":\"problem\",\"0,15\":\"problem\",\"0,23\":\"problem\",\"0,33\":\"test\",\"0,34\":\"test\",\"0,35\":\"test\",\"0,39\":\"problem\",\"0,40\":\"problem\",\"0,41\":\"problem\",\"0,49\":\"test\",\"0,52\":\"problem\",\"0,53\":\"problem\",\"0,54\":\"problem\",\"0,58\":\"problem\",\"0,59\":\"problem\",\"0,67\":\"test\",\"0,72\":\"problem\",\"0,73\":\"problem\",\"0,75\":\"problem\",\"0,79\":\"problem\",\"1,9\":\"problem\",\"1,27\":\"problem\",\"1,39\":\"test\",\"1,40\":\"test\",\"1,41\":\"test\",\"2,1\":\"problem\",\"2,2\":\"problem\",\"2,3\":\"problem\",\"2,7\":\"problem\",\"2,8\":\"problem\",\"2,9\":\"problem\",\"2,16\":\"problem\",\"2,32\":\"problem\",\"2,33\":\"problem\",\"2,36\":\"problem\",\"2,38\":\"problem\",\"2,39\":\"problem\",\"2,41\":\"test\",\"2,48\":\"test\",\"2,50\":\"test\",\"2,51\":\"test\",\"2,56\":\"test\",\"2,60\":\"test\",\"2,61\":\"test\",\"2,65\":\"test\",\"2,70\":\"test\",\"2,71\":\"test\",\"2,78\":\"problem\",\"2,79\":\"problem\",\"2,86\":\"problem\",\"2,87\":\"problem\",\"2,94\":\"problem\",\"2,95\":\"problem\",\"2,100\":\"test\",\"2,119\":\"test\",\"2,121\":\"test\",\"2,122\":\"test\",\"2,136\":\"test\",\"2,137\":\"test\",\"2,143\":\"problem\",\"2,144\":\"problem\",\"2,149\":\"problem\",\"3,8\":\"problem\",\"3,16\":\"test\",\"3,18\":\"test\",\"3,19\":\"test\",\"3,21\":\"test\",\"3,35\":\"test\",\"3,38\":\"test\",\"3,39\":\"test\",\"3,48\":\"test\",\"3,50\":\"treatment\",\"3,53\":\"test\",\"3,54\":\"test\",\"3,66\":\"test\",\"3,68\":\"treatment\",\"3,99\":\"problem\",\"3,105\":\"problem\",\"4,28\":\"problem\",\"5,0\":\"test\",\"5,1\":\"test\",\"5,14\":\"test\",\"5,15\":\"test\",\"5,16\":\"test\",\"5,21\":\"test\",\"5,22\":\"test\",\"5,23\":\"test\",\"5,28\":\"problem\",\"5,29\":\"problem\",\"5,31\":\"problem\",\"5,34\":\"treatment\",\"5,35\":\"treatment\",\"5,36\":\"treatment\",\"5,38\":\"treatment\",\"5,39\":\"treatment\",\"6,58\":\"test\",\"6,62\":\"test\",\"6,63\":\"test\",\"6,73\":\"test\",\"6,100\":\"problem\",\"6,104\":\"problem\",\"6,107\":\"test\",\"6,109\":\"test\",\"7,0\":\"test\",\"7,7\":\"problem\",\"7,8\":\"problem\",\"7,9\":\"problem\",\"7,91\":\"problem\",\"7,106\":\"test\",\"9,5\":\"problem\",\"9,7\":\"problem\",\"9,11\":\"problem\",\"9,12\":\"problem\",\"9,13\":\"problem\",\"9,19\":\"problem\",\"9,39\":\"problem\",\"9,41\":\"problem\",\"9,42\":\"problem\",\"9,43\":\"problem\",\"9,44\":\"problem\",\"9,51\":\"problem\",\"9,52\":\"problem\",\"9,54\":\"problem\",\"9,57\":\"problem\",\"9,59\":\"problem\",\"9,60\":\"problem\",\"9,61\":\"problem\",\"9,62\":\"problem\",\"9,84\":\"problem\",\"9,86\":\"problem\",\"9,96\":\"problem\",\"9,97\":\"problem\",\"9,104\":\"problem\",\"9,105\":\"problem\",\"9,108\":\"problem\",\"9,110\":\"problem\",\"10,1\":\"problem\",\"10,3\":\"problem\",\"10,8\":\"treatment\",\"10,9\":\"treatment\",\"10,10\":\"treatment\",\"10,13\":\"test\",\"10,14\":\"test\",\"10,27\":\"problem\",\"10,40\":\"problem\",\"10,45\":\"problem\",\"11,2\":\"problem\",\"11,3\":\"problem\",\"11,4\":\"problem\",\"11,9\":\"problem\",\"11,11\":\"problem\",\"11,13\":\"problem\",\"11,14\":\"problem\",\"11,17\":\"problem\",\"11,20\":\"problem\",\"11,23\":\"problem\",\"11,25\":\"problem\",\"11,26\":\"problem\",\"11,33\":\"problem\",\"11,36\":\"problem\",\"11,37\":\"problem\",\"12,16\":\"test\",\"12,17\":\"test\",\"13,14\":\"test\",\"13,21\":\"problem\",\"13,28\":\"test\",\"13,33\":\"test\",\"13,34\":\"test\",\"13,54\":\"test\",\"13,55\":\"test\",\"13,56\":\"test\",\"14,1\":\"problem\",\"14,2\":\"problem\",\"14,57\":\"treatment\",\"15,9\":\"problem\",\"15,13\":\"problem\",\"15,14\":\"problem\",\"15,17\":\"problem\",\"15,19\":\"problem\",\"15,27\":\"problem\",\"15,33\":\"test\",\"15,39\":\"test\",\"15,49\":\"problem\",\"15,68\":\"problem\",\"15,69\":\"problem\",\"15,75\":\"problem\",\"15,76\":\"problem\",\"15,80\":\"problem\",\"15,118\":\"test\",\"15,121\":\"problem\",\"15,122\":\"problem\",\"15,135\":\"problem\",\"15,136\":\"problem\",\"15,138\":\"test\",\"15,140\":\"test\",\"16,5\":\"problem\",\"16,12\":\"test\",\"16,24\":\"problem\",\"16,25\":\"problem\",\"16,28\":\"problem\",\"16,29\":\"problem\",\"16,30\":\"problem\",\"16,37\":\"problem\",\"16,45\":\"test\",\"16,48\":\"test\",\"16,49\":\"test\",\"16,54\":\"problem\",\"16,65\":\"test\",\"16,69\":\"problem\",\"16,77\":\"test\",\"16,78\":\"test\",\"16,98\":\"problem\",\"16,131\":\"problem\",\"16,132\":\"problem\",\"16,133\":\"problem\",\"16,134\":\"problem\",\"16,135\":\"problem\",\"16,139\":\"problem\",\"16,143\":\"problem\",\"16,152\":\"problem\",\"16,160\":\"problem\",\"16,165\":\"treatment\",\"16,169\":\"test\",\"16,173\":\"test\",\"16,177\":\"test\",\"16,186\":\"problem\",\"16,187\":\"problem\",\"16,188\":\"problem\",\"16,190\":\"problem\",\"16,201\":\"problem\",\"16,211\":\"problem\",\"16,218\":\"test\",\"16,234\":\"problem\",\"16,235\":\"problem\",\"16,236\":\"problem\",\"16,241\":\"

disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging lethal respiratory disease from December 2019 [1]. Full-genome sequencing analysis has indicated that the pathogen is a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2]. Since first identified, the epidemic scale of the recently emerged COVID-19 has increased rapidly, with cases arising across China and other countries [3,4].\",\"Recently, a few studies have revealed the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [1,5]. Huang et al indicated that 32% of patients were admitted to an ICU and 15% of patients died among the 41 hospitalized patients, and the ICU patients had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines [1]. Wang et al proved that patients treated in the ICU were older men with comorbidities, dyspnea, and anorexia compared with those not treated in the ICU among 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [6]. Nevertheless, the predictive risk factors for the poor outcomes of COVID-19 patients remain unclear.\",\"We, therefore, collected the data of clinical manifestations together with detailed laboratory examination and attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\",\"The laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted to Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 13 to February 16 in 2020 were enrolled.

This study was approved by the ethics committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and complied with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was waived because of the urgent situation and the retrospective nature by the ethics commission.\",\"A total of 111 patients were included. The medical history, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, radiologic assessments, laboratory findings on admission, and treatment strategies were extracted and cross-checked from electronic medical records. Comorbidities included hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, and malignancy. Numbers of pulmonary lobe involved were evaluated by chest computed tomography on admission. Laboratory tests on admission comprised complete blood count, liver and renal function, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by the RT-PCR assay conducted in accordance with the protocol established by the WHO [7]. All laboratory tests were performed using commercial kits in the department of clinical laboratory of Union Hospital. The preliminary assessment of disease severity was developed by 6-category ordinal scale of clinical status on admission as follows: category 6, death; 5, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation; 4, ICU hospitalization, not requiring ECMO and/or invasive mechanical ventilation; 3, non-ICU hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen; 2, non-ICU hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 1, hospital discharge [8].\",\"The primary outcome was the disease deterioration, including the transfer from isolation ward to ICU and all-cause death. The included patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical outcomes: group with favorable prognosis (discharge after recovery) and group with poor prognosis (disease deterioration).\",\"Continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared with χ² test or Fisher’s exact test between discharged and deteriorated group. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Odds ratio (OR) for poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression adjusted for selected confounders: age, gender, comorbidity, body temperature, number of pulmonary lobe involved, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein level, IL-6 level, and IL-10 level on admission. For this analysis, the upper limit of IQRs of this cohort was used as the cut-off values for age (57 years), CRP (39.0 mg/L), IL-6 (15.7 pg/ml), and IL-10 (5.1 pg/ml), respectively. A two-tailed p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out with SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).\",\"The clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1\\n. The median age was 38.0 years (IQR, 32.0 to 57.0), and 46 (41.4%) patients were males. 33.3% of patients had at least one comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, and chronic liver disease). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (71.2%), cough (37.8%), fatigue (18.0%), and dyspnea (16.2%). Symptoms including diarrhea (9.0%), pharyngalgia (6.3%), myalgia (6.3%), and headache (3.6%) were rare. The median duration from illness onset to admission was 7 days (IQR, 5.0 to 10.0). Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged, and 18 patients were deteriorated, although there was no significant difference in scale of clinical status on admission between these two groups. Of the 18 deteriorated patients, 15 patients had died and 3 patients remained hospitalized in ICU up to Feb 26th, 2020.\",\"Compared with the discharged patients, the deteriorated patients were significantly older (median age, 36.0 years [IQR, 31.0-47.5]) vs 60.0 years [IQR, 48.5-81.5], have more underlying comorbidities (22 [23.7%] vs 15 [83.3%]), and were more likely to report dyspnea (9 [9.7%] vs 9 [50.0%]). Days from illness onset to admission were not different between discharged and deteriorated patients. Increased proportions of elevated body temperature, respiratory frequency, and systolic pressure were higher in the deteriorated group compared with the discharged group.\",\"\\nTable 2\\nshows the laboratory findings on admission. White blood cell counts (6.51 G/L [4.03-10.10] vs 3.97 G/L [3.14-5.72]) and neutrophil counts (5.68 G/L [3.10-9.37] vs 2.34 G/L [1.82-3.51]) were higher, whereas lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) were lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The proportions of liver dysfunction (12 [66.67%] vs 21 [22.58%]) were increased in the deteriorated patients compared with the discharged patients. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00-5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), CRP (79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 pg/ml (35.72 [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with the discharged patients.\",\"During hospitalization, the treatments of these patients were adjusted according to the patient's condition (Table 3\\n). All patients received antiviral therapy, mostly antibacterial therapy. Corticosteroids were given to 27.0% of cases, and more in dead cases than discharged cases (88.9% vs 15.1%). All the deteriorated patients required mechanical ventilation, and ECMO was employed in one severe case.\",\"The main baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics by CRP quartiles are shown in Table 4\\n. The patients with elevated CRP levels had a greater proportion of comorbidity and dyspnea. Age, lymphopenia, IL-6/IL-10 concentrations, and the numbers of pulmonary lobe involved were increased with the rising CRP level. And most of the deteriorated patients (88.9%) were divided into the last quartile of CRP levels (>39.00 mg/L).\",\"The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis are shown in Table 5\\n. The 14 significant variables were included. After adjusted, male gender (OR, 24.8 [1.8-342.1]), comorbidity (OR, 52.6 [3.6-776.4]), lymphopenia (OR, 17.3 [1.1-261.8]), and elevated CRP (OR, 96.5 [4.6-2017.6]) were found as the significant risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.\",\"We report here a cohort of 111 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In this cohort, most patients presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, upper respiratory tract signs and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, suggesting different viral tropism as compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9,10].\",\"Among these 111 patients in isolation ward at baseline, 93 (83.8%) patients were discharged, and 18 (16.2%) were deteriorated. Those patients with poor prognosis were older male patients with more comorbidities, dyspnea, higher neutrophil count, lower lymphocyte count, more liver dysfunction, and increased numbers of pulmonary lobe involved from chest CT images. Moreover, we noted that patients with poor prognosis also had high amounts of CRP, IL-6, and IL-10 on admission. For further multivariate analysis of these risk factors, male, comorbidity, lymphopenia, and obviously elevated CRP were the significant predictors of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.\",\"Hypertension was the dominant comorbidity in this study. The proportion of COVID-19 patients with hypertension was significantly increased in those with poor prognosis. Molecular modeling revealed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]. ACE2 could be up-regulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or blockade of Angiotensin II Receptors (ARB) in liver and heart [12,13]. Thus, an increased entry of coronaviruses into host cells might be found in COVID-19 patients complicated with hypertension taking ACEI or ARB, resulting in the poor prognosis.\",\"Lymphopenia is a common feature of coronavirus infection [5,9,10]. Lymphocyte apoptosis directly induced by coronaviruses might be the major cause of lymphopenia [14,15]. Yang et al observed that as the SARS patients improved, T lymphocyte counts gradually returned to the normal ranges [16]. Thus, lymphopenia is temporally associated with disease severity [17].\",\"Besides the direct attack from virus, progressive inflammatory injury has been suggested as the possible mechanism in COVID-19 [1]. CRP is a downstream acute phase protein in the innate immune response [18]. It is produced because of the increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate the immune response [19]. Therefore, serum CRP level has been often used as a laboratory marker of inflammation [18,19]. A few studies indicated that CRP is a predictive factor for disease progression in MERS-CoV- and H1N1- infected patients [20,21]. In this study, we first reported that CRP could also be the predictor for the progression of COVID-19.\",\"In view of the excessive inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infections, corticosteroids are used for the treatment of patients with severe illness to reduce inflammatory-induced lung injury. However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests the significant effect of corticosteroids on mortality [22,23]. As different from the extensive anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids, the drugs specific for inflammasome/IL-1β/IL-6/CRP axis might show their advantages [24,25]. Thus, CRP might not only be the predictor for the poor prognosis but also an indicator for anti-inflammatory therapy.\",\"There are some limitations in this study. First, this is a single center study with a small sample size. The 95% CI of OR is relatively large. Second, it is a retrospective study, and the results need to be further verified by prospective studies. Third, we aimed to study the risk factors of prognosis. But the sample size in the poor prognosis group is small. Moreover, we were unable to analyze the differences in clinical characteristics of patients in the poor prognosis group due to the small sample size. Fourth, we missed asymptomatic and mild cases managed at home, and hence our cohort might represent the more severe population of COVID-19. Fifth, a few risk factors such as viral load, viral antibody titers, and cause of death were not available in this study. Sixth, the treatment of these patients was clinically driven and not unified standard.\",\"In conclusions, male gender, comorbidity, lymphopenia, and elevated CRP are the risk factors for the poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Our findings would facilitate the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients, especially in primary hospitals.\",\"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in
