Sections were treated sequentially with 3% normal sheep (or rabbit) serum, the primary antisera, sheep antirabbit (or goat) IgG diluted 1:40, rabbit (or goat) PAP diluted 1 :80, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine HCl with hydrogen peroxide. All dilutions were made with 0.5 M Tris buffer.\", \"The following antibodies were used at the second step: anti-HSV-1 rabbit serum (diluted 1:500) for detection of HSV-I virus antigens, anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) goat serum (diluted 1:500) for CNS and PNS myelin, anti-Po glycoprotein rabbit serum (diluted 1:500) for PNS myelin protein, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (diluted 1 : 1,000) rabbit serum for astrocytes. Anti-HSV antibody (500 neutralizing units) was obtained from a New Zealand White rabbit after multiple intravenous inoculations of lo8 PFU of HSV. Immunocytochemical controls for HSV antigen detection included trigeminal ganglion sections from uninfected mice incubated with the anti-HSV serum and also sections from infected mice incubated with nonimmune rabbit serum. Both of these controls were invariably negative for immunoperoxidase staining. Immunoreactivity and control studies of anti-MBP serum IS], anti-Po serum (61, or anti-GFAP serum [ 7 } are described elsewhere.\", \"The double staining method was used for the simultaneous identification and localization of two antigens (GFAP and HSV antigens) by using a modification of procedures described by Erlandsen and colleagues IS]. To obtain two different colors, the following substrates of peroxidase were used; 3,3'-diaminobenzidine for brown reaction products and 4-CI-1 naphthol for blue reaction products. The blue reaction produced by 4-CI-1 naphthol tends to fade a few hours after immunostaining, so co-localization of GFAP and HSV antigens to the same cells was confirmed by serial examination of the slides and recording the loss of the blue color from the doubly stained cells.\", \"Attempts were made to identify by immunohistochemistry oligodendroglia with antisera, but consistently satisfactory immunostaining could not be obtained in this formalin-fixed material. Also, attempts were made to do electronmicroscopy by removing the paraffin-embedded pons and trigeminal roots used for immunohistochemical staining and reembedding the tissue in epon resin for thin sectioning. Review of this material identified degenerating astrocytes containing viral particles. Poor morphological details due to mercuric chloride fixation, however, precluded definitive study and presentation of the electronmicrographs.\", \"To compare the immunocytochemical findings observed in HSV-induced demyelinated lesions with other cases of demyelination, we reexamined immunocytochemically lesions of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and acute multiple sclerosis (MS). We immunostained paraffin sections of pontine lesions of EAE rats killed 10 and 14 days after immunization [9}, and sections of cerebral lesions of PML (Patient 4; 61-year old man) [lo] and pontine lesions of acute MS (Patient 1; 6-year-old girl) [ll}. The antibodies used were anti-MBP goat serum and anti-GFAP rabbit serum at a dilution of 1:500 and 1:1,000, respectively.\", \"The CNS-PNS transition in the trigeminal root was clearly demonstrated by GFAP-stained dial cells in the CNS portion and Po-stained PNS myelin in the PNS portion (Fig 1) . MBP antiserum stained both the CNS and PNS myelin. HSV immunoreactivity was never observed in the normal trigeminal ganglia, roots, or pons.\", \"HSV immunoreactivity first appeared in neurons within the trigeminal ganglion on day 2 PI. In the ganglion, the HSV-stained neurons and satelhe cells rapidly increased in number on day 4 PI and decreased on day 6 PI, and stained cells were no longer detected on day 8 PI, as already reported [12] . In the trigeminal root, HSV immunoreactivity was observed in some glial cells in the CNS part of the TREZ on day 4 PI (Fig 2) . Most of the HSV-stained glial cells were morphologically normal. There was no inflammatory cell infiltration around these HSV-stained glial cells. Immunostaining of GFAP, MBP, and Po was generally normal. O n day 6 PI, the HSV-stained glial cells increased in number. The distribution of infected cells was restricted to the medial aspect of the CNS part of the root extending from the PNS-CNS transitional zone to the junction of the pons (Fig 3) . In the lesions, many HSV-stained glial cells were destroyed to small fragments or debris. With double immunostaining, most HSV-stained cells or their fragments were also stained with anti-GFAP serum (Fig 4) . Most of the astrocytes, doubly stained with GFAP and HSV antiserum, were degenerating within such a restricted area. Therefore, the lesion was observed as an area lacking in GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig 5) . In contrast to the remarkable changes in the astrocytes, the CNS and PNS myelinated fibers were immunocytochemically or morphologically normal, except for a few CNS fibers with an altered immunoreactivity near the infiltrating mononuclear cells (see Fig 5) . O n day 8 PI, CNS myelinated fibers began to change, both immunocytochemically and morphologically in the area where GFAP staining was completely lacking. Here, the HSV-stained glial cells were no longer observed in the lesion. O n day 10 PI, an active destruction of CNS myelin was apparent and an area lacking in MBP immunostaining was evident. Interestingly, the extent of the demyelinated lesions was similar to the area where the GFAP immunostaining was lacking and the demyelination never extended beyond the area lacking GFAP \", \"In demyelinating lesions of EAE (10 and 14 days PI), PML, and acute MS, actively demyelinating changes were observed, as described elsewhere {9-11) (Fig 8) . Alteration or loss of MBP immunoreactivity was observed in the degenerating myelin sheaths. MBPstained myelin debris or macrophages containing MBP-stained materials were numerous, yet astrocytes were intact immunocytochemically and morphologically, even near infiltrating mononuclear cells or macrophages. O n the contrary, the GFAP-stained astrocytes were increased in number and immunoreactivity in the surrounding lesions compared with findings in the control rat CNS or nonneurological control brains. In these lesions, there were hypertrophic astrocytes heavily stained with GFAP antiserum. [ 13) and coronavirus infection in mice ation in T-cell-deficient (nude) mice and cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice inoculated with HSV by the corneal route. Even in immunocompetent mice, only rare macrophages were noted stripping myelin lamellae, and it was supposed that bystander rather than immune-specific demyelination was the main mechanism, with demyelination produced by proteases released from activated macrophages 120). Obtaining the opposite result of more widespread and severe de- 4 ) indicates that at the early stage, the HSV-1 infection is overwhelmingly in astrocytes. There is rapid lysis of astrocytes as shown by focal areas in which GFAP immunostaining is completely lost by 6 days after HSV inoculation. Loss of MBP immunostaining indicating demyelination begins just after this extensive lysis of astrocytes, and the area of demyelination as defined by loss of MBP immunostaining is strictly confined to the area of astrocyte destruction as shown by loss of GFAP immunostaining. In contrast, we have found in lesions of acute MS and in early lesions of PML and EAE that there are no degenerative changes in astrocytes, morphologically or immunocytochemically; but we did observe reactive astrocytes or astrocytosis in these lesions. Therefore, it is likely that the early loss of astrocytes is characteristic of HSV-induced demyelination and not other demyelinating lesions.\", \"Astrocytes have long been thought to play a skeletal role in the CNS, separating various synapses and serving as a means of nutrient transport from blood to neurons; and astrocyte proliferation is a well-known response to nonspecific CNS damage. The astrocyte also plays an immunological role for presenting antigen to T lymphocytes {29]. They express major histocompatibility complex class 1 antigen on their surface and would be targets for class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes [30}. In addition, recent experimental studies have suggested the requirement of astrocytes for regeneration of CNS myelin {31-337.\", \"On the basis of the studies reported here, it is tempting to speculate that the rapid astrocyte destruction itself contributes to HSV-induced demyelination. Neither the temporal sequence of astrocyte loss preceding demyelination nor the correspondence in areas of astrocyte destruction and demyelination, however, prove a cause and effect relation. It has been shown that HSV infection in oligodendroglia follows a longer time course and there is relative preservation of oligo-dendroglia at the time of extensive astrocyte loss and onset of destruction of myelin lamellae [1, 251, but we cannot exclude oligodendroglia damage as a cause of the demyelination. More detailed study of HSV-1 infection in oligodendroglia is needed to help determine the significance of the early astrocyte loss in this model.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n

filling and reduced diastolic volume of either or both ventricles, with normal or near-normal systolic function and wall thickness (Richardson et al., 1996). A variety of specific pathological processes can cause RCM, including endomyocardial scarring, myocardial fibrosis or infiltrative disorders (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). These conditions are divided into two distinct groups in man: those with predominant endocardial involvement (endomyocardial form) and others with predominant myocardial involvement (myocardial form) (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). This classification of RCM also appears to be applicable to cats (Ferasin et al., 2003, Fox, 2004) and the endomyocardial type, also known as endomyocardial fibrosis, is the most prevalent form of feline RCM (Bond and Fox, 1984, Kimura et al., 2016).\", \"A prominent pathological feature of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM is severe and extensive fibrous thickening of the endocardium and chamber deformity (Fox, 2004). This process primarily affects the left ventricle (LV) or, rarely, both ventricles. There are two basic morphological patterns of endocardial fibrosis, although a degree of overlap in features may occur (Fox, 2004). In the first pattern, the LV shows diffuse, marked fibrosis, which appears as an opaque, white–grey, firm covering involving substantial portions of the left ventricular cavity. In the second pattern, large trabecular or irregular broad bands are observed bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum (VS) and often causing fixed stenosis or a fibrotic tube in the mid to apical left ventricular chamber. This is the most common form reported in cats with endomyocardial RCM (Fox, 2004).\", \"The aetiology of endomyocardial RCM in cats is unknown, but is thought to be multifactorial, as there is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and pathological phenotypes (Fox, 2004). Possible hypotheses include viral or immune-mediated endomyocarditis followed by reparative fibrosis, or a consequence of the end stage of myocardial failure and infarction from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Fox, 1999, Fox, 2004).\", \"The present report provides a fuller description of the range of pathological features in the endomyocardial form of RCM and presents a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of this disease in the cat.\", \"As described in our previous report (Kimura et al., 2016), the materials for the present study were obtained from consecutive feline necropsy examinations conducted at the Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Oncology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan, during the period 2005–2014. A total of 327 necropsy examinations were performed on cats with heart disease, and 41 cats were diagnosed as having the endomyocardial form of RCM. In these cases, the diagnosis was based on characteristic gross features of marked fibrosis focally or diffusely involving the endocardium of the LV. The hallmark gross findings included an enlarged heart with marked left atrial and often right atrial dilation and hypertrophy; severe and extensive endocardial fibrosis, frequently bridging the left ventricular free wall and VS; left ventricular hypertrophy commonly associated with wall and chamber deformity; and mural thrombi in the left atrium (LA) or LV (Fox, 1999, Fox, 2004).\", \"A complete necropsy examination was performed on all 41 cats within 12 h of death. The hearts were examined and weighed, and the heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) was calculated (i.e. HW in g/BW in kg). The hearts were then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 5 days. After fixation, the ventricles were sliced transversely into serial sections approximately 5 mm thick, from the mitral valve to the cardiac apex. Each transverse ventricular slice was embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Selected sections were also stained with Masson's trichrome for collagen fibres, elastic van Gieson for elastic fibres and alcian blue (pH 2.5) and toluidine blue for acidic glycosaminoglycans. The microscopical examination focused on any morphological changes in the endocardium of the LV.\", \"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for identification of the endothelial marker CD34 (mouse monoclonal anti-human CD34 class II, Clone QBEnd-10; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), vimentin (mouse monoclonal antibody against vimentin, clone Vim 3B4; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; mouse monoclonal antibody against human smooth muscle actin, clone 1A4; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), caldesmon (mouse monoclonal antibody against human caldesmon, clone h-CD; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; rabbit polyclonal antibody against PDGF BB; 1 in 50 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; rabbit polyclonal antibody against TGF-β; 1 in 100 dilution; Abcam) in the endocardium of the LV. The avidin–biotin–peroxidase method (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) was employed in order to identify the reaction product, with haematoxylin as a counterstain.\", \"Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine whether viral nucleic acids were detectable in cardiac tissues including the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. DNA and RNA samples were extracted from wax-embedded tissue blocks of 14 cat hearts with endomyocardial RCM collected between 2012 and 2014 using the RecoverAll™ Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). Screening for a total of six viruses, including feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), was carried out according to their prevalence, and the feline β-actin gene (ACTB) was selected as a positive control. Primer pairs and TaqMan probes labelled with the reporter dye FAM at the 5′ end and fluorescent dye TAMRA at the 3′ end for FHV, FPLV, FIV and FeLV were designed on the basis of the published sequences (Dieter et al., 1999, Vögtlin et al., 2002, Ravi et al., 2005, André et al., 2013). New primer–probe sets for FCV, FCoV and ACTB were designed to amplify the conserved region of each genome using PrimeQuest™ software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa, USA). All primer sequences, target gene names and Genbank accession numbers are listed in Table 1\\n. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using a LightCycler® Nano (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and a one-step PrimeScript™ RT-PCR kit (TAKARA Biotech, Shiga, Japan). Nuclease-free water was used for negative controls in each run. The thermal cycling conditions were the same as those described previously (Tsuchiaka et al., 2016).\", \"Macroscopically, although some overlap was evident between them, two types of fibrotic lesion were observed in the endocardium of the LV. Most commonly, patchy endocardial lesions occurred as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen from the free wall to the septum (‘patchy’ pattern; n = 34) (Fig. 1\\nA). The fibrous bands were usually located between the anterior and/or posterior papillary muscles (PMs) and the VS, frequently causing intraventricular partial obstruction and/or chamber deformity at different levels. Less commonly, the left ventricular endocardium showed diffuse and marked fibrosis, which appeared as a white–grey, smooth, firm and uniform covering over the inflow and outflow tracts, PMs, mitral valve apparatus and, occasionally, the aortic valves and trunk (‘diffuse’ pattern; n = 7) (Fig. 1B). In this type, extensive fibrosis caused a moderate to marked reduction of left ventricular chamber size. The mitral valve apparatus and PMs were distorted and fused to surrounding structures.\", \"Heart weights in the cats with endomyocardial RCM (HW/BW 6.0 ± 1.1 g/kg [mean ± SD]) were greater than those in cats with normal hearts (4.0 ± 0.3 g/kg; Liu and Tilley, 1980). The LA and its auricular appendage were markedly enlarged, often with apparent wall thickening. Mural thrombi occurred in the LA, left auricle or LV and were found in 29.3% of the affected cats. In addition, distal aortic thromboembolism was observed in 43.9% of cases.\", \"Histologically, the endocardium of the LV was thickened by proliferation of hyaline and/or fibrous tissue in all 41 cases, regardless of the macroscopic pattern of endocardial thickening. The endocardial lesions were divided into three main histological types, although some cases with intermediate features were observed.\", \"In three of the 41 cases, the thickened endocardium was covered by intact endothelial cells and contained a large number of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by various amounts of alcian blue-positive ground substance with delicate collagen fibrils (type 1) (Fig. 2\\nA). These mesenchymal cells had large oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli, faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm and poorly defined cell margins, and were randomly arranged.\", \"In the second type (type 2), which accounted for 19 of the 41 cases, the endocardial thickening revealed a two-layer structure (i.e. superficial and deep layers; Fig. 2B). These two layers were sometimes ill-defined, and there was some variation, even within the same chamber. The superficial layer consisted of polymorphic mesenchymal cells and a large amount of alcian blue-positive ground substance intermixed with delicate collagen fibrils. Some cells in this area were round to polygonal, had a metachromatic capsule when stained with toluidine blue, and sometimes were located within lacunae, showing chondrogenic differentiation. The deep layer was composed of densely arranged collagen fibres with frequently elongated mesenchymal cells. These cells had fusiform nuclei arranged in a uniform wavy pattern.\", \"The third type (type 3) accounted for the other 19 cases. This type of lesion consisted of thick collagen fibres with sparse elastic fibres, occasionally containing foci of chondroid metaplasia (Fig. 2C). The mesenchymal cells interspersed among bundles of mature collagen fibres were oriented predominantly with their long axis parallel to the endocardial surface. These cells were similar in appearance to those seen in the deep layer of type 2 lesions, but were slightly less numerous.\", \"Cats with type 1 lesions were young, with a mean age at death of 1.8 years (range = 0.3–3.0 years; SD = 1.4), while cats with type 2 and 3 lesions were usually older, with mean ages at death of 5.5 years (range = 2–11 years; SD = 2.6) and 10.2 years (range = 3–19 years; SD = 5.2), respectively. There were significant differences in the age at death among the three types (one-way analysis of variance; P <0.001).\", \"In the endocardial lesions showing a diffuse pattern, the line between the thickened endocardium and the underlying myocardium was usually well defined. There were no inflammatory cells in the endocardium or the myocardium, and there was no evidence of myocardial degeneration, necrosis or fibrosis (Fig. 2). In some cases, however, fibrous tissue of the endocardium extended for various distances into the myocardium, accompanying mild to moderate atrophy of myocardial fibres.\", \"In the endocardial lesions showing a patchy pattern, trabecular or broad bands of fibrous tissue always included multiple left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs), which were composed of central Purkinje fibres and surrounding collagen fibres. In lesions showing this pattern, mesenchymal cells derived from pre-existing LVFTs had proliferated vigorously, showing a characteristic concentric circular pattern centering on the LVFTs. These cells produced a large amount of alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils (type 1), resulting in fusion of the markedly thickened LVFTs (Fig. 3\\nA). The cellular fibrous tissue then matured into densely arranged collagenous connective tissue (type 2) (Fig. 3B), and eventually comprised a large mass of fibrous scar tissue (type 3) (Fig. 3C). Also in this lesion pattern, no distinct inflammatory changes were evident.\", \"In all 41 cases, positive labelling for CD34 was limited to the surface cells of the thickened endocardium and the capillary-like channel-lining cells. The stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells embedded within the fibrous connective tissue were diffusely positive for vimentin, as well as α-smooth muscle actin and caldesmon, although a small proportion of the cells were not labelled for either of the latter markers (Fig. 4\\nA, B). PDGF and TGF-β were present frequently on the cell surface and in the surrounding fibrous connective tissue, especially in type 1 and 2 lesions (Figs. 4C, D).\", \"None of the viral genomes tested were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality, while the ACTB genome was detected in all samples.\", \"The endomyocardial form of RCM in cats was first described in 1970 by Liu, who reported a retrospective series of 68 cases of focal endocardial and myocardial fibrosis in the LV as ‘acquired cardiac lesions leading to congestive heart failure’. Thereafter, the clinical and morphological features of the abnormality were assessed systematically and reported as a distinct disease entity in 1980 by Liu and Tilley. In 2004, Fox reported the first comprehensive description of the disease. Since then, no additional pathological studies of the aetiology of feline endomyocardial RCM have been reported.\", \"In the present study, the endocardial lesions were classified into three types according to their histological composition and structure. Type 1 lesions were found only in young cats aged between 4 months and 3 years, while type 2 and 3 lesions were observed predominantly in middle-aged and older cats, respectively. In addition, the number of cat hearts with type 1 lesions was much lower than the number with type 2 and 3 lesions. Considering the degree of fibrous tissue maturation in each lesion type, it is very likely that the type 1 lesion is an early form of this abnormality, which usually progresses to the more mature type 2 and 3 forms with age. The gradations of the endocardial lesions, the presence of intermediate cases, and the age relationship appear to indicate that the endomyocardial form of feline RCM develops after birth and progresses gradually with age. The fact that no reports appear to have documented the disease in newborn kittens lends further support to this idea.\", \"In the immunohistochemical study, the mesenchymal cells embedded within fibrous connective tissue showed a positive reaction with antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin and caldesmon, indicating a tendency for smooth muscle differentiation; however, undifferentiated cells best classified as primitive mesenchymal cells were also present. In this connection, it is of interest that the subendocardial layer originally contains smooth muscle cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, especially in the left ventricular septal region and the LA (John et al., 2001). Furthermore, the presence of PDGF and TGF-β was confirmed immunohistochemically. It is well known that these growth factors regulate the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and their synthesis of extracellular matrix, leading to the development of arteriosclerotic intimal lesions (Gotlieb and Silver, 2001). Therefore, it is considered that the proliferation of pre-existing mesenchymal cells, which are capable of undergoing smooth muscle differentiation, cause or contribute to the formation of endocardial lesions in the endomyocardial form of feline RCM.\", \"Macroscopically, patchy endocardial thickening was the most common pattern of endomyocardial RCM in cats, as reported previously (Fox, 2004). The patchy lesions appeared as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen, usually from the anterior and/or posterior PMs to the VS. Histologically, the fibrous bands invariably included multiple LVFTs around which mesenchymal cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils. These observations suggest that LVFTs provide a framework for the formation of fibrous bands, and it is noteworthy that a pathological condition associated with abnormal diffuse networks of LVFTs (referred to as ‘excessive moderator bands’) has been reported in 21 cats with heart failure (Liu et al., 1982). The increased numbers of LVFTs most commonly connected the posterior PM or the anterior PM to the VS, showing arrangement patterns similar to those of the trabecular or broad bands observed in the present study. Considering that multiple LVFTs were embedded within the fibrous bands, it is possible that excessive LVFTs are closely related to the occurrence of this type of RCM. Ferasin (2009) believes that ‘excessive moderator bands’ or ‘moderator band cardiomyopathy’ are simply lesions associated with endomyocardial RCM.\", \"The aetiology of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM remains unresolved; however, it has been suggested that endomyocardial damage followed by reparative fibrosis might be associated with viral or immune-mediated endomyocarditis (Fox, 2004). Endomyocarditis of undetermined origin has been described as an important disease of cats since the early 1970s (Liu, 1970, Stalis et al., 1995). In addition, parvoviral genomic material has been isolated from a small number of feline hearts with cardiomyopathy (including RCM) and myocarditis, although cause and effect has not been established (Meurs et al., 2000). In the present study, histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases. Furthermore, our molecular biological observations using real-time PCR detected no viral genomes in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality. These findings suggest that any relationship between a virus-induced inflammatory response and the occurrence of feline RCM is unlikely, but do not necessarily rule out this possibility because the present molecular biological study was limited by its small sample size, the localization of viral genomes within the heart and technical factors associated with real-time PCR. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether an immune-mediated pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of endocardial or endomyocardial inflammation, and further studies will be required in order to address this issue.\", \"The present observations confirm and extend the findings of previous studies and lead to the following conclusions. Firstly, patchy and diffuse patterns of endocardial thickening are evident macroscopically in the LV, the former being much more common. Secondly, from a histological viewpoint, stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells proliferate vigorously in the endocardium, producing alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; these cells are thought to contribute to endocardial lesion formation. Thirdly, from an immunohistochemical viewpoint, the mesenchymal cells embedded within fibrous connective tissue show a tendency for smooth muscle differentiation. Fourthly, in lesions with a patchy pattern, multiple LVFTs are invariably included within large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue, providing a framework for the formation of the fibrous bands. Finally, the lack of any histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis and the absence of candidate viral genomes in cardiac tissue suggest that the occurrence of feline RCM is not significantly related to a virus-induced inflammatory response.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,0\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,1\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,2\": \"problem\",\n

(which was not certified by peer review)\", 'The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a disruptive event for most healthcare systems across the globe. It has led governments to take both public measures for population containment and often a resetting of healthcare organization in order to be able to absorb the peak of patients in particular for critical care. Since the inception of the outbreak, all stakeholders seemed keen to access to reliable and \"living\" information regarding the evolution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths in their countries as well as in others. Crossareas comparisons were made to understand some characteristics of this novel epidemic. [1, 2] Also, being able to predict at least in the short term, the evolution of the main outcome indicators has been a relentless objective of care providers and decision makers. A single tool providing such an aid would be likely to respectively inform people and enlighten relevant stakeholders to anticipate the needed measures, in particular regarding the steering of care and social measures. We therefore developed an online model, intended to be freely accessible to the community.', \"The aim of this study was to report the development of the model as well as some representative data demonstrating its workability and suggesting its accuracy in studying different countries.\", \"We built a SIR-type compartmental model for the Covid-19 data provided by the Johns-\", \"University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series).

A classical SIR model considers 3 types of individuals: susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals (I) and recovered individuals (R). [4] Many extensions to this model have been proposed, in particular by adding a compartment of exposed but noncontagious individuals (E) to the model. [5] Other models distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, between patients admitted to intensive care units and patients admitted to regular hospital. [6] [7] [8] The more complex these models are, the more parameters they depend on. A classical method then consists of fixing the value of some of these parameters to values found in the literature and varying the other parameters in order to obtain simulations with dynamics that are similar to those of the data. The main objective of these approaches is not to adjust data, but rather to develop a model that is supposed to represent the reality as closely as possible. Our approach was different: our main objective was to develop an epidemiological model that fits the observed data as closely as possible, while at the same time being as simple as possible.\", \"However, we did not aim to develop an empirical model that looks like the data (e.g. using a polynomial model): the model and its parameters must have a real epidemiological interpretation, in terms of transition from one state to another or length of stay in a state. On the one hand, we made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size, which is realistic as the latest studies suggest an infection rate of around 5% in several countries.\", \"[9] This hypothesis allowed us to ignore the compartments S of the model. On the other hand, we had to take into account the fact that not all patients were cured but that a certain proportion may die. We therefore introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients.\", \"As an examination of the data at first glance showed that there was a delay between new infections and deaths, we therefore added an additional compartment L in the model, which .

(Figure 1) A fundamental parameter of the model is the transmission rate, which indicates how quickly people become infected and become contagious themselves. Our model integrates a timedependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by the country in question. One can thus imagine that the transmission rate was stable -and possibly high -before lockdown and then decreased with lockdown in countries that have adopted such a measure. A piecewise linear model was used for the transmission rate to take into account these possible variations. As the number of segments and the location of the changes in the slope are unknown, they were estimated together with the model parameters.\", \"The data available for each country are the daily number of confirmed cases (bearing in mind that it is a number that represents an unknown fraction of the true total number of cases) and the daily number of deaths.\", \"A periodic weekly component appears in each of these series, for many countries. This component is of course not related to the dynamics of the epidemic, which has no scientific reason to change across the days of the week, but rather to the way in which the numbers of cases and deaths are counted and reported, which can change from day to day.

unprecedented rage in most parts of the globe, overwhelming the healthcare facilities, locking down cities, hitting hard the economy [1, 2] . Within the first four months from the very first report from the city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019 [1, 3] , the epidemic has already reached more than 200 countries, in all the inhabited continents, infecting more nearly 2.5 million people globally [4] . The death toll is already touching the sky at a devastating pace [4] .\", \"Such pandemics, however, are not new in recent times: The 1918 Spanish flu resulted in 50-100 million deaths throughout the globe [5, 6] . In recent years, similar coronavirus outbreak happened in 2003 (SERS-Cov) [7] and 2012 (MERS) [8] killing around a thousand people in China and the Middle east. Following that the outbreak of Ebola cost more than ten thousand lives in Africa [9] . After resulting in massacres in Europe, the pandemic has turned its head towards the United States where more than half of a million people have already been infected within a short span [10] . The complexity in understanding and estimating the spatial spread of the pandemic lies in the conflicting numbers of the rates at which the virus is transmitted to the neighbourhood [11] . Specifically, when multiple hotspots coexist together, only a few recursive events of local transmission turn into a catastrophic avalanche with dramatically increasing number of infections in a very short time window [12] . Moreover, the adaptability of the virus in ever-changing environments is also surprising [13] . Thus, identification of the true character and the self-organization of the epidemic has emerged as one of the biggest global challenges in human history. This is pivotal to develop non-pharmaceutical antidotes with sophisticated intervention strategies to control the dispersal of the pandemic until some clinical solutions arrive in support [14] .\", \"Indeed, there are many major challenges in predicting the spatial spread in a country having multiple epicentres of human transmission, using phenomenologi-cal models [15] . Since an effective model requires the prior knowledge of transmission and recovery rates, it is almost impossible to estimate them in the midway of an epidemic, for the rates depend on the nature of instantaneous social preparedness that vary locally. For instance, Germany had three major infected regions, Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia which had roughly twenty thousand cases in each of these federal states on average by the first week of April [16] . In contrast, the other neighbouring states, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Hesse had surprisingly smaller numbers [16] . This situation is significantly different from Hubei that alone had more than eighty percent of the total cases in China [17] .\", '\"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful\" [18] . Here, we address the dynamics in an epidemic using a model of interacting hotspots. We consider a model state consisting of multiple cities that exchange infected populations pair-wise stochastically where the local dynamics in the individual cities are governed by the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with instantaneously or regularly updated populations. Moreover, the order of the random exchange of the infected populations is controlled by a connectivity parameter. We show that tuning the connectivity parameter, it is possible to control the cooperativity of the infection propagation. However, the heterogeneity in the cooperativity determines controls over the outbreak. We validate the qualitative features of the model with the data of the heterogeneous evolution of COVID-19 in different provinces of Germany. We discuss further possibilities of development.', \"We consider model dynamics in a state consisting of different cities that are allowed to exchange populations among themselves. The population exchange is subject to a containment measure modelled via a connectivity parameter which is assumed to be a constant and identical for all cities. M such interacting cities are considered with initial total populations N i being the sum of the Susceptible (S i ), Infected (I i ) and Recovered (R i ) arXiv:2004.12799v1 [physics.soc-ph] 24 Apr 2020 populations in a city i. For simplicity, the exchange process uses the criteria of classic random exchange of econophysics [19] . During an exchange each of two cities retains an identical fraction of population η and redistributes a random fraction of the infected population pair-wise. The interactions between a pair of cities (i and j) with infected population I i and I j are governed by the exchange rules :\", \"with\", \"The process also ensures the conservation: N i + N j =Ñ i +Ñ j during the exchange processes. However. after t = 0, the model does not use any restrictions to enforce any conservation in the global population. Here, f R is the random fraction (taken as a uniform deviate between 0 and 1) and η is the connectivity parameter. The parameter serves in the same way as the saving propensity does in the context of econophysics models [19] . Now in the city, i, the time dependent population, N i is sum of instantaneous updated susceptible(S i ), infected(Ĩ i ) and recovered (R i ) populations following the SIR equations of motions [15] :\", \"We consider M 2 number of stochastic random exchanges using Eq. (3) (4) between the cities before we update populations using Eqs. (5-7) (See numerical scheme in the Supplementary Information(SI), SI Note.1 ) in each time step. The number of exchanges are optimised in order to ensure significant amount of exchange of infected population among the cities that drives the process. In each of the time steps, we now solve 3M number of coupled differential equations alongside M 2 [20] number of random exchanges to extract the dynamics. We use the time step δt = 1 for the integration throughout the calculation.\", \"We monitor the dynamics of such a state consisting of M = 64, 1024 and 4096 cities with identical initial population (N i = 1 at t = 0) for different ranges of magnitudes of connectivity parameter, η. Here N i , S i , I i , R i represent the fraction of the total population in the state M . Each city has identical initial infected population as I i (0) = 0.0001 [21] . The initial conditions make sure that every city has identical behaviour for η = 1 when the cities are made isolated by some intervention protocol as, for η = 1, the cities retain all the population and does not actively take part in the exchanges. In contrast, they exchange freely for η = 0.\", \"In Fig. 1 , we show the dynamics of the infected (I) and recovered (R) population in the state with M = 64 for η = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0. For η = 1.0, the cities are isolated completely. Hence, the behavior of the individual cities are identical to the solutions of SIR equations for a case with identical parameters (See SI Note:2 and SI Fig. 1 ). For β = 0.5 and γ = 0.3333, the peak in I appears at t ≈ 50 with a peak height I P = 0.06 while S and R saturates to steady values S S ≈ 0.45 and R S ≈ 0.55 respectively beyond t ≈ 80. This we also see in the upper panels in Fig. 1 for η = 1.0. The peaks in I also appear simultaneously for all the cities t ≈ 50.\", \"For η < 1, as the exchanges of the infected fraction between the cities set in, the behavioural differences in the cities become prominent. In the middle panels of Fig. 1 , we show the evolution of Infected and Recovered population for η = 0.5. We see heterogeneity in the infection propagation: Not only the peaks appear in different times in the different cities, but also the height of the peaks in I i become distinct for each city. The dynamic equilibrium is attained when I i → 0 for all i simultaneously at sufficiently long time after the individual peaks in the infected populations in the cities are observed. These effects become more prominent for lower η. For η = 0, the exchange is completely uncontrolled as individual cities do not have any restriction in retaining the fraction of infected population. Hence, the distributions of both I and R become more diffused as shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 1 . Now for all these cases, we look at the time evolution of the probability distribution of the infected populations, P (I; t) with increasing t. In Fig. 2 , we show the evolution of P (I; t) for different cases of η. As there is a tiny population of infected population in the beginning due to the initial condition, the distribution at t = 0, P (I; 0) ≈ δ(I(0)) for all values of η. For η = 1, as individual cities show a peak at t ≈ 50, the delta peak of P (I) also shifts to higher values of I (Fig. 2.(a.2) ). Since all the cities behave identically for η = 1, there is no spread in the distributions for all t. At higher t when the infected population → 0, the distribution again shifts to smaller values of I( Fig.2(a.3) ).\", \"The situation changes for any η < 1 as the exchanges bring broadening in P (I; t), specifically at t → 50. For η = 0.5, there is a significant broadening in P (I) for 40 < t < 60 [ Fig.2(b) ]. The nature of the tail in P (I) albeit changes with t. We even observe a shift in the mode of the peak in P i [Figs. 2(b.1) and 2(b.2) ]. The length of the tail decreases [ Fig. 2(b. 3)] and disappears at higher t. For η = 0 [ Fig.2(c) ], the broadening in the distributions is more prominent, even at intermediate t[ Fig.2(c.1) ]. At t ≈ 50, the tail in P (I) exists upto I ≈ 0.375. It affirms that there is finite probability to have cities with extremely large proportion of the infected populations of the order of I ≈ 0.375 which is almost 37.5 percent of the total population [ Fig.2(c.2) ]. With increasing t, the tail decreases in I and the peak reaches ≈ 0 as the epidemic mitigates around t ≈ 75.\", \"In order to understand the role of heterogeneity in the infection propagation, we now focus on the behaviour of the moments of P (I) for different values of the connectivity index, η, at different t [ Fig. 3 ]. The mean of P (I), µ = IP (I)dI is shown in Fig. 3(a) . The behaviour of µ doesn't show much heterogeneity, suggesting that the collective peak appears almost at similar times as for individual cities. This doesn't change much as η is varied. However, the height of the collective peak decrease for smaller η around t ≈ 50. The variance of P (I), σ 2 (t) =< I(t) > 2 − < I 2 (t) > show interesting pattern for t ≈ 50 [ Fig. 3(b) ] as η is varied. Quite naturally, σ 2 (t) → 0 for η → 1. As η is decreased, the cooperativity also decreases due to increasingly larger disorder. For small η and η = 0, σ 2 (t) show prominent non-monotonic behaviour with increasing t. However, the non-monotonic dependence vanishes as η → 1.\", \"The shift in µ occurs due to the simultaneous increase in the infected populations while the peak in σ 2 is due to distinct behaviours of the cities. We now look at the behaviour of σ/µ that captures the competition between the two factors. In Fig. 4(a) , we show the phase diagram of σ/µ. σ/µ has prominent non-monotonic dependence near t ≈ 50 for smaller values of η. The peak defines the timescale of heterogeneity in the collective infection \", \"We now attempt to understand the COVID-19 data of the cases in different provinces of Germany using the insights of the model. The time series data for Germany for all 16 provinces are shown in Supplementary Information (SI Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . We now analyse the behaviour of σ/µ computed from the distribution of the infected populations in provinces of Germany (See SI Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . We see σ/µ has a sharp peak on 23rd March, 2020. In order to verify the heterogeneity, we further look at the dynamic statistical correlation between the daily new cases in the different provinces for the successive days, using the Pearson correlation between the distribution of the infected populations at all the provinces in time t and t + 1, given by ρ(t, t + 1) = cov[P (I; t), P (I; t + 1)] σ(t)σ(t + 1)\", \"We show the dynamic statistical correlation, ρ(t, t + 1) between the number of cases on successive days from all the federal states of Germany in Fig. 5 . We avoid the double count in the data. The trend in the statistical correlation behaves non-monotonically in the period, with a dip on 23rd March when the peak in σ µ appeared, reiter- ating the effect of heterogeneity due to lack of dynamical statistical correlation. Surprisingly, the date exactly matches the date of the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. From the first week of April, there is a clear trend of flattening of the curve with significantly smaller number of cases with respect to the maximum numbers recorded on 27th March. Always, there are continuous exchanges of populations between the provinces in a country unless any intervention is imposed. The mobility between the cities without restriction, in principle resembles the η = 0 case of the model while the situation with strict intervention behaves as η = 1 case of the model when the cities are considered isolated. Considering time dependence in η, it is possible to realize a dynamic picture from pre to post lockdown situations. The behaviour of σ/µ qualitatively features the balance between the spread of the infection in the cities and the relative change in the collective spread of the epidemic in the state. The extremum in σ/µ captures the extreme heterogeneity in the infection propagation as it optimize the relative balance between the local spread and drive in the collective transmission. On this note, the model that we use delivers the similar qualitative feature of the data of COVID-19 cases in the states of Germany.\", \"Whether the appearance of the peak in heterogeneity is a universal confirmatory signature of containment, can be confirmed only by further studies. There are many possible ways to develop the minimalistic model. It is possible to include time dependence in the parameters. Random deviates of a different kind can also be tested for modelling specific situations. Also, possibilities of further customization needs system specific details and the set of governing equations where specific rules of death, quarantine or hospitalization counts could be considered in addition. Further, it would be challenging to model the transportation of the infected populations using deterministic equations [22] , vis-a-vis the data driven approaches [23, 24] . On this note, we believe, that this study, opens up horizons in exploring the rich dynamics of infection propagation inluding sophisticated intervention among the interacting hotspots.\", \"The author is indebted to D.

means it can be transmitted across species boundaries from its natural host (flying foxes or fruit bats) to cause infection and disease in domestic animals and people. Emerging bat-borne infections such as Hendra are a pressing global public health concern (Wong, Lau, Woo, & Yuen, 2007). Hendra is highly lethal to humans and endemic in Australian flying fox populations. Like other new and re-emerging infectious diseases, changes in the incidence and cross-species transmissibility of Hendra are likely to hinge on the ecological impacts of natural events and human activities (Jones et al., 2008). Indeed it is clear that Hendra has ‘spilled’ over from flying fox populations into horses, and then people and pet dogs through their increasingly intense interaction in rural and peri-urban areas. Importantly, the impacts of these interactions are bi-directional; anything that induces ‘stress’ in flying foxes is thought to amplify viral shedding into the environment (Parrish et al., 2008). Efforts to disrupt flying-fox encroachment on human settlement, therefore, are likely to increase the risk of human infection. Current hopes of prevention rest on the development of a vaccine for horses, the only confirmed intermediate host for Hendra transmission to humans. In the interim, public health responses to Hendra have focussed on education and behaviour modification amongst high-risk groups such as veterinarians, horse owners and people who work in equine industries, and the institution of disease surveillance and quarantine measures involving both human and animal health sectors (Adamson, Marich, & Roth, 2011).\", \"Since Hendra virus first emerged in 1994 there have only been four human deaths and seven human infections. However concerns in Australia about the risks to human health escalated sharply in 2011 when outbreaks in horses occurred over a greater geographic area and at a far higher frequency than past ‘Hendra seasons’ (Field, Crameri, Kung, & Wang, 2012). Concern about the risks posed by the bat-borne virus were further heightened by the subsequent and unexpected discovery of a pet dog with a naturally acquired infection (Tapim & Withey, 2011).\", \"Many Australians, particularly those living in regional areas, already consider flying foxes to be a noisy and unhygienic pest. Towns and city suburbs in north-eastern parts of the country can find themselves ‘under siege’ from large groups of roosting ‘fruit bats’ – with these ‘camps’ or colonies sometimes comprised of several thousand individuals. Aside from the impacts of noise and faeces, flying fox colonies can ‘fly in and feed’ on commercial orchards causing significant economic losses for fruit growers. For this reason there has been a longstanding practice of shooting flying foxes and disrupting their colonies with sirens, smoke bombs and helicopters to deter them from congregating in agricultural and residential areas.\", \"Whereas in the past diseases of wild animals were thought to pose limited risk to humans, the connection between human activity – particularly changes in land use – and changes in patterns of infectious disease is becoming increasingly clear (Newell et al., 2005). The urbanisation of coastal habitats is thought to have had a number of effects on flying fox populations in eastern Australia – restricting access to their normal foods and forcing them to both turn to, and increasingly rely on, commercial orchards and urban gardens for sustenance (Plowright et al., 2008). And because food is scarce flying foxes are also less inclined to migrate, leading to the formation of permanent camps in agricultural and residential areas. These effects are also exacerbated by natural events that further limit the availability of natural and horticultural food resources, such as cyclones and floods (Plowright et al., 2011). As large groups of flying foxes congregate in and around human settlements this gives the impression that the population is thriving, whereas this is more a result of reduction in their natural habitat, and several species of flying foxes are, in fact, vulnerable to extinction (Welbergen, Klose, Markus, & Eby, 2008).\", \"For this reason, since 1986 in NSW and 1994 in Queensland, flying foxes camps have been legally protected from human interference to try and rehabilitate the population. In 2008 the Queensland government took the further step of refusing all applications by farmers for permits to shoot flying foxes to protect their crops, both on ecological grounds and because attempts to break up established camps may be counterproductive. It was argued that any measures that stressed flying foxes would increase the risk of Hendra spilling over into horses; and dispersing specific camps would likely be ineffective as there would be nothing to stop the colony re-establishing itself nearby, and once again in conflict with human settlement. Thus, what was designed to be legislation to protect a vulnerable species of native animal became a policy instrument with which to try and limit zoonotic risk exposure. This transition from conservation-focussed environmental policy to public health policy has been incremental, such that the policy aim was not to solve either problem but manage areas of emerging concern. Yet as people directly affected by flying foxes have struggled to ‘live with’ the growing throngs of unwelcome neighbours, many have come to believe that by protecting flying fox populations and advocating the adoption of low risk behaviours towards them, governments and health authorities have put the health and welfare of another species above that of human populations.\", \"Experiences with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) indicate that policy-making for a new zoonotic disease is always difficult and prone to polarising different stakeholders in affected communities (Phillips, Bridgeman, & Ferguson-Smith, 2000; Singer et al., 2003). A key feature in matters surrounding animal disease control is that radically different policy responses – such as wholesale culling or vaccination – can typically be presented as plausible points of intervention. For this reason decisions surrounding what should be done about new or pressing zoonotic risks are often contested, and finding the right balance between over-caution, laissez-faire approaches, and determining the weight given to different socioeconomic factors can be difficult. For example a lack of due diligence can expose the population to the risk of infection for far longer than necessary, as was the case with BSE. Conversely, the overzealous application of the precautionary principle can destroy the livelihood of a population, impact its food supply, limit development, and entrench or exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantage (World Health Organization, 2004). Furthermore, when the zoonotic risk is new, attempts to explain the choice of policy are likely to be further complicated by uncertainty regarding the precise risk of infection, the drivers of disease emergence, and the measures needed to control the risk of infection. Therefore public support for policies that disrupt people's lives and communities or place precautionary limits on the development of natural resources might depend on their understanding of the causes and risks of zoonotic outbreaks, their trust in government agencies, and the likely consequences for them of different public health responses.\", \"In this regard news media are an important source of information for the public (Brodie, Hamel, Altman, Blendon, & Benson, 2003), particularly with regard to the complex relationship between the environment and human health and with regards to the risk posed by animals. For not only does the media reflect the issues that concern people, it also impacts upon the issues the public thinks about, and the criteria through which they think about them – influencing people's understanding of what is at stake, of who or what is to blame, of who is at risk, and of what can be done to address the situation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 2000). In this regard, while individual journalists my privilege independence, accuracy and balance, media organisations are rarely neutral and can both influence public opinion themselves, or be used by industry, politicians and interests groups to influence public perception of particular issues and/or promote their own ends (Callaghan & Schnell, 2001; Terkildsen, Schnell, & Ling, 1998). Therefore the effects of how the media chooses to raise to public prominence and then ‘frame’ events and opinions surrounding a new health issue such as an emerging zoonosis can be recursive. For example because elected officials, politicians and policy advisors are responsive to public opinion, public perceptions about the causes of a disease threat like Hendra virus might influence the level of public support for specific health policies, and, thereby, ongoing political debate (Gollust, Lantz, & Ubel, 2009; Harrabin, Coote, & Allen, 2003).\", \"In this paper we analyse representations in the Australian media of the causes and consequences of the emergence of Hendra as a zoonotic risk, focussing on how the unavoidable uncertainty about its causes and likely consequences shaped perceptions of the health policies put in place in the attempt to mitigate the risk of human infection. In short we seek to examine media representations of an infectious threat within a broader policy context. Because flying foxes are a highly visible, widespread and relatively novel source of infectious risk for humans, the emergence of Hendra virus presents an opportunity to track and compare media representations of disease ‘events’, health policy goals, political discourses and public opinions in ways that are difficult for non-communicable diseases. In this our research is consistent with other reports examining media portrayals of the health risk and scientific and policy uncertainty associated with contested environmental exposures (Mayer, 2012) and Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) (Daku, Gibbs, & Heymann, 2012; Hilton & Hunt, 2011; Washer, 2010).\", \"To identify Australian media coverage of issues surrounding the emergence of Hendra virus, the database Factiva was searched using the following terms as textwords: (Hendra virus) or (flying fox*) or (fruit bat*) for the period 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2011. A News Filter limiting content to the region of Australia was then applied identifying more than 10,000 items. Because we were focussing on representations of Hendra and associated public policy, further Subject Filters were applied to restrict the sample to Political and General News, limiting the corpus to just over 6000 articles. Full-text reports from 9 news media sources from areas affected by Hendra virus outbreaks were then downloaded. The sample includes 2 national media organizations [N] as well as articles appearing in the 3 major provincial [P] newspapers and 4 of the 103 local [L] newspapers in Queensland and New South Wales. They are: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online News Service [N]; The Australian Newspaper [N]; The Courier Mail [P]; The Daily Telegraph [P]; The NewsMail (Bundaberg) [L]; Sunshine Coast Daily [L]; Sydney Morning Herald [P]; Townsville Bulletin [L]; and, The Warwick Daily News [L]. Pretesting confirmed that this search strategy would produce a larger and more heterogeneous sample of news reports, while still including coverage that focussed more narrowly on specific zoonotic events. From the resulting corpus of 1383 articles we discarded 43 duplicates and 356 reports that were not immediately relevant to Hendra virus or flying fox populations (such as those that refer to the zip-line apparatus known as a ‘flying-fox’ or businesses or products with ‘flying fox’ in the title), after which 984 unique articles remained to be analysed.\", \"The media sample was then read, catalogued manually, and cross-compared by the lead author in order to identify and track prominent concepts, differences, and themes. Next, both authors manually cross-coded a pilot sample (n = 40) of the media corpus for specific types of content to confirm and to extend the preliminary thematic analysis. Articles then were coded for:•mention of horses, flying foxes/fruit bats or Hendra virus•mention of debates about flying fox control•report of distal ecological causes (loss of natural habitat) for the emergence of Hendra virus or the possibility of viral mutation•mention of ignorance about Hendra virus amongst scientists, healthcare providers or members of the public•reference to government inaction as a factor contributing to the Hendra problem•reference to people's health and welfare not being high enough on the political agenda.\\n\", \"These codes were both emergent and informed by similar media analyses (for example Gollust & Lantz, 2009; Washer, 2004). Because Hendra events tend to occur seasonally (from winter-spring), the calendar year was chosen as the unit of analysis. The results from coding were then tabulated in matrix form, cross referenced and displayed visually as descriptive statistics in charts to aid interpretation. Regular discussions among the authors served to generate additional enquires and to validate insights as they emerged. This approach is consistent with ethnographic content analysis, a qualitative research method for interpreting documents within the context of their use, which enables researchers to generate insights about how documents promote particular ways of understanding, interpreting and responding to an issue or event such as the emergence of a new disease from both numerical and narrative data (Altheide, 1987).\", \"With these concepts and types of content in mind, our analysis of the 984 articles proceeded through several cycles of immersion and crystallization of insights – a research process comprised of repeated readings and comparisons across and between news-sources, discussions amongst the authors, periods of testing of alternate explanations, and then re-immersion within the research materials (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999).\", \"Given that flying foxes were first identified as the natural host of Hendra virus in 1996 (Young et al., 1996) it is surprising to find that until 2011, the media paid little attention to the link between Hendra virus and flying fox populations. In previous years reports about flying foxes tended not to mention Hendra, but focussed on the impact of flying fox populations on horticultural enterprises and residential areas. In these reports first hand testimony and events on the ground were used to framepublic perceptions of this animal's protected status, and the bureaucratic and ‘hands off’ approach of the government agencies to this issue. At the same time reports that are primarily about Hendra virus during this period typically focus on ‘unfolding’ zoonotic outbreaks, suspected cases of Hendra infection, quarantine orders, human exposure and disease, experimental treatments, and the impacts of these incidents on individuals. It is not until the unprecedented number of Hendra outbreaks in 2011 that the relationship between Hendra virus infection and contact with flying foxes becomes an item of sustained interest in our media sample.\", \"In 2011 with 17 zoonotic events across two states, 21 dead horses, and upwards of 70 people potentially exposed to the virus through their dealings with sick and dying animals, discussions about the potential role of flying foxes as Hendra carriers became firmly established as a central part of the media discourse. Although the relative prominence given to different types of nonhuman animal changed across the years sampled. By 2011 news about Hendra virus and flying foxes suddenly began to be described in reference to each other in the majority of news reports (Table 1).\", \"The nonhuman species most often linked to Hendra virus in the media sample was the horse, both as a victim of zoonotic outbreaks and as the intermediate host for human infection (See Fig. 2\\n). As the link between Hendra and flying foxes was given greater prominence in the media, representations of the position and status of flying foxes and horses also began to change. An article in The Sydney Morning Herald in 2009 provides a typical example of the more cautious approach taken in the earlier years sampled:Hendra is not highly contagious but is very often fatal. Carried by fruit bats, it infects horses, which can then transmit the disease to humans through bodily fluids. (Marriner, 2009, p.2)\\n\", \"In this quote flying foxes are identified as the source of the virus and the role of horses as intermediate hosts is well defined, as is the mode of transmission for human infection. At this stage the media are at pains to make it clear that Hendra virus is a fatal and devastating disease of horses that can, on occasion, infect and kill people who work in equine industries. Flying foxes are not portrayed as an immediate or direct risk to human health but as an environmental factor, they are to be understood as the inadvertent reservoir of equine infection.\", \"Although horses continue to be a feature of Hendra news stories, by 2011 it was not uncommon for some subtle distinctions in the natural history of the disease to be dispensed with. Rather than intermediate hosts, horses began to be portrayed as victims of a dangerous ‘bat-borne’ disease; their role as intermediate hosts is implied rather than explicitly stated, as shown by this 2011 report in The Australian:The outbreak of Hendra virus that has killed six horses and exposed 26 people to infection has reached the outskirts of Brisbane and is the most virulent in the known history of the fruit bat-borne disease. (Barrett, 2011a, p.3)\\n\", \"At the same time as the media start to problematize the role of flying foxes in Hendra outbreaks column inches begin to be devoted to identifying the source of each equine case. Reports begin to note forensically significant details, often with direct quotes from the investigating scientists, much in the same way a crime reporter might ask a detective to profile a likely suspect and then “set the scene” of a murder.“The infected horse was grazing in a small paddock containing flowering and fruiting trees, where flying foxes were active.” (“National snapshot: Almost 50 waiting for Hendra results,” 2011, p.14)\\n\", \"These descriptions of ‘place’ resonate closely with public health recommendations given to horse owners to place feeding bins and water troughs under cover and keep their horses out of paddocks with flowering or fruiting trees, if possible. Yet translating this advice into practice sometimes only served to increase people's sense of anxiety and powerlessness, and their anger with the government. For example one property owner in Gayndah told The Courier-Mail:“The head vet of Queensland is saying, ‘Keep your horses away from the bats’. Well, I'm doing that but the bats aren't keeping away from my horses” Mrs Robertson said. “Fifty thousand infected bats are pooping on my horses, their grass and their water every day.” (Robertson & Hall, 2011, p.8)\\n\", \"Public acknowledgement of scientific uncertainty about Hendra virus was also a feature of the media coverage in 2011, heightening the sense that events were out of control (Table 1). In previous years, statements about expert uncertainty were either general reflections about the lack of knowledge of how horses acquired the virus, or they had a sharp clinical focus – describing how little experience health professions had in dealing with human Hendra infections. The former were typically framed as a matter of scientific curiosity, the later a matter of critical urgency that had immediate impact on people's lives.\", \"But during 2011 the media spotlight on Hendra returned to unanswered questions surrounding the health and management of other species. Even as scientists and veterinarians were described as being “baffled” by Hendra virus, they were required to publically speculate on two issues: the implications of finding a pet dog with a naturally acquired infection, and theorise as to why there were so many equine cases that year. That scientists interviewed by the media appeared to be taken aback by the discovery of the canine case drew this response from the Queensland Premier, at the time, Anna Bligh:“The scientists themselves are being very honest with us. They're telling us that science does not fully understand every part of this disease. We, as human beings, have had to cope with that in our past, we've conquered diseases before, I believe we will conquer this one.” (Miles, MacDonald, & Helbig, 2011, p.2)\\n\", \"Throughout the same period members of the public were increasingly portrayed as being forced to deal with the effects and risks of Hendra outbreaks with inadequate information about the disease. Reflecting the statements of the experts, the concerns of the public expressed in the media were, for the most part, articulated around what people should do to protect themselves and their animals from Hendra events, particularly as pet dogs now appeared to catch the disease, and therefore might be a risk to humans. As reports emerged that the infected dog had been destroyed and the media sought to highlight existing scientific literature that showed that dogs, cats and guinea pigs could be infected with the virus under “controlled” laboratory conditions, repeated assurances by health authorities that there was minimal risk of catching Hendra from animals other than horses began to wear thin. With this single canine infection, in the words of one reporter: “the bats’ presence has become all the more sinister”. (MacDonald, 2011, p.5)\", \"Despite increasing attention to the link between Hendra virus and flying fox populations, for the most part media reports of the Hendra outbreak in 2011 infrequently gave any consideration to non-proximal factors for disease emergence. While earlier reports, in 2007 and 2010, regularly pointed to land clearing and environmental events such as prolonged drought, floods and cyclones as explanations for flying foxes congregating in residential and agricultural areas, and approximately one in four articles describe habitat loss as inevitably increasing the risk of Hendra jumping species, there is a clear and precipitous decline in such reports in 2011. Of the 440 reports analysed from 2011, only one in 10 has any mention of these types of ecological drivers for disease emergence or the increasing prevalence of Hendra outbreaks (Table 1). Indeed by 2011 the media focus is almost always on events ‘as they happen’ – the vast majority of reports doing little more than point to the presence of flying foxes and horses in the same locality as the most important characteristic of a causal story of disease or of public health risk.\", \"Finally cross-coding the media sample revealed that issues surrounding the risk of Hendra virus to human health became a dominant feature of reports that specifically address, or at least in some way refer to, the continuing controversy about the control of flying fox populations (Fig. 2). While the frequency with which media reports describe the level of dissatisfaction with the government's policy of flying fox protection remains much the same from 2010 onwards, in 2011 heightened uncertainty about who and what was at risk from Hendra virus increasingly became a factor of some importance to assessments of the Queensland Government's response to the unfolding situation. As the lack of knowledge about Hendra virus became an increasingly prominent feature of debates about what should be done about the encroachment of flying fox populations on human settlement and agriculture, so did assertions in the media by members of the public and politicians that concern for the health and welfare of people affected be flying foxes was being ignored in deference to the interests of another species.\", \"In 2011 key features of the justification for the policy of not moving or culling flying foxes increasingly became contested in the media – particularly the claim that flying fox numbers were in decline and the claim that attempts to disperse flying fox colonies would spread the disease. For those wanting to repeal protective legislation, assertions that flying fox numbers were not falling could be backed up by simple first hand observation. People just had to come to affected areas and look for themselves. What they would find, according to the Mayor of Charters Towers, was:“These bats aren't endangered, they are in plague numbers and more and more communities are feeling the effects of bat infestation.” (Gilham, 2011, p.5)\\n\", \"Proponents of policy change to protect the public against bat-borne diseases also dismissed in the media claims that culling or dispersing flying foxes would spread Hendra virus. Even as the Premier or a government spokespersons re-iterated publically that they would: “respond to the outbreak of Hendra virus on the basis of the best-informed science that we can access” (Barrett, 2011b, p.7), what constituted evidence became a point of contention. Those seeking to remove protections told the media that current policies were based on a set of (unproven or unsound) assumptions. In support of this, scientists themselves, as is their fashion, acknowledged the limits of scientific certainty – noting that they did not know how horses caught the virus, and that they lacked incontestable proof that disrupting bat colonies would lead to its spread – something admitted by the chief veterinarian of Queensland (to the significant discomfort of the previous Labor government). In contrast, politicians supporting the ‘rights’ of land-owners to government protection from flying foxes, such as the independent Member of Parliament, Bob Katter, were able to tell press conferences that fruit bats had been removed from towns for years before the current ban without causing an outbreak. And of claims by scientists, health authorities and government spokesperson that these types of interventions could heighten zoonotic risks, Katter noted in the Townsville Bulletin:“If you were looking for a more stupid claim you couldn’t find it… we’ve got empirical evidence on our side, all they’ve got is conjecture on theirs”. (Galloway, 2011, p.15)\\n\", \"A prominent advocate for bat culling known for his theatrical turn of phrase, one week earlier Katter framed the deeper issues in the following terms in The Courier-Mail:“If it comes to a choice of our children dying or us going out there and killing flying foxes, then I have a very grave moral problem about not going out there and killing the flying foxes,” Mr Katter said. (Miles, Helbig, & Michael, 2011, p.11)\\n\", \"Pointedly, a number of other politicians even claimed that calls by scientist and the government for more research on Hendra was further evidence that current policies put the needs of flying foxes above the health and welfare of ‘real’ people:”Why don’t we, as an immediate first response, reduce flying fox numbers? … Why is the government throwing money at research, which will not protect families now?” (“Hendra virus claims another victim,” 2011, p.3)\\n\", \"The newsworthiness of the Hendra outbreak in 2011 and the growing sense of uncertainty expressed by those charged with managing the situation created a media forum in which previously distinct health and environmental issues related to flying foxes became redefined as one and the same problem. Consequently, even as a large pool of research funding was announced for projects related to protecting people and communities from Hendra virus, this only served to highlight the absence of direct government action.\", \"This research has several limitations. First given our focus on reactions in selected news media to zoonotic events, health communications and public policy, we were not able to capture the nuance that a broader analysis of press releases, policy documents and the grey literature on Hendra virus and flying fox population control would illuminate. Second we did not seek to include the political leanings, funding relationships and commercial affiliations of the news organisations examined in the analysis. In this regard Australia, and especially Queensland, does not have a competitive and diverse media market. Ownership of news media is highly concentrated. Aside from the news provided by the Government funded national broadcaster, the ABC, many major towns and cites are served by only one newspaper. This may have coloured how statements by member of the public, politicians, scientists and other experts were framed and presented in the media. Finally our focus was on Hendra virus in Australia. Without further research it is doubtful our findings can be generalised to the coverage of other bat-borne emergent zoonotic diseases such as Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh or SARs-like corona virus in South-East Asia.\", \"What this study reveals is the extent to which the media can be used to construct the risks of Hendra virus not as a scientific problem but as a moral question; that is, a problem that requires moral solutions. Given that any government measure aimed at protecting public health involves moral judgements that are legitimated through political processes (Leichter, 2003; Oliver, 2006), the infectious risk posed by wild animals to agricultural production and human populations is undoubtedly both a political and a moral issue. But the moral dimensions of this issue, and the development of policy responses to it, are deeply contested and heavily influenced by media representations of the link between human health, animals and the environment. Our findings illustrate the potential for health communications around emerging infectious disease risks to become entangled in other political agendas and conflict with widely held human values, with implications for the public's likelihood of supporting public policy and risk management strategies that require behavioural change or seek to address the ecological drivers of incidence. More broadly, our research illustrates the value of methodologies from the social sciences to expand the relevance of the One World One Health public health agenda to reflect lived realities and the needs of communities.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,0\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,1\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,3\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,4\": \"problem\",\n

deploying its service members throughout nearly every continent in the world. Deployments range from small-scale training missions to politically and militarily significant exercises with worldwide joint and combined operational units. One of the largest combined exercises in the Pacific Command is Thailand\\'s \"Cobra Gold.\" This 2-week multilateral exercise allows engaged military forces to work together in a joint/combined environment to conduct numerous operations on land, at sea, and in the air. The 2003 Cobra Gold exercise included ϳ12,000 troops from participating nations, with 5,200 of those being from the U.S. Armed Forces. The specific focus of the 2003 exercise was to enhance peace enforcement, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief operations. 1 As plans for Cobra Gold 2003 were unfolding, however, the world was anxiously watching the spread of another powerful force. In February 2003, atypical pneumonia with high mortality rates was seen in the Guangdong province of China and reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Later called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a newly recognized, highly pathogenic strain of coronavirus was found to be causal. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although SARS transmission was not recognized in the country of Thailand before Cobra Gold 2003, a small number of contained imported cases were documented. In anticipation of Cobra Gold 2003, the Kingdom of Thailand was concerned regarding the potential for participants to pass through or come from countries with known SARS transmission. To ease these concerns, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), with an 8-year history of surveillance and diagnosis of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) within active duty continental United States and deployed forces, was tasked with conducting laboratory-based, active surveillance for respiratory illnesses (including SARS) during the exercise, with the intent of early recognition and response. 7, 8 As concerns over SARS importation were eased with implementation of surveillance, valuable information on circulating respiratory pathogens during such an exercise was collected.', \"With coordination and logistic support from the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) (a joint U.S. Army-Royal Thai Army research facility located in Bangkok since 1958), respiratory illness surveillance was initiated by NHRC. AFRIMS has conducted routine diarrhea surveillance during Cobra Gold for many years, and researchers were able to easily accommodate respiratory surveillance in this exercise. In addition to the support received from AFRIMS, two main appointed medical care units, i.e., Fort Thanarat (located in the Hua Hin area, southwest of Bangkok) and Camp Samae San (located in Pattaya Beach, southeast of Bangkok), were selected as collection stations because of their U.S. military force proximity. Individual U.S. aid stations throughout Thailand were sent official notification of the surveillance through message traffic; this instructed the aid stations to send all patients meeting the FRI case definition to Fort Thanarat or Camp Samae San. The FRI case definition was oral temperature of Ն100.5°F and a respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing) or any diagnosed pneumonia. The surveillance was conducted for 2 weeks for personnel within the political borders of Thailand, from the official commencement of the exercise to its completion.\", 'Supplies, including viral transport medium, swabs (sterile Dacron), preprinted subject identification labels, FRI log sheets, and informed consent/case forms, were provided to both units. Before commencement of the exercise, a NHRC representative conducted training on data and specimen collection procedures. To record the number of personnel under surveillance and the number of those who presented with FRI symptoms, the clinicians at each medical care unit completed a daily summary form. Individuals who presented meeting the FRI case definition were asked to complete an informed consent/case form and to permit a throat swab. Travel and contact information was also requested for potential categorization as a \"suspect SARS case,\" 2 which required implementation of respiratory isolation precautions with immediate evaluation.', \"Diagnostic specimens were collected with a sterile Dacron swab and placed directly into viral transport medium. A preprinted subject identification label was placed on the vial, and the vial was immediately placed in a Ϫ70°C freezer or liquid nitrogen tank. Identical preprinted labels were placed on the case report form and the FRI log sheet. Once the exercise ended, Camp Samae San and Fort Thanarat transported all specimens to AFRIMS, and shipment to the NHRC Respiratory Disease Laboratory was arranged.\", \"Samples received at the NHRC Respiratory Disease Laboratory were processed in both the classic virology laboratory, with cell culture techniques (A549 and RMK cells), 7 and in the molecular laboratory, with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-PCR methods. Testing was performed for influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, coronaviruses (229E and OC43), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus. All samples positive for influenza A were typed with four additional primer sets (N1, N3, H1, and H3) . A portion of the H3 gene was sequenced for all influenza A-positive samples, for phylogenetic comparison. Because viral transport medium was used to collect the specimens, no testing was conducted for bacterial pathogens. If SARS coronavirus testing had been required, NHRC would have used the real-time, reverse transcriptase-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with validation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 9\", \"The number of troops under surveillance during the exercise was estimated to average 4,800 over a 2-week period; 17 patients were seen who met the case definition, for an attack rate of 0.18 FRI cases per 100 recruit-weeks. Sixteen of the 17 patients provided a diagnostic specimen. The average age of these 16 individuals was 27 years; all were male, seven were U.S. Marine Corps, seven were U.S. Army, one was U.S. Air Force, and one was not determined. The average symptom duration was 3.7 days; one of the 16 patients was hospitalized with pneumonia. None of the patients had a history of asthma, and all except one had been vaccinated with the influenza vaccine within the past 12 months (two unknown). Six of the 16 individuals were smokers, with an average of 2.2 pack-years.\", \"Of the 16 diagnostic specimens received, seven (44%) tested positive for influenza A, 2 (13%) for coronavirus OC43, 2 (13%) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1 (6%) for rhinovirus. The remaining four (25%) were negative. No case met the case definition for a suspect SARS case during the surveillance; therefore, patient isolation and urgent investigations were not required. Of the individuals meeting the case definition for FRI, only one had significant symptoms necessitating further evaluation and chest radiographs. This individual was one of the two respiratory syncytial virus-positive individuals. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all seven influenza A strains were more closely related to the Fujian/411 lineage than the Panama, as illustrated in Figure 1 .\", \"Concern over potential SARS transmission provided the momentum for cooperation and facilitation necessary to conduct this surveillance. Although no SARS suspect case was identified, valuable information was gathered regarding circulating respiratory pathogens among our deployed troops in this setting. Most interesting, influenza A was identified for 44% of the presenting patients (7 of 16 patients). Given the potential for genetic recombination and drift of influenza A virus and concern over the potential for another influenza pandemic similar in scope to the devastating pandemic of 1918, the global community is renewing efforts to improve global influenza surveillance. Particularly in regions of the Far East where living conditions are often in close proximity to avian and swine populations, the risk for human acquisition of recombined influenza viruses with increased pathogenic potential is real. Indeed, of the influenza A isolates sequenced, all were found to be closely related to the Fujian strain (Fig. 1) , which was the predominant influenza strain seen globally in the subsequent 2003/2004 influenza season but was not covered by the 2003/2004 influenza vaccine preparation. 10, 11 A weakness of this surveillance was lack of data indicating the percentage capture of those meeting the case definition. Given the great concern over SARS transmission, however, we are confident that capture of FRI was better than it would have been in years without this concern. In addition, the surveillance period was relatively short, indicating that individuals in the presymptomatic stages of infection likely came back to the United States. Given this risk, real-time knowledge of pathogens in circulation would be useful. To this end, field implementation of diagnostic technologies, such as classic PCR or real-time PCR methods (such as with the LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana), would be a valuable addition to surveillance such as this in remote regions.\", \"Critical surveillance for infectious agents causing FRI during overseas military exercises can be conducted, although logistical barriers must be overcome. Given concern over emerging pathogens such as SARS and the known potential for emergence of newly pathogenic influenza strains such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, opportunities for laboratorybased surveillance for respiratory pathogens among our deployed troops should be sought. Valuable information on the epidemiological features of these pathogens will be gained as we monitor the potential importation of emerging pathogens into the United States.\"],\n    tags: {\n

Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan city has now spread to the whole country and even the world [1]. The major routes of the coronavirus infection are the respiratory droplets, close contact transmission, and also when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment for a long time [2]. The incubation period of COVID-19 is up to 24 days. The most common symptoms were fever and cough, and some severe cases can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. The Chinese government has initiated a first-level response to major public health emergencies, mobilized the whole country to fight against the epidemic, made comprehensive deployments, and implemented the strongest and strictest prevention and control measures. By the end of March, the epidemic situation has been under control across China. However, the pandemic of COVID-19 is global now.\", \"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the malignancy with the fourth highest prevalence among females and fifth among males in China [4]. CRC patients were generally in poor immunity and physical fitness, which are susceptible to COVID-19. A prospective cohort study has found that cancer patients were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and had a worse prognosis than those without tumors [5].\", \"During this particular period, most hospitals have suspended or postponed outpatient and elective surgery. Therefore, how to deal with CRC patients is challenging and essential. As follows, we introduce our single center's experience in the management of CRC patients during COVID-19 outbreak and present a series of issues of our clinical work (Table 1).\", \"Not as the previous, all outpatient clinics request appointments now. CRC patients should make an appointment in advance, and only one family member is allowed to accompany to prevent cross-infection.\", \"The medical workers, patients and families need to strengthen their own protection, such as wearing surgical masks, goggles, and so on. We also pay attention to the disinfection of outpatient equipment and the environment.\", \"At the clinic, a rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms is needed. Patients with a history of living or traveling in the affected area, close contacts with a confirmed or probable case, or having fever and respiratory symptoms, should be checked during pre-diagnosis. And then, if suspected COVID-19 manifestations, the patient should be sent to the fever clinic. If a suspected or confirmed case is diagnosed, the patient shall be immediately quarantined and reported.\", \"At the outpatient, we choose simple and convenient regimen, and also establish a long prescription policy to facilitate patients to receive drugs for 2 to 3 months at a time, to reduce the times of visiting.\", \"The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend that adjuvant chemotherapy should be started as soon as possible after recovery, generally about 3 weeks after CRC operation, and no later than 2 months [6]. A meta-analysis of 15 410 CRC patients showed that the start of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed every 4 weeks, patients' overall survival time and disease-free survival time will be significantly reduced [7]. Therefore, we recommend postponing adjuvant chemotherapy appropriately at the local hospital as the first choice. Moreover, we prefer the three-week CapeOX regimen to biweekly FOLFOX regimen, so that we can minimize the chance of cross-infection. Oral capecitabine monotherapy also could be used as much as possible. In addition, we recommend that the patients can contact the physicians to reduce the treatment intensity and switch to oral therapy.\", \"During the epidemic, many hospitals suspended radiotherapy. The Chinese FOWARC Trial showed that no significant difference in outcomes was found between mFOLFOX6 without radiotherapy and fluorouracil with radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer [8]. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone with the mFOLFOX6 regimen is also an option.\", \"For patients with metastatic CRC, Multi-Disciplinary Treatment (MDT) is the best choice. If the condition is stable, the original chemotherapy regimen can be maintained for another 1-2 cycles until the MDT outpatient restore. If there is obvious progression, we recommend online MDT clinics or communicating with physicians via WeChat or telephone to change the regimen.\", \"Undoubtedly, traditional Chinese medicine has certain effects on improving the physical condition of CRC patients, which can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life [9]. Considering the patients' resistance during chemotherapy is relatively low, we also recommend regular thymosin to improve immunity as prescribed [10].\", \"CRC surgeons should control the routine operation to reduce the patient's exposure time in the hospital [11]. For CRC patients with mass bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, emergency surgery should be considered, and COVID-19 infection needs to be ruled out before.\", \"Endoscopic surgery is recommended for early-stage CRC when it is completely removed clearly with good histological features, and no additional surgical treatment is required. Whether surgery delay affects survival remains controversial for advanced CRC. We prefer to expand neoadjuvant therapy indications for low to moderate locally advanced rectal cancer. And we try to conduct surgery for advanced colon cancer as early as possible. A detailed investigation and a comprehensive examination (chest CT or viral nucleic acid test) should be performed to exclude COVID-19 before elective surgery. In addition, we also do not recommend to perform colorectal and liver resections simultaneously at the current situation, so as to avoid a prolonged hospital stay and increased risk of infection.\", \"At the surgical ward, we prefer minimally invasive surgery plus a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) as the best treatment strategy, which could accelerate patient recovery and shorten hospital stay [12].\", \"The hospital should strictly implement the National Health Commission's requirements for infection control in medical institutions [13]. Ordinary patients who underwent CRC resection can be transferred to the general ward after surgery. It is necessary to reduce the movement of accompanying staff and personnel. Patients with postoperative fever should be carefully identified and isolated according to the suspected COVID-19 criteria [2]. And then suspected or confirmed patients should be transferred to a designated negative pressure isolation monitoring room for single room isolation.\", \"CRC and COVID-19 are double blows to patients. Many patients have mental health problems of anxiety and depression, so we should give positive psychological support during the epidemic. We inform that the prognosis of CRC is not so bad, and even with recurrence, a considerable part of the patients will be cured when metastases are detected and resected early [14]. Stoma patients are also encouraged to communicate with families and friends, learn to self-regulate bad moods, and actively integrate into society. At the same time, we also inform the patients that they will not be infected if actively protect, and the epidemic situation is getting better now, which will return to normal soon. Even if the treatment is appropriately delayed, it will not affect the treatment effect. At present, several public institutions and domestic hospitals have launched psychological hotline services, and we recommend patients could contact when needed.\", \"A healthy lifestyle is especially important for CRC patients. Studies have shown that smokers have a significantly increased risk of developing and dying from CRC compared with never-smokers, and heavy drinking also increases the risk of developing CRC [15]. We recommend CRC patients a healthy and balanced lifestyle diet, avoiding high fat and low fiber diet, reducing the intake of red meat and processed meat. The American Gastroenterological Association has recommended calcium supplements for the primary or secondary prevention of colon cancer, so we also recommend appropriate intake of calcium-rich food such as dairy products [16]. CRC patients also need to appropriately increase the intake of cellulose and decrease irritating and too much oily food. Stoma patients can properly consume dairy products and vegetables to reduce the odor at the stoma. In addition, we also suggest that during the epidemic, patients can arrange indoor physical exercise under the guidance of the physicians, avoiding prolonged bed rest, which can promote the recovery of intestinal function and prevent deep vein thrombosis.\", \"Recently, many health organizers have opened public-interest online lectures and free mobile applications for different patient groups, to provide disease education and answer questions online. Furthermore, several university hospitals have also opened up various online clinics, including online fever clinics, psychological clinics, specialist clinics and online MDT clinics. In addition, we also have established several follow-up WeChat groups for CRC patients. When CRC patients have questions, they can get medical advice quickly from multiple experts at home.\", \"For patients who need to be reviewed after CRC surgery during the epidemic, we recommend that the review time can be appropriately postponed. We encourage patients to complete routine review projects at the nearest medical institution. After they obtain the review results, it is recommended to adopt an online network method for consultation.\", \"In summary, our current clinical work model has to be changed due to COVID-19 outbreak, which includes the above outpatient, inpatient, psychological treatment and health education.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,8\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,13\": \"problem\",\n

Cases, however, situate the knowledge in real-world contexts. Here, the cases provide the primary occasion for learning, rather than serve secondarily as illustrations or applications. Nor are cases merely “teasers” or “hooks” for opening a presentation of abstract content. Rather, the cases become integral to the structure of learning.\", \"Contextualization fosters two major effects. First, it enhances learning by providing associations that facilitate memory storage, retention, and retrieval: the knowledge is more meaningful. Second, it also helps motivate learning. Cases convey that the knowledge is relevant or useful, sometimes by showing its human dimension. Such contextual and human connections seem especially important (in today's culture) in fostering interest among women/girls and minorities, as well as among nonmajors. Such benefits indicate a vital role for careful selection of cases to fit particular groups of students, their contexts (age, locality, culture), interests, and levels of background knowledge.\", \"CBL, however, may not provide a comprehensive and organized view of the knowledge, typically conveyed in didactic approaches. That is, the formal structure of a substantial domain of knowledge may not be evident when knowledge is accumulated by piecemeal sampling. (For example, a case profiling only a few organelles in the cell may eclipse awareness of the full diversity of organelles. A focus on just the nitrogen cycle alone may forsake a broader awareness of other mineral cycles and their general role in ecosystems.) Nevertheless, a carefully constructed curriculum may use complementary cases to cover standard curricular content (see Schwartz et al., 1997). On the other hand, some evidence indicates that learning occurs primarily, or most vividly, through exemplars (Kolodner et al., 1996; Gentner et al., 2003; Gentner and Colhoun, 2008). One case or example serves as a model, or paradigm, for interpreting other similar cases (Kuhn, 1970, pp. 23, 187–191). A well-articulated sample may be as valuable as comprehensive coverage.\", \"For more on the benefits and limits of CBL generally, see Barnes et al. (1994) and Lunberg et al. (1999). For sample textbooks using a case structure, see (at the undergraduate level) Postlethwait and Hopson (2003) and Schwartz et al. (1997) and (at the secondary level) Leonard et al. (1998, 2008) and American Chemical Society (2006).\", \"Another way to engage students in their own learning is posing problems for students to solve. These embody the rationale for learning, which is elsewise typically based solely on the authority of the instructor (or, by default, a textbook). Typically, such problems are rooted in cases (although they need not be, or the case itself may be quite minimalistic). Not all CBL is problem based, however. Cases may function merely as narratives, or as a setting for knowledge. This may be so even when a story (say, the case of an important historical discovery) helps students learn how a scientist encountered and solved a problem.\", \"In PBL, the problem is posed to the student, who then takes an active role in solving it. Active learning—itself expressed in various ways—is widely recognized as enhancing motivation and depth and persistence of learning (Bonwell and Eison, 1991; Michael, 2006; see section on autonomy below). The introduction of cogent problems thus tends to amplify the basic virtues of using cases themselves—provided the problems are framed in ways relevant to the student. Almost any declarative knowledge can be rephrased as a question or problem. However, just as a case should be judiciously selected, a problem should be properly framed and contextualized if it is indeed to be motivational. The teacher who begins, without context, “Today we study the pancreas; now, what is a pancreas?,” does not engage student interest. Indeed, students can easily spot a rhetorical problem or pseudoproblem. “Cookbook” problems are just like cookbook labs. A teacher who needs to institute substantial external motivators for students to complete work, for example, has probably not found the proper problem to inspire active, student-centered learning. One may consider framing and contextualizing problems as one of the primary instructional skills for this mode of teaching.\", \"In addition, engagement with problems introduces a deeper layer of thinking: about the generation of knowledge, about the nature or quality of evidence, about reasoning, and so on. It may foster a habit of curiosity or of questioning assumptions. Problems tend to promote reflective thinking. Posing problems provides an opportunity, but an instructor must also highlight these features in student activities and assessments.\", \"Cases may certainly combine a case narrative and problems. One effective method interrupts a story or punctuates it with a series of well-contextualized problems (Hagen et al., 1996; Herreid, 2005).\", \"For more on the benefits and limits of PBL generally, see Duch et al. (2001), Dochy et al. (2003), Hmelo-Silver (2004), and Major and Palmer (2001). Also relevant is the substantial literature on the role of anomalies, discrepant events, and cognitive dissonance in stimulating learning.\", \"The pedagogical function of cases or problems can vary. In a widely used model (Barrows, 1986), the problem is considered primarily a vehicle for learning content, which ultimately answers the given question or solves the problem at hand. In other cases, the problem engages students in practicing or developing problem-solving skills through firsthand experience. (Here, one should plan on providing a framework for students to learn new skills, not just exercise existing abilities.) Both styles, appropriately adapted, may also help foster deeper understanding of the nature of science (or of scientific practice, how science works, or the context of science broadly speaking). However, learning about the nature of science should be both explicit and reflective (Craven, 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004; Scharmann et al., 2005; Seker and Welsh, 2005). That is, one should pose problems specifically about the nature of science and engage students in discussion. These three aims are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some cases may well integrate these (e.g., see Hagen et al., 1996; Allchin, 2012).\", \"The ultimate aim of education will be reflected in—and communicated to students most vividly through—the forms of evaluation. Initiating efforts to teach problem-solving skills or understanding of the nature of science may well require a shift in modes of assessment and/or grading standards. Teachers will surely benefit in any event by reflecting how the learning objectives of their courses are coupled to the ways they ask students to demonstrate or exhibit such learning.\", \"The problems students encounter can be of two general kinds: problems in which students can use knowledge that already exists or problems that involve research that generates new knowledge. (New, here, is defined relative to the student.) Repairing a car engine is quite different from designing one. Diagnosing a patient with an already documented disease is quite different from studying the etiology of a wholly new disease. The terms investigation, research, or problem solving are all potentially ambiguous, denoting either alternative. But research in solving a problem is substantively different from research that generates the knowledge used to solve such problems: crudely the difference between technology and science.\", \"If the learning objectives emphasize content and/or its cultural contexts, one can ostensibly focus on applications alone. Students will draw on a known repertoire of knowledge. (This is typical of problem cases or scenarios in medicine, law, business, engineering, applied ethics, and other professional training—areas in which PBL and CBL first emerged. All are based on precedent, even if the cases invite creatively recombining existing ideas.)\", \"However, if one wants students to learn about the process of science or research, the problems should be about developing knowledge: exploring genuine unknowns (for the student) and creating knowledge, not merely finding or interpreting known facts. Students should experience “science in the making,” as opposed to “ready-made science” (Latour, 1987). Learning about the role of empirical evidence as a foundation of scientific knowledge is critical to shaping one dimension of epistemological understanding: Is knowledge justified by omniscient authority or evidence (Schommer, 1990)?\", \"The knowledge-generating/knowledge-applying distinction does not currently seem widely discussed in treatments of CBL and PBL. Yet failure to recognize the distinction can foster misleading impressions about the aims, benefits, or structure of PBL in science education.\", \"Cases may be historical or contemporary, or completely abstracted from any historical context. Here, the relevant dimension (using “history” as a label) is whether the problem being considered has been solved or remains unsolved. The status of the problem's solution is critical to the possible epistemic lessons about how knowledge is developed.\", \"Contemporary cases often appeal to students by being relevant, current, or fashionable. They convey that science is happening now, affording a sense of immediacy or authenticity (Wong et al., 2008). Students may even encounter some cases in the news (relevant just to the degree that students seriously attend to current events). Current problem cases that focus on the context of science can offer rehearsals for participating in personal decision making or social policy in future life. However, care should be taken in such cases to enrich the learning rather than merely elicit and reinforce existing perspectives. Ironically, evaluating the epistemic process in such cases is problematic. One needs time to know whether a proposed solution ultimately turned out to be reliable or well considered.\", \"Historical cases have their own virtues (Conant, 1947; Nash, 1951; Hagen et al., 1996, pp. v–vii; Allchin, 1997, 2012). First, the benchmark content knowledge in standard science curricula originated long ago. The strategic pedadgogical constructivist will thus look to history for clues about how such concepts may be constructed from earlier facts and perspectives, as well as how they may be alternatively conceived or criticized. Imagine the sense of validation when informing a student that the concept he or she just developed is the same concept discovered earlier by a famous scientist! Second, historical narratives are prime opportunities for teaching about scientific practice, because historians are able to render the historical context, bringing together experimental details with cultural events and perspectives and scientific disputes. These are the elements for recreating science in the making. Students may participate in (re)generating knowledge at a conceptual level corresponding to their own.\", \"Third, history seems essential for conveying certain lessons about the nature of science, most notably about cultural bias in scientific ideas, conceptual change, and uncertainty and error (or how scientific knowledge—new findings, in particular—can be uncertain and/or provisional) (Solomon et al., 1992; Irwin, 2000). Tentativeness of scientific knowledge, for example, has been a pervasive learning goal in science education for many decades (Lederman et al., 1998), and constitutes a significant dimension of epistemological belief—the stability of scientific knowledge (Schommer, 1990). To learn about conceptual change, however, one ideally engages in and experiences the change. Here, a case should be properly contextualized in history, not rationally reconstructed (Allchin, 1996, 2004). To enable informative contrast of a reasonable “before” with an unexpected “after,” the whole problem-solving episode should be amenable to retrospective analysis. It should be historical. In a similar way, to appreciate gender or racial bias or other ways that cultural perspectives may sometimes become blindly naturalized in science, one should be at a relatively remote vantage point to see the culture as culture. History and historical perspective are indispensable for such nature-of-science lessons.\", \"Finally, historical cases tend to change less with time. This year's “hot” topic will be passé soon, and the work assembling and refining a new contemporary case will start all over again. Cost–benefit ratio of teacher preparation may be considered.\", \"Does the problem have one solution (possibly hidden) or many possible solutions? That is, in terms of the student's problem solving, is the process close-ended or open-ended? (Or, in terms of the literature on creativity, is the cognitive process convergent or divergent?) Each type shapes student motivation and an understanding of science (Cliff and Nesbitt, 2005). A problem for which there is a single known solution places students in a vulnerable position. Anytime a teacher “fishes” for a right answer, the responder risks being “wrong.” Such situations tend to alienate students—typically expressed as silence or acquiescence. Similarly, a problem framed with an expected solution can diminish rather than enhance student motivation. Some students, of course, revel in puzzle-solving. Others feel threatened. Close-ended problems can also (alas) foster cheating or rationalization (working backward from a target solution)—quite the opposite of what is intended. Where science content and/or information-finding skills are the aim, PBL may tend toward close-ended problems. But it need not. In biology, in particular, problems might be reframed and answered at different organizational levels simultaneously. Close-ended problems may also be used to help develop problem-solving or analytical skills—but then one should carefully tailor assessment accordingly to promote and reward those skills, rather than just to yield “the right answer.” Finally, close-ended problems tend to support naive epistemological understanding of knowledge as stable, predetermined, and authority based (Schommer, 1990).\", \"Open-ended problems, by contrast, tend to promote more creative skills and thus motivate a wider variety of students. Such types of problems also seem essential for developing an epistemological understanding that knowledge is both creative and empirical and that science, while evidence based, is contingent, sometimes underdetermined and provisional. Historical problems, ostensibly already solved, would seem to be close-ended, but they can be situated in their original context, in an open-ended framework in which process and reasoning is more important than any specific conclusion. As noted above, investigations framed in historical context become science in the making again. (Indeed, teachers may face the greater challenge, trying to temporarily blind themselves to known outcomes in order to focus on process alone.)\", \"The cases that contextualize knowledge may be drawn from real-life examples, or they may be imaginatively assembled for an educational context. Constructed cases may be created to fit particular needs. They may be as simple or complex as one wants. They may be freely edited and streamlined to highlight core concepts or learning aims. One may readily generalize from them. On the other hand, constructed cases often carry an implicit aura of artificiality. They risk diminishing their motivational value if a student feels that they are contrived.\", \"Real cases, by contrast, are indeed authentic, although they are often messy. Still, the messiness can be an asset. First, the unique constellation of particulars can help demonstrate the sometimes unexpected ways in which different factors in science interact (sources of funding, personality, happenstance, disparate facts, etc.). Second, they can help students learn how to negotiate in a complex world. How does one recognize and tease out the relevant variables? Third, they may also contribute to shaping another basic dimension of epistemological belief: The structure of knowledge can be complex, not always simple (Schommer, 1990).\", \"At an impressive extreme, students—even nonscience majors or K–12 students—might participate in ongoing research. While tasks might not be any more demanding than gathering data, students may certainly understand the context of the work, see closely how it is structured, and take pride in contributing to developing original scientific knowledge (Crawford, 2012).\", \"Only some problems in the world (perhaps quite few) are well defined. A complete education thus helps develop skills in articulating ill-defined problems (Jonassen, 1997). One may also help foster skills in posing problems (Jungck, 1985; Gonzales, 1998). However, problem-solving skills themselves may well be best developed when the problem is already well defined and students are appropriately motivated. Of course, a problem may be redefined or dissolved: that may be part of the solution (concluding that the problem was ill framed or ill conceived at the outset).\", \"Ill-defined problems are typically a significant component in medical school problem-based education, reflecting the central role of diagnosis in clinical medicine—that is, of finding, characterizing, and identifying how or why the patient is not well. By contrast, cases used in business schools or law schools tend to be more well defined, reflecting the custom of addressing client-based criteria. In either case, refining or redefining a given problem—or even dissolving it entirely—may well enter the process en route to a solution, as found in scientific research as well.\", \"A special category of PBL involves investigating rich data sets. These are already established measurements or results, but they are vast enough for exploration. Still, in an educational context, they have identifiable boundaries. Students may thus pose original problems that the data set may help answer. At the same time, one might entertain such enterprises mindfully. Some students may not share the instructor's or other students’ enthusiasm for investigation, even if they are given the freedom to frame their own question. Such students may thus become overwhelmed, discouraged, or even resentful. Opening problem-posing to students has risks (see also section on autonomy below).\", \"Like other forms of education, CBL or PBL may be either individual, collaborative, or cooperative. For more on the benefits and limits of cooperative learning in general, see Johnson and Johnson (1991). In PBL and CBL, classroom practice becomes an implicit general model for how research or problem solving is done. Is knowledge generated individually or collectively?\", \"Collaborative problem solving often involves special skills, such as brainstorming and supportive critique, which ideally become part of instruction. Collaboration should be further distinguished from cooperation, or group work, in which the product does not document or acknowledge the individual contributions of each group member (Panitz, 1996). That is, collaborative work maintains individual accountability. Each student may be responsible for a full product (case analysis, problem solution report, essay, exam, etc.) or for a discrete, identifiable portion of a final work product.\", \"Collaboration may be exercised on several levels—in pairs, in small teams, or even in large groups. Some exercises, such as a model United Nations, model Congress, or simulated summit on climate change may include dozens or hundreds of students. Role-play simulations, especially, can allow for creative synthesis among many unique student contributors within the same class, and thus exhibit the power of collaborative engagement. To help illustrate the epistemic value of collaboration, fragments of information for solving a complex problem may well be artfully distributed among different roles.\", \"While collaboration offers many potential benefits, working communally on a joint problem may be at odds with an individual pursuing a problem of personal relevance. Motivation (an alternative pedagogical aim) may suffer. Even if there is a consensus or a joint decision-making process, the shared problem may not engage all participants equally. Role-playing may be an effective pedagogical strategy for fostering a sense of personal responsibility through a vicarious as-if scenario.\", \"Cases or problems are often addressed cogently from a single perspective, whether of a contemporary individual or a renowned historical scientist. Simple cases streamline the process of problem solving, which is perhaps appropriate for the initial stages of PBL learning. However, some cases are problematic, precisely because interpretations of the core problem differ. Here, a student learns, first, that problem solving or research may not be exclusively individual or univocal: That is, it does not unfold according to some universal linear algorithm (such as “the” scientific method). Multiple perspectives may also prove an asset. Other viewpoints may reveal alternative solutions not readily envisioned within a particular mind-set or background. One of the greatest benefits of any class discussion may be simply exposing students to other perspectives. This can deepen their awareness of alternatives. Students report that they thereby broaden their ways of thinking. They can learn merely from listening to how other students view the same facts differently.\", \"Cases with multiple perspectives offer opportunities to teach about the social dimensions of developing knowledge and solving problems. Social epistemology, for example, has been highlighted recently by many philosophers of science (Longino, 1990; Goldman, 1999, 2002; Solomon, 2001), as well as by science educators (Osborne, 2010). When varying perspectives interact, one can enhance ways to analyze a problem or imagine its solution. Here, the instructional goal is to guide students in learning discursive skills, such as active listening, that contribute to such social-level analysis. Even criticism may have a positive role, exposing weak assumptions or increasing rigor of evidence. Tolerating criticism may an emotional or attitudinal skill, but it seems to have epistemic value. In yet other cases, in which interpretations conflict, students may learn skills in negotiating solutions or finding creative ways to accommodate apparently incompatible views (Fisher et al., 1991). Thus, CBL or PBL may adopt the familiar forms of a debate or role-play simulation (for well-developed complex examples, see Dunn et al. [2009] on Darwin and the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1862; Allchin [2009a] on Galileo's trial in 1633; Allchin [2009b] on a presidential commission on pesticides in 1963; and Montgomery [2010] on glacial geology in 1843). Designated roles provide students a concrete perspective for interpreting a case or problem, which can serve as additional grounding. Unfamiliar roles (or sides in a debate) can also enhance appreciation of alternative perspectives. Even when students continue to work primarily on their own, however, one may still find a fruitful learning role for an exchange of multiple perspectives.\", \"The scope or magnitude of a case or problem itself may vary substantially, each with corresponding lessons. For brevity, consider three simple levels. First, vignettes or short stories focus on one relatively narrow question or problem. They can be easily inserted in a lecture format, say. But they are also limited. They convey that science and problem solving is easy and reductionistic. Second, lessons might extend over a full class period, as one activity or a series of short, related problems. Finally, one may use major projects that extend over several class periods, weeks, or the bulk of a semester if the complexity of the problem allows. For examples of the latter, see White (1992) on hemoglobin in biochemistry, Tewksbury (1999) on geology and the Aswan Dam, or Klassen (2006) on electrodynamics and the transatlantic cable. To the degree that science is complex and that education implicitly frames expectations beyond the classroom, teachers may well be encouraged to include some complex case studies or problems at some point in their courses as an indication of the real world and as an occasion for developing interpretive and organizational skills appropriate to such situations. One may also structure a series of lessons through a lineage of problems—as is frequently already done in teaching transmission genetics, atomic models, or the wave/particle nature of light (for example, the biology text by Mix et al. [1996] is organized on this principle).\", \"Scaling problems appropriately also has an important affective dimension, relevant to students’ long-term motivational context. In introducing PBL, especially, one might aim initially to create successful experiences, to promote positive attitudes toward further work (or at least averting a sense of failure that discourages future effort!). Coping with perceived failure as an outcome—or as a potential opportunity for learning—may itself be a goal but may well be reserved for more advanced levels.\", \"Student selection of the problem may contribute to the sense of ownership that makes the learning personal. But it need not. Some problems may be justified as of general interest or in a framework of public responsibility.\", \"One caution here is that, while the student may choose the problem, he or she generally does not have the option of not choosing a problem (say, because there is nothing of intrinsic interest). Here, the goal of using context as a motivator is lost.\", \"Does the teacher ever answer a question with anything other than another question? Depending on the local aims, the teacher may provide plentiful background information, including standard lectures. Alternatively, the student may be responsible for finding all such information (perhaps with guidance at the level of how to find that information). Or some intermediate form of support may be suitable to the aims and occasion at hand. The respective student challenges should not be overlooked.\", \"Problem-solving activities may be teacher-guided or student-directed. Guided work may be more important than earlier imagined (Mayer, 2004; Minstrell and Kraus, 2005), at least initially. Again, one responsibility for the instructor is to be familiar with (or pre-assess) student abilities and to frame problems at an achievable level. Even when students have autonomy, the teacher has a critical role as advisor and coach and possibly as a resource guide.\", \"When problem solving is collaborative, an important role is facilitating discussion. Teachers may adopt this role initially, again to model appropriate skills or to monitor and adjust progress along the way. Alternatively, students may be encouraged to develop such skills, sometimes in small groups, in an explicitly designated role.\", \"An important dimension of collaborative work is developing consensus when interpretations differ, especially by appeal to evidence and reasoning, rather than external authority (the instructor, say, or the textbook). Persuasion, argumentation, active listening, revising, and accommodating conflict creatively are among the skills to be addressed in a complete problem-solving education (Fisher et al., 1991; Osborne, 2010).\", \"Instructional strategies labeled as PBL and CBL embrace a wide range of intersecting but independent values. While some advocates may try to enforce strict definitions or “best practices,” an informed instructor should understand the various alternatives and be mindful of the differential outcomes (Table 1).\", \"Many educators construe CBL and PBL merely as methods. They imply that an instructor need only learn how to use the method, without understanding or endorsing the values or objectives embodied in certain aspects of the teaching style. The misaligned objectives and teaching style can confound students and, ironically, tarnish teaching quality. The discussion of the values and outcomes above can help inform effective choices and instructional design.\", \"Also, while noting a key role for motivation, many educators tend to profile PBL and CBL narrowly in cognitive terms. They sometimes overlook potential affective outcomes that shape, among other things, a learner's investment in learning and a respectful and fruitful teacher–student relationship. Also, while parading the virtues of critical thinking or higher-order thinking skills, introductory presentations may disregard the implicit epistemic or nature-of-science lessons. For example, problem cases that apply knowledge may convey content well, but simultaneously present science as a reservoir of pre-established knowledge. They may eclipse epistemic understanding about how science generates new knowledge. Indeed, every science lesson indirectly conveys a message about scientific practices and the nature of scientific knowledge. The effective instructor mindfully manages these lessons, aware of potentially unintended outcomes.\", \"Finally, much educational research to date on the efficacy of PBL has been multivariate and failed to differentiate the roles of the individual dimensions noted above. What is the relationship between particular dimensions of teaching and particular outcomes for learners (e.g., motivation, attitudes toward the subject, autonomy in problem solving, problem-solving biases, nature-of-science understanding, and epistemological lessons), and when do they overlap? Ideally, research on CBL or PBL will focus on articulating the relevant variables and their corresponding effects.\", \"Most important, it may be prudent to acknowledge that the family of PBL and CBL strategies are not a panacea for any deficit in science education. They are tools. When used appropriately, a tool can be useful. But the specific tool depends on particular contexts and values. Even lecturing may, on occasion, have an indispensable role (say, in conveying the overall structure and organization of a field's knowledge).\", \"Acknowledging the limitations of CBL and PBL, however, one may also underscore the opportunities they offer. For example, one can hardly learn problem-solving skills without engaging problems. Posing problems for students to solve thus seems a central tool for much analytical and creative skill development. Likewise, participation in knowledge-generating cases, whether direct or vicarious, seems integral to learning or appreciating the nature of scientific research. Similarly, historical cases seem important to learning certain core nature-of-science themes. Finally, to develop more sophisticated epistemological perspectives, students should be exposed to complex cases (complex structure of knowledge), historical cases (conceptual change), knowledge-generating cases (empiricism as a source of authority), and successful experience in problem solving (active role of the knower; Schommer, 1990). Such views are, ultimately, foundational to continued and autonomous learning—namely, learning how to learn.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,0\": \"test\",\n        \"0,1\":

coronavirus infection named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019). Noncontrast chest CT may be considered for early diagnosis of viral disease, although viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the standard of reference. Chung et al. reported that chest CT may be negative for viral pneumonia of COVID-19 [2] at initial presentation (3/21 patients). Recently, Xie reported 5/167 (3%) patients who had negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 at initial presentation despite chest CT findings typical of viral pneumonia [3]. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of chest CT and viral nucleic acid assay at initial patient presentation.\", \"The retrospective analysis was approved by institutional review board and patient consent was waived. Patients at Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital were evaluated from January 19, 2020 to February 4, 2020. During this period, chest CT and RT-PCR (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) was performed for consecutive patients who presented with a history of 1) travel or residential history in Wuhan or local endemic areas or contact with individuals with individuals with fever or respiratory symptoms from these areas within 14 days and 2) had fever or acute respiratory symptoms of unknown cause. In the case of an initial negative RT-PCR test, repeat testing was performed at intervals of 1 day or more. Of these patients, we included all patients who had both noncontrast chest CT scan (slice thickness, 5mm) and RT-PCR testing within an interval of 3 days or less and who had an eventual confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR testing (Figure 1). Typical and atypical chest CT findings were recorded according to CT features previously described for COVD-19 (4,5). The detection rate of COVID-19 infection based on the initial chest CT and RT-PCR was compared. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar Chi-squared test with significance at the p <.05 level.\", \"51 patients (29 men and 22 women) were included with median age of 45 (interquartile range, 39- 55) years. All patients had throat swab (45 patients) or sputum samples (6 patients) followed by one or more RT-PCR assays. The average time from initial disease onset to CT was 3 +/- 3 days; the average time from initial disease onset to RT-PCR testing was 3 +/- 3 days. 36/51 patients had initial positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. 12/51 patients had COVID-19 confirmed by two RT-PCR nucleic acid tests (1 to 2 days), 2 patients by three tests (2-5 days) and 1 patient by four tests (7 days) after initial onset.\", \"50/51 (98%) patients had evidence of abnormal CT compatible with viral pneumonia at baseline while one patient had a normal CT. Of 50 patients with abnormal CT, 36 (72%) had typical CT manifestations (e.g. peripheral, subpleural ground glass opacities, often in the lower lobes (Figure 2) and 14 (28%) had atypical CT manifestations (Figure 3) [2]. In this patient sample, difference in detection rate for initial CT (50/51 [98%, 95% CI 90-100%]) patients was greater than first RT-PCR (36/51 [71%, 95%CI 56-83%]) patients (p<.001).\", \"In our series, the sensitivity of chest CT was greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 71%, respectively, p<.001). The reasons for the low efficiency of viral nucleic acid detection may include: 1) immature development of nucleic acid detection technology; 2) variation in detection rate from different manufacturers; 3) low patient viral load; or 4) improper clinical sampling. The reasons for the relatively lower RT-PCR detection rate in our sample compared to a prior report are unknown (3). Our results support the use of chest CT for screening for COVD-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features compatible with COVID-19 infection particularly when RT-PCR testing is negative.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,6\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,7\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,9\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,10\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,14\":

storage. Moreover, the palmitoyl chain can be attached to proteins in a process called palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation), which modification affects their localization and functioning.\", \"In the human body palmitic acid is synthetized in a process called de novo lipogenesis. It takes place mainly in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and cells of lactating mammary glands (1). Palmitic acid is used for the synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids, may undergo elongation and/or desaturation into other fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid or oleic acid, respectively), and can be esterified to form storage lipids—triacylglycerols. Apart from de novo synthesis, palmitic acid is also provided to the human body with food. Since palmitic acid is universally found in natural fats, its consumption exceeds the consumption of other saturated fatty acids and, in the USA it accounts for about 60% of the total intake of saturated fatty acids (2). A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence points to a link between a westernized diet, including a high intake of saturated fatty acids, and chronic inflammatory diseases (3–5). As dietary saturated and unsaturated fatty acids apparently modulate activity of immune cells, their influence on the immune responses triggered upon infection is also beginning to be investigated (6). These facts drive the interest in palmitic acid with an aim of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of its immunomodulatory properties.\", \"In this review, we focus on S-palmitoylation of proteins crucial for the interactions of pathogenic bacteria and viruses with the host. We emphasize novel data on the role of S-palmitoylated proteins in the invasion of host cells by pathogens and those involved in the host innate immune responses to the infection, which have been obtained thanks to the application of new technical approaches. Recently, substantial progress in the understanding of protein palmitoylation was made possible by the development of methods allowing high-throughput analysis of cellular/tissue palmitoyl proteomes. We begin, however, by showing how unique protein S-palmitoylation is among other protein lipidations.\", \"S-palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins consisting in a potentially reversible covalent attachment of palmitoyl chain to a cysteine residue(s) of proteins through a thioester bond (Table 1). Thus, S-palmitoylation resembles other reversible regulatory posttranslational protein modifications, including phosphorylation or acetylation, well-established factors affecting protein structure and functions. In particular, S-palmitoylation modifies cellular localization of proteins and their stability. The most dramatic changes of localization concern cytosolic proteins which upon S-palmitoylation acquire a hydrophobic anchor facilitating their docking into membranes (Figure 1). However, several integral membrane proteins also undergo S-palmitoylation. It often occurs on cysteine residue(s) located in the proximity of the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the protein. S-palmitoylated transmembrane proteins occupy various cellular compartments, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane. In accordance, for some proteins, such as transmembrane adaptor proteins in leukocytes, S-palmitoylation was found secondary to the length and hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain as a determinant of plasma membrane destination (7).\", \"S-palmitoylation also contributes to the compartmentalization of proteins to distinct domains of membranes—rafts and tetraspanin-rich microdomains. In fact, the interest in S-palmitoylation was boosted when it was found to be required for the targeting of some signaling proteins to rafts. Rafts are nanodomains of the plasma membrane and some intracellular membranes, mainly of the trans-Golgi apparatus, rich in sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids with saturated fatty acid chains, and cholesterol (32). The plasma membrane nanodomains are sites of signal transduction by distinct receptors of immune cells involved in both acquired immune reactions, such as T cell receptor (TCR), Fcε receptor I, Fcγ receptor II, and in innate immune responses, such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (33, 34). Rafts are also sites of virion assembly and budding, as established, e.g., for influenza A virus and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (35, 36). Peripheral membrane proteins acylated with saturated fatty acids are likely to anchor preferentially between the ordered saturated lipids of rafts rather than between the disordered lipids of the surrounding membrane. It has been shown that, owing to their raft localization, S-palmitoylated kinases of the Src family interact with raft-associating plasma membrane immunoreceptors and initiate signaling cascades fundamental to acquired immunity (15, 37, 38). It is worth noting that also the acyl chains attached to proteins can affect the membrane structure. Studies on model membranes have revealed that palmitic and myristic acids facilitate formation of ordered lamellar membrane regions (39, 40). In accordance, S-palmitoylation of erythrocyte peripheral membrane protein called membrane-palmitoylated protein 1 (MPP1) was found to be required for the proper lateral organization and fluidity of erythrocyte membrane. In the absence of MPP1 S-palmitoylation, raft assembly was disturbed and erythrocyte functioning compromised leading to hemolytic anemia in patients deficient in the enzyme catalyzing this reaction (41, 42). Preferential raft association is a feature of some S-palmitoylated transmembrane proteins, e.g., adaptor proteins PAG, LAT, and NTAL, which collaborate with the abovementioned immunoreceptors. In fact, palmitoylation is required for the raft association of most integral raft proteins (8, 43, 44).\", \"On the other hand, S-palmitoylation does not obligatorily confer raft localization on transmembrane proteins. Certain S-palmitoylated proteins, such as transferrin receptor, glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and anthrax toxin receptor, tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), are actually excluded from rafts. Apparently, a combination of S-palmitoylation and the properties of the transmembrane domain of the protein contribute to its destination to the raft or non-raft environment (43, 45). It has also been proposed that the attachment of a fatty acyl chain at the juxtamembrane cysteine(s) of a protein can induce tilting of its transmembrane fragment, determining in which part of the membrane it will accommodate to avoid a hydrophobic mismatch potentially caused by the thickness of the bilayer (46).\", \"That not all S-palmitoylated proteins associate with rafts has been shown convincingly for macrophage-like RAW264 cells, where only about half of those proteins were found in the Triton X-100-resistant membrane fraction enriched in rafts (47, 48). In accordance, proteomic data on the distribution of S-palmitoylated proteins in prostate cancer cells have revealed that several such proteins are recovered in the non-raft (Triton X-100-soluble) fraction and are likely localized to microdomains enriched in scaffold proteins called tetraspanins (49). The tetraspanins are small integral membrane proteins found in the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes, having four transmembrane helices and undergoing S-palmitoylation at several conserved cysteine residues. The tetraspanins interact with each other and with various transmembrane and cytosolic partners, often also S-palmitoylated, forming microdomains (“tetraspanin web”) (50). It has been suggested that the amino acid composition of the S-palmitoylation site in some transmembrane proteins, such as the adaptor proteins involved in acquired immune responses, determines the association of those S-palmitoylated proteins with rafts or with the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (44). An intriguing and still poorly addressed question concerns the relation between rafts and the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, apparently of functional significance, e.g., during virus budding from host cells (35). This uncertainty stems partially from the fact that S-palmitoylation of tetraspanins governs their interactions with cholesterol and gangliosides leading at certain conditions to the recovery of tetraspanins in detergent-resistant membrane fractions enriched in rafts (51, 52). Besides its involvement in targeting proteins to rafts or tetraspanin-enriched microdomain, S-palmitoylation has been found to govern accumulation of the transmembrane chaperone protein calnexin in the perinuclear domain of endoplasmic reticulum (53).\", \"S-palmitoylation also affects protein stability through its interplay with ubiquitination or phosphorylation, as found for the anthrax toxin receptor TEM8, antiviral interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM1, calnexin, and zDHHC6, one of palmitoyl acyltransferases described below (54–57).\", \"Possibly the most intriguing is the reversible character of S-palmitoylation. Enzymes catalyzing palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of proteins have been characterized (58, 59). Palmitate is transferred onto the thiol group of cysteine from cytosolic palmitoyl-CoA by palmitoyl acyltransferases, enzymes containing the zinc finger DHHC domain named after the highly conserved Asp–His–His–Cys peptide (Figure 1). This is a two-step reaction comprising transient autoacylation of zDHHC enzymes and transfer of the fatty acyl chain from this intermediate to a protein substrate (60). In mammals, the zDHHC enzyme family consists of 24 proteins, and zDHHC proteins are also found in other eukaryotes but not in bacteria nor are they encoded by viral genomes. Mammalian zDHHC enzymes, each having at least four transmembrane helices, are located in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus (58). They display some specificity toward their protein substrates and also selectivity toward fatty acyl moieties other than palmitate, which contributes to the heterogeneity of lipids attached to proteins, such as viral glycoproteins described below (61). In the opposite process, the thioester bond is cleaved by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) (APT1 and APT2) and palmitoyl protein thioesterases (PPTs) (PPT1 and PPT2), which are localized in the cytosol and in lysosomes, respectively. APT1 and APT2 likely govern the dynamic functional changes of S-acylation of proteins (62) while PPT1 and PPT2 depalmitoylate proteins during their degradation (63, 64). Recently, serine hydrolases of the ABHD17 family have also been identified as depalmitoylating enzymes, and their specific substrate proteins determined (65, 66). Of note, the zDHHCs, APT1/APT2, and ABHD17 proteins are S-palmitoylated themselves, and palmitoylation of zDHHCs and depalmitoylation of APT1/2 can occur in a cascade manner (57, 62).\", \"The dynamic cycles of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation detected for several peripheral membrane proteins are often synchronized with intracellular trafficking of those proteins. They circulate between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus or endosomes, as exemplified by N- and H-Ras, R7-regulator of G protein and APTs. In fact, it is proposed that palmitoylation-dependent anchoring of APT1 in the plasma membrane allows it to depalmitoylate H-Ras at this location, while subsequent auto-depalmitoylation releases APT1 guiding it, alongside H-Ras, for another round of palmitoylation at the Golgi apparatus (62, 67–69). Cycles of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation are crucial for signaling by distinct plasma membrane receptors and for their distribution (69–71). Activation of TCR receptor or Fas receptor in T cells was found to trigger quick and transient palmitoylation of Lck kinase of the Src family (72, 73), but the exact meaning of the dynamic protein S-palmitoylation for processes triggered during the host–pathogen interaction awaits elucidation.\", \"It is worth mentioning that although the zDDHC enzymes catalyze bulk protein palmitoylation in eukaryotic cells (74), some proteins have a unique autopalmitoylation activity. These include Bet3, a component of a multisubunit transport protein particle complex involved in vesicular trafficking, TEA domain transcription factors, and also bacterial Evf protein (75–78). The palmitic acid residue is attached constitutively to a specific cysteine residue of those proteins, remains buried inside a hydrophobic pocked in their core thereby affecting the tertiary structure and, thus, interactions with other proteins (75, 77). An exhaustive discussion on the physiology of S-palmitoylated proteins in eukaryotic cells can be found in several recent reviews (46, 79, 80).\", \"It has been established that, in addition to palmitate, various other fatty acyl moieties, such as saturated stearate (C18:0) or monounsaturated palmitoleate (C16:1), and oleate (C18:1) can be attached via the thioester linkage to proteins. The early reports on the heterogeneity of the fatty acyl moieties attached to cysteines obtained by analysis of selected immunoprecipitated proteins (15, 16, 81–83) have recently been complemented by a comprehensive proteomic analysis of fatty-acylated proteins of macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14). The latter study showed that an enrichment of culture medium of cells with monounsaturated fatty acids leads to their incorporation into a similar set of proteins as those normally modified with palmitate. Among them, several proteins relevant to innate immune responses were found. All these data justify the use of a broader term S-acylation rather than S-palmitoylation (Table 1). The physiological consequences of S-acylation of proteins with individual fatty acids are slowly being revealed. Modification of Fyn kinase with polyunsaturated fatty acid residue, such as arachidonate (C20:4), disturbed its raft localization and, thereby, TCR signaling (15). A heterogeneity of S-acylation was also found in viral spike proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus, and E1 and E2 of Semliki Forest virus, which are modified in host eukaryotic cells by attachment of both palmitate and stearate (9). In HA, stearate is attached at the transmembrane cysteine while palmitate is attached to two cysteine residues in a membrane-proximal region of the protein. The stearoyl chain seems to accommodate into a groove formed by amino acids of the transmembrane helix shaping the domain in a way that facilitates its fitting into rafts (84). S-stearoylation of human transferrin receptor 1 at the juxtamembrane cysteine residues(s) is a key factor of the signaling cascade controlling mitochondrial morphology and functioning (13). Of interest, the latter study also showed that dietary supplementation of stearic acid reversed the deleterious effects of a genetically determined mitochondria dysfunction in Drosophila. Taking into account that unsaturated fatty acids affect the profile of S-acylation of proteins in vitro (14, 15), it is of outmost interest whether a similar effect of unsaturated and saturated (palmitic) fatty acids could be achieved in vivo with respect to proteins of immune cells.\", \"Beside S-acylation, less frequently palmitate can also be attached to the amine group of various amino acids (glycine, cysteine, and lysine) giving N-palmitoylation or to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine in a process called O-palmitoylation (Table 1). As during S-palmitoylation, also other fatty acids can be utilized in these processes named then N- and O-acylation. Thus, a type of protein N-acylation is N-myristoylation, a frequent modification contributing to membrane anchoring of peripheral proteins. The saturated myristate (C14:0) is transferred to the protein from myristoyl-CoA by N-myristoyl transferase (two isozymes in mammals). In a vast majority of cases, myristate is attached co-translationally to the N-terminal glycine residue (after removal of the initiator methionine) via an amide linkage (Table 1). Like most lipidations, this modification is irreversible. Several viral proteins are N-myristoylated, such as Gag of HIV-1 crucial for budding of newly formed virions from plasma membrane rafts of host cells, and proteins of parasitic protozoa Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania donovani (causing malaria, African sleeping sickness, and leishmaniosis, respectively). For this reason, N-myristoyl transferase is considered a potential drug target in the therapy of these diseases (17–19, 85, 86).\", \"Data on the N- and O-palmitoylation of proteins involved in the host–pathogen interactions are limited, but interesting conclusions can be drawn from the information concerning proteins taking part in other processes. N-palmitoylation of the N-terminal glycine of the α-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (Gαs) has been described (20) (Table 1) besides the well-known S-palmitoylation of this pivotal signaling protein. The N-palmitoylation of Gαs is irreversible, and the enzyme responsible for this modification is unknown. It has been speculated that S- to N-palmitoyl migration can occur both in vivo and also in vitro during mass spectrometry analysis (20, 87). This suggests that caution is needed in interpreting results of this methodological approach, which is used with increasing frequency to study fatty acylation of proteins in immune cells (see next sections). Probably the best-characterized is the N-palmitoylation of the N-terminal cysteine residue of hedgehog proteins (sonic, Indian, and desert in mammals). It determines secretion of these proteins, which regulate embryonic patterning (Table 1). Secreted Wnt and ghrelin proteins are examples of O-acylation of serine residues with unusual fatty acid residues such as palmitoleate (C16:1) and octaonoate (C8:0) (Table 1). The fatty acylation of hedgehog, Wnt, and ghrelin is catalyzed by enzymes from the multipass membrane-bound O-acyl transferases family (31). Besides these unusual fatty acid residues, attachment of palmitate to serine and threonine residues is found in secreted venom toxins of the spider Plectreurys tristis, which selectively target neuronal ion channels (88). Also histone H4 is O-palmitoylated at a serine residue in the nucleus by acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (25) (Table 1). The latter is of special interest in the context of innate immune responses since histone H4 O-palmitoylation regulates transcriptional activity, which is the final outcome of the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways triggered by receptors of the innate immune system.\", \"Special attention should be devoted to ε-N-acylation consisting in the attachment of a fatty acid residue to the side chain of lysine by amide linkage (Table 1). ε-N-myristoylated are interleukin 1α (IL-1α) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), the pro-inflammatory cytokines crucial in combating bacterial infections (22). The enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction is unknown, but it has been established that sirtuins reverse this modification (89). The ε-N-acylation affects the release of TNFα by immune cells (90, 91). Surprisingly, this rare modification is also found in toxins of so-called RTX (repeats-in-toxin) class released by some pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria (23, 24). We describe these cases in more detail in the following sections.\", \"Besides S-palmitoylation and N-myristoylation, S-prenylation is another common lipidation that endows proteins with a hydrophobic moiety and contributes to their association with membranes. This modification relies on the posttranslational and irreversible attachment of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl chains to a cysteine residue in the C-terminal CAAX box (alternatively also CC and CXC motifs) via a thioether linkage. The process is catalyzed by protein prenyl transferases that use polyprenylpyrophosphate as the donor of the isoprenoid group (Table 1). In peripheral membrane proteins, the S-palmitoylation site is often located in proximity of N-myristoylation or S-prenylation sites or a polybasic motif, which all are likely to mediate initial weak binding of a protein to a membrane and thereby facilitate subsequent attachment of palmitate to the protein by the integral membrane zDHHC enzymes (31). In contrast to S-palmitoylation, data on the role of S-prenylation of proteins key to the host–pathogen interactions are scarce (92). However, since S-prenylation is typical for the ubiquitous small GTPases of Ras superfamily, it is vital for proper functioning of B and T cells (93, 94).\", \"A glance at Table 1 indicates that palmitate can be covalently bound via oxyester, amide, and thioester linkages to respective amino acid residues creating an array of possible modifications. O- and N-palmitoylation of proteins seems to be stable, resembling in this regard the other common protein lipidations, N-myristoylation and S-prenylation. By contrast, there exist enzymes cleaving the thioester bond formed during S-palmitoylation. For a long time, our understanding of protein S-palmitoylation and its dynamics was poor in comparison with other reversible protein modifications due to technical difficulties. Only recently have these difficulties been overcome with the introduction of methods allowing high-throughput identification of palmitoylated proteins, also those involved in the immune response to microbial pathogens, as discussed in the next sections.\", \"In the click chemistry-based method, cells are metabolically labeled with a palmitic acid analog bearing an alkyne group at the ω carbon of the fatty acyl chain, such as 17-octadecynoic acid (17ODYA) or alk-16 (Figure 2A), and this step resembles the classic labeling of cells with [3H]-palmitic acid. However, in the click chemistry-based assay, the labeling and lysis of cells is followed by in vitro coupling of the function group of the palmitic acid analog to a reporter tag, which greatly enhances the sensitivity of detection of labeled proteins (98, 99). Thus, after cell lysis, the labeled proteins are subjected to Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition known as “click” reaction with an azide-bearing detection tag. In this step, a triazol is formed between the alkyne group in the palmitic acid analog and the azide of the tag (Figure 2A). The azide-bearing tags can be either fluorescent, such as tetramethylrhodamine or dyes with infrared fluorescence, or carry a biotin moiety. Depending on the tag used, subsequent SDS-PAGE separation of proteins allows global visualization of palmitoylated proteins by simple in-gel fluorescence or by blotting with a streptavidin-conjugated reporter (98, 101, 102). Notably, proteins biotinylated via the click reaction can also be enriched on streptavidin-coated beads and then subjected to on-bead tryptic digestion (or in-gel digestion if eluted from the beads) followed by identification by mass spectrometry. Such comprehensive click chemistry-based proteomic analysis has brought about identification of an array of palmitoylated proteins in dendritic cells (10, 103), macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14), and T cells (99, 104, 105). Some of the S-palmitoylated proteins newly identified in those studies, such as IFITM3 and TLR2, are involved in the host–pathogen interactions regulating innate immune responses (10, 103), while many others are known to contribute to adaptive immunity (99, 105), as described below. Recently, global profiling of Toxoplasma gondii (the causative agent of toxoplasmosis) has been performed revealing that many components of the parasite’s motility complex are palmitoylated (106). Similar studies on Cryptococcus neoformans (the fungus causing cryptococcal meningitis) have revealed a contribution of specific zDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase, called Pfa4, to its virulence (107). Moreover, application of analogs of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the fatty acylation of proteins in RAW264 cells and suggested that dietary unsaturated fatty acids, after incorporation to proteins, can change their properties and thereby affect the functioning of immune cells (14).\", \"The major advantage of the click chemistry-based method is that it can reveal the time course of protein S-palmitoylation. By using click chemistry-based labeling in the pulse-chase mode, one can follow the dynamics of protein palmitoylation. With such an approach, it was found that the palmitate turnover on Lck, an Src-family tyrosine kinase, is accelerated by T cell activation (72). Additional introduction of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cells (SILAC) has provided quantitative proteomic data on the dynamics of protein palmitoylation in the cell (104, 110). This approach revealed, rather unexpectedly, that in unstimulated T cell hybridoma, the palmitoylation of most protein species does not undergo turnover (104). Another advantage of the click chemistry-based assay is its high specificity, because the alkyne group introduced in the analog of palmitic acid is not normally found in cells (98, 102). The click chemistry-based methods can also be used to follow the cellular localization of palmitoylated proteins by immunofluorescence when combined with the proximity ligation technique (111, 112). Palmitoylation of individual proteins can also be studied after their immunoprecipitation (11, 72, 73, 98).\", \"Despite its unquestionable success, the click chemistry-based methods have limitations. They will detect only those proteins that undergo palmitoylation during the period of the metabolic labeling of cells. One should also bear in mind that the palmitic acid analog can be incorporated at S-, N-, and O-palmitoylation sites alike (111, 112). In addition, although 17ODYA (alk-16) is preferentially used to mimic palmitoylation of proteins, it can also be incorporated with low efficiency at N-myristoylation sites of proteins (98, 99). Another group of proteins that will be labeled with the palmitic acid analog but are not S-palmitoylated are those bearing the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (85, 113). Most of these limitations can be overcome using various fatty acid reporters, inhibitors, and by exploiting the sensitivity of the thioester bond to hydroxylamine treatment. Given the large variety of chemical reporters preferentially mimicking distinct fatty acids, recent years have witnessed a plethora of chemistry-based proteomic studies not only on palmitoylated but also myristoylated proteins and proteins bearing the GPI anchor, including those of pathogens and immune cells (10, 14, 85, 86, 114).\", \"The ABE method can be used as a complement to the click chemistry-based approach in cell studies but unlike the latter it is uniquely suitable for studying whole tissues. ABE does not require metabolic labeling of proteins in living cells, thus some of the abovementioned limitations and difficulties do not apply. The ABE method relies on in vitro exchange of thioester-linked palmitate to a derivative of biotin which allows subsequent affinity purification of the resulting biotin-labeled proteins on streptavidin-coated beads (Figure 2B). The first step of the ABE involves lysis of cells or tissues followed by irreversible blockage of free thiol groups in the solubilized proteins by alkylation, most often with N-ethylmaleimide. Subsequently, the thioester bonds existing in S-palmitoylated proteins are broken with hydroxylamine, releasing palmitoyl moieties. The newly exposed thiol groups can now be tagged with sulfhydryl-reactive derivatives, such as biotin-HPDP, forming disulfide bonds with thiols. The biotinylated proteins are subsequently captured on streptavidin-coated beads and eluted with agents that reduce the disulfide bond between the protein and biotin-HPDP, such as β-mercapthoethanol, DTT, or TCEP (49, 74, 115, 116). As an alternative to biotinylation, in the so-called acyl-RAC technique, the newly exposed protein thiol groups in hydroxylamine-treated cell lysates are captured on a resin containing sulfhydryl-reactive groups (117). In both ABE and acyl-RAC, the eluted proteins can be separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by gel staining or immunoblotting, or identified by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, when the hydroxylamine-released palmitoyl moieties are exchanged for a polyethylene glycol-maleimide derivative of a distinct molecular weight, a shift in-gel migration of tagged proteins is observed reflecting the number of fatty acyl residues originally S-bound to the protein (118, 119).\", \"The ABE method has so far been used successfully for proteomic profiling of S-acylated proteins in immune cells, such as RAW264 cells (48), several types of blood cells, such as platelets, primary T cells, and immortalized B cells (120–122), pathogenic microorganisms such as T. brucei and T. gondii (123, 124), and tissues (125, 126). To quantify the aberrations in protein palmitoylation in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease, whole animal stable isotope labeling of mammals (SILAM) was applied followed by tissue isolation and ABE procedure (127). In another approach, for quantitative analysis of the T-cell palmitoylome, ABE was combined with labeling of proteins with various oxygen isotopes during their digestion with trypsin before mass spectrometry analysis (122). In addition, preselection of tryptic peptides obtained by ABE on streptavidin-coated or sulfhydryl-reactive resins greatly facilitates the identification of S-acylation sites by mass spectrometry (49, 110, 117).\", \"Some aspects of the ABE method deserve a comment. Since the assay relies on the sensitivity of thioester bonds to hydroxylamine, ABE detects all S-acylation without distinguishing between S-palmitoylation and the other cases. Furthermore, there is a possibility of false-positive detection of proteins bearing a thioester linkage with compounds other than fatty acyl residues, such as ubiquitin in the E2 ubiquitin conjugase Ubc1 (115). Another source of false-positives is proteins in which free thiol groups were not completely alkylated before biotinylation. On the other hand, insufficient deacylation of bonafide fatty-acylated proteins with hydroxylamine results in their absence in the final sample (116).\", \"In summary, the click chemistry-based method relies on metabolic labeling of cells with a palmitic acid analog which incorporates into proteins and next tagging it with reporter molecules greatly enhancing the sensitivity of detection. It only reveals proteins undergoing S-palmitoylation during metabolic labeling of cells and allows revealing turnover of this modification. By contrast, the ABE method is based on direct binding of sulfhydryl-reactive derivatives to thiol groups of cysteines unraveled by hydroxylamine treatment after lysis of cells or tissues. It allows the investigation of the whole but static palmitoylome. A comparative proteomic study of protein palmitoylation in P. falciparum found that the sets of proteins identified using these two approaches overlapped in 57.2% (113), indicating that they provide complementary data on the cellular palmitoyl proteome. Thanks to the application of the click chemistry- and ABE-based methods numerous new palmitoylated proteins have been identified. In 2015, a SwissPalm database was launched, (128) which provides an excellent, manually curated resource of information on palmitoylated proteins, palmitoylation sites, etc., available at http://swisspalm.epfl.ch/. All these efforts have greatly furthered our knowledge on molecular mechanisms regulating diverse aspects of cell functioning, including host–pathogen interactions and progress of infectious diseases, as highlighted below.\", \"Bacteria lack protein palmitoyl acyltransferases of the zDHHC family and, therefore, are essentially devoid of S-palmitoylated proteins. Yet, they have developed unique mechanisms utilizing fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to modify their glycolipids and proteins. These modifications augment infectivity and help bacteria evade recognition by the host innate immune system. For example, the vast majority of Gram-negative bacteria produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a part of their outer membrane. LPS is composed of the variable polysaccharide O-antigen and more-conserved lipid A containing two glucosamine residues hexa-acylated with hydroxymyristic, myristic, and lauric acid. Lipid A is recognized by CD14 protein and TLR4 receptor complexed with MD2 protein on the plasma membrane of the host immune and some non-immune cells. Activation of TLR4 triggers strong pro-inflammatory reactions aiming at eradication of the bacteria, but when exaggerated, eventually leading to sepsis (129). Incorporation of an additional palmitoyl chain into lipid A markedly diminishes its ability to activate TLR4 and to induce the host pro-inflammatory responses, which is correlated with an increased survival of bacteria forming a biofilm (130, 131). This strategy is utilized among others by Salmonella typhimurium, a causative agent of gastroenteritis, by Bordetella bronchiseptica, a respiratory pathogen of human and other mammals, and by Yersinia pestis causing plague (132, 133). The formation of the extra-acylated LPS relies on the transfer of palmitate from phospholipids onto the hydroxymyristate chain at position 2 of glucosamine of lipid A. The reaction is catalyzed by lipid A palmitoyltransferases (PagP in Salmonella and its homologs in other bacteria) localized in the outer membrane of these pathogens (134, 135). In addition to causing steric hindrance preventing the binding to the TLR4/MD2 complex, the hepta-acylation of LPS also protects bacteria from the lytic activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides, most likely by reducing the fluidity of the bacterial outer membrane (136, 137).\", \"Apart from being incorporated into LPS in diverse bacteria, palmitate has also been found to modify a virulence factor of Gram-negative Erwinia carotovora, the Evf protein. The palmitoyl chain is linked via a thioester bond to the Cys209 residue at the center of Evf, plausibly by a self-palmitoylating activity of the protein. E. carotovora is a phytopatogen using insects such as Drosophila as vectors for dissemination between plants. The palmitoylation of Evf is required for infectivity of E. carotovora and its persistence in the insect gut, however, its mode of action of unknown. It has been speculated to be linked with an ability of Evf to associate with lipid bilayers, but the lack of similarities between Evf and any other bacterial protein of known function makes prediction on this subject difficult (79).\", \"A number of bacterial toxins of so-called RTX class released during infection of mammals by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria undergo ε-N-acylation of the side chain of internal lysines. These toxins include adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis, acylated with palmitic acid, and α-hemolysin of extraintestinal (uropathogenic) Escherichia coli, acylated with myristic acid and also 15- and 17-carbon fatty acids. The acylation is catalyzed by an endogenous bacterial acyltransferase which, unlike its eukaryotic counterparts, transfers the acyl chain not from acyl-CoA but from acyl-carrier protein. The acylated toxins secreted by the bacteria bind to the plasma membrane of the host cells, oligomerize and form pores causing cell lysis. In the case of the toxin of B. pertussis, essential is also the delivery of the adenylate cyclase moiety to the cell interior. Acylation is required for virulence possibly being involved in oligomerization of the toxins (23, 24, 138).\", \"Although lacking S-palmitoylated proteins (with the single known exception of Evf), bacteria express a wide range of membrane-bound proteins modified by a complex lipidation at the N-terminus, with palmitate frequently being a component of the lipid moiety (139, 140). The bacterial lipoproteins are synthesized in a multistep process catalyzed by a unique set of lipoprotein processing enzymes, Lgt, LspA, and Lnt, absent in eukaryotic cells. The formation of these lipoproteins begins with the attachment of a diacylglycerol via a thioester bond to a cysteine residue located in the so-called lipobox motif of the signal sequence of the transmembrane lipoprotein precursor. The signal sequence is then cleaved next to the lipid-modified cysteine leaving it at the N-terminus of the mature protein (141). In Gram-negative and less frequently also Gram-positive bacteria, a third fatty acid residue is additionally attached via an amide linkage to the amino group of the cysteine in a reaction analogous to the N-acylation of hedgehog proteins (see Table 1). This di- and tri-lipidation ensures membrane anchoring of the lipoproteins. All such lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria are exposed to the milieu while in Gram-negative bacteria some face the periplasm. The lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae (causing pneumonia), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis (meningitis), Y. pestis (plague), the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis) are crucial for their virulence. They control several aspects of the host–pathogen interactions, like adhesion and entry to host cells, protection against proteolysis and oxidative stress in the host cell, and regulation of expression of genes encoding cytokines both during initiation and progress of the disease (140–142). The surface exposure of the lipoproteins allows their involvement in the host cell invasion while on the other hand forming the so-called pattern signal recognized by the TLR2 receptor, which triggers the pro-inflammatory responses helping to combat the bacteria (143). Of interest, TLR2 is S-palmitoylated, as discussed below. The involvement of lipoproteins in pathogenesis fuels studies on their properties. One such recent work employing click chemistry to profile the lipoproteins of E. coli identified 88 lipoproteins with high/medium confidence, 70% of them predicted before by bioinformatics analysis (144). Notably, in that study a 14-carbon alkynyl fatty acid analog alk-14 rather than alk-16 was preferentially incorporated into the lipoproteins, contradicting earlier studies using gas chromatography and TLC, which found that palmitate was predominantly used for bacterial protein modification (139). Further studies are required to establish whether the fatty acid found in lipoproteins varies depending on culture conditions or is species specific. For example, 17ODYA labeling for click reaction confirmed incorporation of palmitate into pallilysin (Tp0751), a lipoprotein of T. pallidum. Pallilysin is a metalloprotease that degrades human fibrinogen and laminin. It is suggested that its exposure on the bacteria surface enables degradation of host structural proteins to facilitate rapid dissemination of this highly invasive pathogen (140).\", \"Bacteria occasionally high-jack the palmitoylation machinery of host cells to modify the environment so as to favor their internalization, survival, and replication inside the cells. Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) is an example of such bacteria that modify S-palmitoylation of host proteins to their ends. The anthrax toxin produced by this pathogen binds to the TEM8 and CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis protein-2) proteins which, under physiological conditions, are involved in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions. They are S-palmitoylated at multiple (two to four) cysteines (54). The S-palmitoylation of TEM8 was found to inhibit its association with plasma membrane rafts preventing its ubiquitination by the raft-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl. The binding of anthrax toxin drives association of the receptor-toxin complexes with rafts possibly correlated with depalmitoylation of the receptor. This allows subsequent ubiquitination of the receptor, an uptake of the receptor/toxin complexes in a clathrin-dependent manner and eventual delivery of the toxin to endosomes. These events are facilitated by S-palmitoylation of partner(s) of the receptors, most likely including kinases of the Src family (54, 145, 146).\", \"While B. anthracis utilizes palmitoylated host proteins to induce its internalization, a growing body of data suggests that also bacterial proteins can undergo S-palmitoylation inside the host cells. This type of modification concerns so-called effectors, bacterial proteins that are injected into the host cell cytoplasm either across the plasma membrane or the membrane of vesicles enclosing internalized pathogens, with the help of their secretion systems. These are secretion systems type III and type IV, homologs of which have been described for pathogens and symbionts of mammals, insects, and plants (147, 148). The bacterial effectors can be S-palmitoylated to reach host cell membranes and thereby accumulate at a location most suitable for their activity. Application of the click chemistry-based method utilizing an analog of palmitic acid (alk-16) for cell labeling has revealed S-palmitoylation of two effector proteins of Salmonella enterica, such as SspH2 and SseI (149). S. enterica invades gut endothelial cells and is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and typhoid fever. SspH2 carries an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain while SseI shows sequence homology to bacterial proteins that have a deamidase activity, and inhibits migration of Salmonella-infected cells. The latter activity requires S-palmitoylation of SseI. Both proteins are stably S-palmitoylated, most likely by zDHH3 and zDHH7 of the host and bind to the plasma membrane in a palmitoylation-dependent manner (149). Also two effector proteins of the IpaH family of Shigella spp. were found to be S-palmitoylated in that study, suggesting that this modification can control the activity of effector proteins of other pathogens as well (149). Indeed, GobX and LpdA, effector proteins of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease invading macrophages and lung endothelial cells, are S-palmitoylated as was found recently using click chemistry. LpdA is a phospholipase hydrolyzing various phosphatidylinositols while GobX is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. GobX is targeted in a palmitoylation-dependent manner to the Golgi apparatus, and LpdA to the plasma membrane and a subset of intracellular vesicles (150, 151). Thus, the diversified subcellular localization of bacterial effector proteins reflects that of eukaryotic proteins.\", \"It is worth noting that global profiling of acylated proteins with the application of click chemistry and an alkyne-functionalized analog of myristic acid, alk-14, for cell labeling was effective in reveling the mechanism of action of Shigella flexneri effector protein IpaJ of type III secretion system. This is a unique protease that cleaves off the N-terminal myristoylated glycine. This proteolytic demyristoylation activity of IpaJ is specific toward Golgi-associated ARF/ARL family of GTPases regulating cargo transport through the Golgi apparatus, inhibition of which is apparently pivotal for virulence of the bacteria causing diarrhea in humans (152).\", \"In addition to the S-palmitoylation of the effectors of pathogenic bacteria of mammals mentioned earlier, double acylation, N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation, has been reported of the so-called avirulence (Avr) proteins (effectors of type III secretion system) of Pseudomonas syringae, a causative agent of diverse plant diseases. Among them, AvrRpm1 and ArvB are N-myristoylated and S-palmitoylated by host acyltransferases at neighboring glycine and cysteine residues localized at the N-terminus of the proteins (similarly to eukaryotic kinases of the Src family), while in AvrPphB and two AvrPphB-like effectors—ORF4 and NopT, the double acylation motif is exposed after auto-cleavage of the proteins (similarly to some eukaryotic proteins cleaved by caspases). The acylation of the Avr proteins ensures their anchoring in the host plasma membrane, which is required for their functioning. In disease-susceptible plants Avr proteins contribute to successful infection; however, in plants expressing host resistance (R) genes they trigger plant defense signals, in both cases engaging plasma membrane-associated host proteins (153, 154).\", \"The importance of palmitoylation of bacterial effector proteins for their infectivity is only beginning to be uncovered, in no small part owing to the development of the click chemistry-based method for detection of this protein modification. However, the strategy of high-jacking the host palmitoylation machinery to modify own proteins seems to be much more commonly employed by viruses.\", \"Viruses do not encode palmitoyl acyltransferases but exploit extensively the host palmitoylation machinery to modify their proteins essential for infection of host cells and own replication. In fact, S-palmitoylation of proteins was discovered in 1979 as a modification of envelope glycoproteins of Sindbis virus and VSV. In those studies [3H]-palmitic acid was used for metabolic labeling of virus-infected cells and labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography (12, 155). Subsequently, a number of other viral proteins have been found to be palmitoylated using this approach.\", \"The most-studied group of viral palmitoylated proteins is those found in enveloped viruses, i.e., viruses covered by a lipid bilayer obtained during their replication from a membrane of the host cell, such as the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. Influenza virus, HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are the best known enveloped viruses. The envelope is rich in transmembrane, often S-palmitoylated, glycoproteins called spikes, which can bind to cognate receptors on the host cell plasma membrane triggering endocytosis of the virion, mediate subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes allowing entry of the viral genome to the cytoplasm, and are also involved in the budding of newly formed virus particles from the cell. An example of such multifunctional palmitoylated transmembrane glycoproteins is HA present in the envelope of influenza virus together with another palmitoylated transmembrane protein, the matrix protein M2, which forms a proton channel earning the protein the name viroporin. As mentioned earlier, HA of influenza A virus is S-stearoylated and S-palmitoylated, respectively, at one cysteine residue located in the transmembrane domain of HA and two cysteines found in the cytoplasmic (intraviral) tail in close proximity to the membrane (156). On the other hand, M2 is S-palmitoylated on the amphiphilic helix located in the cytoplasmic part of the protein. Due to the S-palmitoylation and the presence of a cholesterol-binding motif the helix bends toward and associates with membranes (157, 158). During infection, HA binds to sialic acid residues of glycans localized on the surface of airway and alveolar epithelial cells. The bound virions are endocytosed and next the viral and endosome membranes fuse. The membrane fusion is driven by HA, which undergoes conformational changes induced by low pH of endosomes. Acidification of endosomes activates also the M2 proton channel activity, protons entering viral core facilitate dissociation of the viral genome which then moves to the nucleus where RNA replication occurs. The S-palmitoylation of HA is required for the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes at least in some subtypes of the virus while the ion channel activity of M2 is not dependent on its S-palmitoylation (159). Newly synthesized viral proteins and RNA are assembled into virions in the plasma membrane rafts which merge into lager platforms crucial for the virion assembly and budding off. The triple fatty acylation of HA is required for its targeting to plasma membrane rafts (160, 161). Besides S-palmitoylation, also the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain of HA determines its association with rafts (45). On the other hand, among the amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of HA no other than the two S-palmitoylated cysteines are required for viral assembly and replication, although it is still not clear whether raft targeting (in cooperation with the transmembrane fragment) is the only mechanism of their participation. It is proposed that they affect conformation of the HA tail controlling its interaction with structural matrix protein M1 lying beneath the viral envelope (162, 163). The budding off of the virion is facilitated by M2 which localizes at the edges of rafts as a result of a combination of its S-palmitoylation, cholesterol binding, and properties of the transmembrane fragment. M2 protein can create a “wedge” altering membrane curvature thereby facilitating membrane scission and release of the virion (157, 164).\", \"The influenza virus S-palmitoylated proteins are the archetype for many other viral proteins. Thus, S-palmitoylated spike glycoproteins include S-protein of coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome virus), the fusion (F) protein of paramyxoviruses (e.g., measles virus), Env of retroviruses [e.g., HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)], and filoviruses (e.g., Ebola). Other viral proteins modified with palmitate are viroporins, such as E protein of coronaviruses, and also peripheral membrane proteins or nucleocapsid proteins absent in influenza virus. It has been found that S-palmitoylation of F13L, a peripheral protein of the envelope of vaccinia virus, controls the association of the protein with intracellular membranes, thereby the formation of the envelope (165). The core protein of the nucleocapsid of HCV resides on the surface of lipid droplets and binds in a palmitoylation-dependent manner to membranes of the droplet-associated endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, it recruits viral proteins and newly synthesized RNA for viral particle formation (166). Besides the interest in the role of viral protein S-palmitoylation for infectivity and possible use of host zDHHC enzymes as targets of anti-influenza drugs (167), viral proteins often serve as a model to study the consequences of fatty acylation for protein functioning and localization in distinct membrane domains (see S-Palmitoylation of Proteins and Its Influence on Protein Localization, Trafficking, and Stability of this review). Readers are referred to recent exhaustive reviews that consider these topics (36, 84, 168) while we will focus here on the recent advances in the field of viral protein palmitoylation brought about mainly by proteomic studies.\", \"The click chemistry-based approach has led to the identification of S-palmitoylation in the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane spike protein Env of FIV, considered to be the cat equivalent of HIV-1. Env comprises three transmembrane gp41 glycoproteins and three associated gp120 which bind to CD4 receptor and coreceptors on the surface of T lymphocytes allowing fusion of the viral envelope and the plasma membrane and entry of viral capsid. Four cysteines in FIV Env are S-palmitoylated vis-a-vis two found in the Env of HIV-1. The two most membrane-proximal cysteines, 804 and 811, are required for the FIV membrane-fusion activity and incorporation of Env into virions (169), in agreement with the importance of Env S-palmitoylation for virion assembly of some HIV-1 strains (170–172). The assembly of HIV-1 virions takes place in plasma membrane rafts and is driven by N-myristoylated Gag protein which anchors and oligomerizes preferentially in these plasma membrane domains due to the presence of the fatty acyl chain (18).\", \"The development of click chemistry-based methods allowed for the first time global profiling of acylated proteins in virus-infected cells. In addition to identifying acylated viral proteins this approach has also revealed how the viral infection modulates the acylation pattern of the host cell proteins. Thus far, click chemistry has been used to study protein myristoylation and palmitoylation in cells infected with HIV-1 and with HSV. In the latter case, the standard metabolic labeling with alkyne-functionalized myristic and palmitic acid analogs followed by click chemistry and mass spectrometry was combined with SILAC to discern between the changes in the extent of protein acylation and those in their abundance following viral infection. This approach allowed an elaborate quantitative analysis of host protein acylation and has revealed an overall downregulation of the level of both host protein modifications in infected cells. While the decreased content of myristoylated proteins resulted mainly from suppression of host protein synthesis, the drop in several S-palmitoylated proteins ensued from the inhibition of their palmitoylation in infected cells. The affected proteins were localized mainly to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus and were involved in vesicle-mediated transport and ion transport. In addition, the study has expanded the list of HSV-encoded acylated (mostly palmitoylated) proteins that play different functions in the viral cycle, such as gE, gI, gK, US2, and US3 (110). Similar results pointing to global changes of host protein acylation were obtained upon analysis of protein myristoylation and palmitoylation in cells infected with HIV-1. In that study, the cells were labeled with analogs of palmitic or myristic acid tagged with an azide moiety for click chemistry reaction; however, the following mass spectrometry analysis did not address the relation between changes of protein acylation vs. alteration of protein level. The study identified 17 palmitoylated and 7 myristoylated proteins significantly differing in abundance between HIV-1 infected and uninfected cells. Several of the proteins affected by the infection were of host origin. The abundance of myristoylated proteins was in general increased while that of the palmitoylated ones—decreased in infected cells (173). In other words, the two studies have revealed that HSV and HIV-1 not only encode proteins that are acylated in the host cell but also alter the palmitoylation of host proteins, likely to adapt the cellular environment to favor their replication and budding. The majority of the acylated proteins affected by HIV-1 or HSV infection had not been described earlier in this context; therefore, further studies on these proteins could be crucial for better understanding of viral infection. Thus, the click chemistry-based approach has been highly effective in revealing changes of the host protein palmitoylation and opening new possibilities for the identification of novel antiviral drug targets.\", \"The innate immune responses are the first line of active defense against microbial infections. The application of click chemistry-based and ABE methods and their use for large-scale analysis of protein palmitoylation in murine dendritic CD2.4 cells (10, 103), and murine macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14, 48) complemented by proteomic analysis of the raft fraction of those cells (47) have contributed significantly to the understanding of the role of palmitoylation of host receptors and signaling proteins involved in innate immune responses. Thus, the palmitoyl proteome analysis of murine dendritic cells unraveled S-palmitoylation of TLR2, a receptor expressed in cells of myeloidal lineage, which heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to bind bacterial tri- or diacylated lipoproteins, respectively, and also other microbial components, such as glycolipids (e.g., lipoarabinomannan) of Mycobacterium and yeast zymosan (174). Besides TLR2, two other human TLRs out of 10 ectopically expressed in HEK293 cell, flagellin receptor TLR5, and TLR10, a unique TLR negatively regulating the pro-inflammatory activity of TLR2, were also found to be palmitoylated. The S-palmitoylation site of human TLR2 was mapped to Cys609 adjacent to its transmembrane domain. The modification was present in unstimulated cells and was linked with up-regulation of the cell surface localization of TLR2. Mutation of Cys609 abolished the ability of the receptor to induce pro-inflammatory signaling in response to microbial ligands of TLR2 (10). Further studies are needed to reveal whether S-palmitoylation of TLR2 controls its association with rafts as sites of TLR2 activation (175) and/or affects endocytosis of the receptor, as found for the anthrax toxin receptor (54).\", \"One of the most extensively studied TLRs, TLR4 activated by bacterial LPS, is not palmitoylated. Yet, saturated fatty acids have been indicated to trigger pro-inflammatory signaling of TLR4. Thus, the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex is involved in the pro-inflammatory outcome of a diet rich in palmitic acid, as was found when analyzing markers of inflammation in the heart and adipose tissue of high fat diet-fed mice (176, 177). The molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory properties of palmitic acid can involve its influence on the plasma membrane lipid order, hence raft organization, in a way that facilitates translocation of TLR4 (and TLR2) toward rafts (178, 179). Palmitic acid also directly binds to the TLR4-associated MD2 protein (177, 180). An influence of palmitic acid on sphingomyelin/ceramide metabolism, which enhances the LPS-induced responses, has also been considered (181). Recent proteomic studies based on 17ODYA labeling of RAW264 macrophage-like cells followed by click chemistry have revealed that stimulation of cells with LPS induces profound changes of the abundance of palmitoylated proteins (182). The data are in agreement with earlier findings showing that LPS induces accumulation of S-palmitoylated Lyn kinase in the raft-enriched fraction of cells, allowing it to downregulate TLR4 signaling (11). One of the upregulated S-palmitoylated proteins was type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIβ, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. It was shown that palmitoylation determines the involvement of the kinase in LPS-induced signaling (182). These data suggest that S-palmitoylated proteins, including enzymes catalyzing phosphatidylinositol synthesis and turnover, are important factors affecting the pro-inflammatory responses triggered by LPS.\", \"Notably LPS induces production of TNFα, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is S-palmitoylated itself. TNFα is synthesized as a transmembrane 27-kDa precursor (tmTNFα) transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus and recycling endosomes (183). Human tmTNFα is S-palmitoylated at Cys30 located at the boundary between its transmembrane and cytosolic fragments, as was found independently by radiolabeling and by labeling with 17ODYA followed by click chemistry (184, 185). Poggi et al. (185) arrived at a complex model explaining how the S-palmitoylation of TNFα affects its activity (Figure 3A). The modification was shown to favor the association of tmTNFα with rafts. Upon cell activation, the extracellular domain of tmTNF is cleaved by ADAM17 metalloproteinase whereupon the soluble TNFα (sTNFα) is released to the extracellular milieu and activates TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2. As ADAM17 localizes to both non-raft and raft regions of the plasma membrane, the S-palmitoylation of tmTNFα does not affect its cleavage and production of the soluble cytokine. However, S-palmitoylated tmTNFα interacts with TNFR1 in rafts thereby reducing the binding of sTNFα and consequently reducing the sensitivity of the cell to this cytokine. In addition, the fragment of tmTNFα which remains after the release of sTNFα in rafts if further processed by intramembrane SPPL2a and 2b proteases giving rise to ICD (intracellular domain) of an own biological activity. By contrast, the non-raft fragment of the ADAM17-cleaved tmTNFα is rapidly degraded (185).\", \"The transport and maturation of TNFα are also regulated by another posttranslational acylation, ε-N-myristoylation (22). As shown in Figure 3B, myristic acid residues are attached to two lysines (Lys19 and 20) of human tmTNFα. This modification is reversed by sirtuin 6 catalyzing the demyristoylation. Depletion of sirtuin 6 decreases the release of sTNFα since the ε-N-acylated TNFα precursor is redirected to and accumulates in lysosomes (90, 91). It is worth noting that exogenous palmitic acid stimulates the ε-N-myristoylation of tmTNFα, thereby reducing the release of sTNFα in favor of accumulation of tmTNFα in lysosomes (90, 91). This somehow surprising anti-inflammatory effect of palmitic acid can be explained by competitive binding between long-chain fatty acids (in this case, palmitic) and myristoylated substrates of sirtuin 6 found in vitro—(89) and adds a new dimension to the potential effects of palmitic acid.\", \"S-palmitoylation of host proteins is also vital in antiviral defense. Viral nucleic acids, which are recognized by several TLRs and also cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors, induce robust production of type I interferons (IFNs), mainly INFα and IFNβ. The IFNα and IFNβ released from cells which first encounter viruses, e.g., dendritic cells, induce an antiviral reaction in an autocrine and paracrine manner upon binding to plasma membrane IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) consisting of subunits 1 and 2. Both human IFNAR subunits are S-palmitoylated, as has been found by classical radiolabeling. The S-palmitoylation of IFNAR1 on Cys463, localized near the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane domain, is required for downstream activation of STAT1 and STAT2 and the following transcription of IFNα-activated genes (186). Among the IFN-induced proteins, some have been shown to be palmitoylated, using click chemistry and ABE. They include the immunity-related GTPase Irgm1, BST2 also known as tetherin, and IFITM1 and 3 (10, 104). IFITMs are potent restriction factors against a wide range of enveloped viruses, e.g., influenza, West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses (187, 188). IFITMs localize primarily to endolysosomal membranes where they inhibit viral replication by blocking their fusion with these membranes and also facilitate virus degradation (187). The exact mechanism of this antiviral activity is not clear, but it seems to rely on a perturbation of the organization of endolysosomal membranes. This can be linked with the intramembrane topology of IFITMs and their S-palmitoylation. IFITM1 and 3 likely possess two loops embedded in but not spanning the membrane with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasm (55, 189). S-palmitoylation of conserved cysteine residues adjacent to these loops, Cys71, 72, and 105 in murine IFITM3, contributes to the membrane binding, similarly as found earlier for caveolins (119, 189). The S-palmitoylation also facilitates clustering of IFITM3 in the membranes, which is of potential significance for its antiviral activity (103). In support of the latter, the antiviral capacity was markedly reduced for non-palmitoylated mutant forms of IFITM3 (103, 119). However, S-palmitoylation did not affect the endolysosomal localization or stability of IFITM3. Subsequent studies have revealed that the localization and degradation of murine IFITM3, both shaping its antiviral capacity, are orchestrated by numerous posttranslational modifications comprising polyubiquitination, tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src-family kinase Fyn, and methylation (189, 190). By contrast, S-palmitoylation alone of the closely related murine IFITM1 endowed it with an antiviral activity and enhanced stability by preventing proteasomal degradation (55), which indicates diverse effects of this modification on individual IFITM isoforms.\", \"The presented data are only beginning to fill the gap which existed in our understanding of the role of protein palmitoylation in innate immune responses. For a long time, it was lagging behind that on acquired immune responses, in which a plethora of S-palmitoylated proteins have long been known to be involved. They include receptors (CD4 and CD8), tyrosine kinases of the Src family, transmembrane adaptor proteins (e.g., LAT, NTAL, and PAG/Cbp), and α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Their S-palmitoylation in most cases targets them to rafts and is a prerequisite for their involvement in the signaling pathways triggered by immunoreceptors [TCR, B cell receptor (BCR), and Fcγ and Fcε receptors] crucial for the acquired immune responses. An association of some components of these signaling pathways with tetraspanin-enriched domains has also been considered. These topics are discussed in several earlier reviews (44, 79, 191, 192). It is worth noting that large-scale proteomic analyses of fatty-acylated proteins of T cells (99, 104, 105, 122) and B cells (121), identifying numerous new palmitoylated proteins, have been published recently. Further studies will shed light on the possible engagement of those proteins in acquired immune responses and/or in the cross talk between the innate and the acquired immune system, in which phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are essential (193).\", \"Protein S-palmitoylation affects their localization, trafficking, and stability. It has long been known as an important factor controlling signal transduction by the BCR and TCR receptors involved in acquired immune responses. It is now becoming evident that palmitic acid is also a key lipid affecting the diverse processes at the host–pathogen encounter. Palmitate is a component of bacterial LPS and lipoproteins; S-palmitoylation of viral, some bacterial, and numerous host proteins is recognized as a crucial factor affecting both the virulence of pathogens and the innate immune reactions of the host. Our understanding of the latter has benefited greatly from the development of novel methods of detection of this protein modification. Their application has led to the identification of numerous proteins involved in the host–pathogen interaction. The methods have also allowed high-throughput proteomic analysis of palmitoylation of proteins in infected cells, showing widespread changes of the host cell palmitoylome. Future studies will tell whether complex feedback loops comprising palmitoyl acyltransferases and acylthioesterases, similar to those of kinases and phosphatases carrying out protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, are involved in controlling protein S-palmitoylation in infected cells. Revealing how the S-palmitoylation of particular proteins is regulated during the host–pathogen interactions should allow its modulation to favor the host defense.\", \"All authors contributed to

reactivation of latent Mtb infection are not well understood, but likely involve contributions from both the host and the pathogen. To appreciate the role that the host immune system plays in Mtb reactivation, we used relatively resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (CBA/J) mice, whose susceptibility phenotype is most apparent during late stages of infection, to represent differences in the natural progression of TB between different human populations. CBA/J mice have low numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells that produce relatively small amounts of IFN-γ [1]–[4]. CBA/J mice also have elevated amounts of IL-10 during Mtb infection [5], [6], contributing to their increased susceptibility to infection. However, the importance of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in this mouse strain remains unclear.\", \"CD8+ T cells are an important component of the protective immune response to Mtb, as defined by studies showing that mice deficient in CD8+ T cells had impaired control of Mtb infection [7]–[10]. Although there is no consensus on the specific requirement for CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection, CD8+ T cells can contribute to Mtb control by secretion of IFN-γ [11], [12] and cytotoxic lysis of host cells [13], [14], yet their ability to maintain maximal effector function is dependent on CD4+ T cells [15]–[17]. Studies have also reported that CD8+ T cells are most important during latent Mtb infection in mice, and that CD8+ T cell depletion early after infection had little effect on disease outcome [18]. Conversely, other studies suggest that CD8+ T cells are dispensable during Mtb infection [19]–[21].\", \"In chronic viral infection models, CD8+ T cells can become dysfunctional after chronic antigenic stimulation, characterized by a lack of functional or proliferative capability, secretion of IL-10 [22]–[24] and surface expression of inhibitory molecules, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (Tim-3) [25], [26]. PD-1 has classically been used as a marker of T cell exhaustion in viral infection and in cancer [27]–[30], while other studies have found that cells expressing Tim-3 are dysfunctional and lack regulation [31], [32], and that coexpression of PD-1 and Tim-3 leads to extensive dysfunction of CD8+ T cells [33]. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (the β subunit of the IL-2 receptor) have been shown to have suppressive qualities and secrete IL-10 [34]. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that Mtb susceptibility in CBA/J mice is mediated by excessive pulmonary IL-10 during infection [1], [2], [5], [35], [36], yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although numerous cell types are capable of producing IL-10, studies have previously shown that IL-10-producing T cells can actively suppress the immune response in TB patients [37], supporting an investigation into the IL-10-producing properties of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in CBA/J mice.\", \"In this study we show that Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mice accumulated large numbers of CD8+ T cells in their lungs as Mtb infection progressed that could not be fully accounted for by an expansion of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cell expansions expressed the inhibitory molecules PD-1, Tim-3, and/or CD122, and were capable of secreting IL-10. CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice also preferentially expressed TcR Vβ8 and Vβ14, severely limiting the diversity of the CD8+ T cell repertoire. Although Vβ8 CD8+ T cells could secrete IL-10, in vivo depletion of this specific T cell clonal population during chronic infection did not overtly change the Mtb burden in the lungs in the timeframe tested, although the amount of IL-10 in the lung was reduced indicating some biological impact of depletion. Comparing mouse strains that are relatively resistant and susceptible to Mtb has enabled us to uncover a previously unappreciated role for CD8+ T cells in Mtb susceptibility, and links the poor T cell function previously described by us [4], [6], [36] with increased production of IL-10 in the CBA/J mouse strain.\", \"This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

To generate CBA/J IL-10−/− mice, CBA/J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were crossed with C57BL/6 IL-10−/− mice (Jackson) for eight generations. At each cross progeny mice were ear-punched and DNA was screened for the presence of a neomycin cassette at the il10 gene locus. IL-10+/− mice were selected for further breeding.

In contrast to the reduced number of CD4+ T cells, CBA/J mice demonstrated a significant late accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs as Mtb infection progressed (\\nFig. 1b\\n), eventually reaching or surpassing the number of pulmonary CD8+ T cells observed in C57BL/6 mice. This late accumulation was absent from C57BL/6 mice which reached a plateau at day 60. Skewing of T cell subset proportions in CBA/J mice could be better appreciated by determination of CD4∶CD8 ratios throughout the course of infection (\\nFig. 1c\\n), where a significant decline in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was observed by day 90 of Mtb infection, preceding the increasing CFU within the lungs of CBA/J mice (\\nFig. 1d\\n) [4], [6]. BrdU staining of pulmonary CD4+ (\\nFig. 1e\\n) and CD8+ T (\\nFig. 1f\\n) cells from CBA/J mice was not dramatically altered throughout infection, suggesting that the increased numbers of CD8+ T cells that were evident in CBA/J mice may not be due to local proliferation, but a consequence of enhanced cellular recruitment. CBA/J mice are known to produce abundant IL-10 in their lungs as Mtb infection progresses [5] and IL-10 can stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ T cells [41]. Therefore, we examined the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in the lungs of CBA/J IL-10−/− mice over the course of Mtb infection (\\nFig. 1g, h\\n) and did not observe any differences between wild-type and IL-10−/− CBA/J mice in CD8+ T cell accumulations at late stages of infection, demonstrating that CD8+ T cell expansions occur independent of IL-10. A significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10−/− mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced TH1 immunity in these mice (unpublished observations). These data demonstrate that the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10.\", \"We examined the number of T cells that were capable of secreting IFN-γ after ex vivo TcR stimulation. As expected, C57BL/6 mice had increasing numbers of CD4+\\n[4] and CD8+ T cells that could produce IFN-γ as infection progressed (\\nFig. 2a\\n), which paralleled the increasing numbers of T cells within the lung (\\nFig. 1\\n). CBA/J showed an equivalent increase in IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells (\\nFig. 2b\\n), albeit at a significantly lower number compared to C57BL/6, as we have previously described [3], [4]. Where the data differed, however, was in the finding that the number of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells reached a plateau as early as day 30 post-infection and did not increase any further, despite a significant accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs of CBA/J mice. As Mtb infection progressed we also observed a significant increase in the number of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice that could express CD69 (\\nFig. 2c\\n), with over 40% of all CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice being activated during chronic infection. CD8+ T cells also expressed the suppressor of TH1 responses Tim-3 (\\nFig. 2d\\n), PD-1 (\\nFig. 2e\\n), with a small population expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (\\nFig. 2f\\n). Therefore, although highly activated, a proportion of CD8+ T cell expansions from chronic Mtb infected CBA/J mice had a phenotype that was not associated with TH1 cytokine secretion but was instead linked to immuno-suppressive properties including IL-10 production [34]. Because IL-10 production has been closely linked to Mtb susceptibility of CBA/J mice [5], we next examined the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10.\", \"CD8+ and CD8neg cells were purified from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice and cultured in IL-10 ELISpot plates for 72 hours with autologous bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) that had been infected with Mtb for 24 hours, in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. CD8+ cells from CBA/J mice, and not C57BL/6 mice, were capable of secreting IL-10 in response to TcR cross-linking (\\nFig. 3a\\n). In contrast, CD8neg cells from both mouse strains were capable of secreting IL-10 under these same conditions (\\nFig. 3b\\n). IL-10-secreting CD8neg cells were predominantly CD4+ as adherent cells were removed during cell purification and we have failed to detect IL-10 within B cells and neutrophils in both mouse strains (not shown). We also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice were capable of secreting IFN-γ under the same culture conditions (measured in the IL-10 ELISPOT supernatants) (\\nFig. 3c\\n). Culture of purified CD8+ and CD8neg cells from Mtb infected CBA/J mice with Mtb-infected BMDCs in the absence of TcR cross-linking, indicative of an Mtb-specific response, resulted in the secretion of IL-10 from both CD8neg and CD8+ cells (\\nFig. 3d\\n). Interestingly, the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10 increased over time, in parallel to the increasing CFU and CD8+ T cell numbers in the lung. The low SFU, relative to TcR cross-linking likely reflects the challenges of delivering of Mtb antigen into the appropriate processing pathway for presentation to CD8+ T cells.\", \"We determined the clonal repertoire of the CD8+ T cells that accumulated in the lungs of CBA/J mice during Mtb infection to determine whether the reactivity of CD8+ T cells was potentially driven by a dominant antigen, a concept supported by the finding of T cell clonal expansions in TB patients [42], [43]. At late stages of Mtb infection, we observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice primarily expressed two variable regions of the TcR beta chain (Vβ). Vβ8 (8.2,8.3) and Vβ14 were expressed by approximately 45% of all CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection, compared to a less restrictive repertoire in C57BL/6 mice (\\nFig. 4a\\n). Vβ expression was comparable on CD4+ T cells from both mouse strains (\\nFig. 4b\\n), indicating a unique expansion within the CD8+ T cell pool in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progressed. More detailed examination over the course of Mtb infection showed that the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing Vβ8 or Vβ14 was always significantly higher throughout Mtb infection in CBA/J mice, and this population significantly expanded further at late time points of Mtb infection (\\nFig. 4c, d\\n). Similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell expansions, we found that both Vβ8 and Vβ14 CD8+ T cells were highly activated (\\nFig. 4e\\n).\", \"We determined the IL-10 producing capacity of CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells using magnetic bead separation, which purified the dominant Vβ8 expressing CD8+ population. CD8+ Vβ8+ and CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells were isolated from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice or C57BL/6 mice (controls) at day 150 post Mtb infection and cultured in IL-10 ELISpot plates with autologous IL-10 deficient BMDCs in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28. Significantly more CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were capable of producing IL-10 than CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells from CBA/J mice or from CD8+ Vβ8+ and CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells from C57BL/6 mice (\\nFig. 4f\\n). These data indicate a dominant role for CD8+ Vβ8+ expressing T cells in the IL-10 production we previously observed in purified CD8+ T cell cultures. Culture supernatants were also assayed for IFN-γ by ELISA (\\nFig. 4g\\n) and our data indicate that CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells can have dual secretion of IL-10 and IFN-γ, or represent a mixed population, as has been described by others [44].\", \"CD8+ T cells or Vβ8+ cells were depleted from wild-type CBA/J mice from day 90–120 after Mtb infection, a time when IL-10 and Vβ8+ CD8+ T cells were increasing in the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice [5]. Following CD8+ depletion, Mtb CFU (\\nFig. 5a\\n), total CD4+ T cell numbers (\\nFig. 5b\\n) and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells (\\nFig. 5c\\n) were all moderately altered but data did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, CD8+ T cell depletion led to a significant decrease in the total amount of IL-10 in the lungs of CBA/J mice (\\nFig. 5d\\n), reflecting the IL-10-secreting capacity of CD8+ T cells we observed in vitro. Depletion of CD4+ T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden and mortality before day 120 (not shown) showing that depletion of a known protective T cell subset increased susceptibility. Specific depletion of Vβ8+ cells also failed to significantly impact the Mtb burden (\\nFig. 5e\\n), although a modest reduction in CFU was similarly observed. This modest reduction, similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell depletion, suggests that although IL-10 producing CD8+ T cells may not negatively impact the growth of Mtb during the timeframe we investigated, they do not provide protection.\", \"We have demonstrated that clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice accumulate in the lung over the course of Mtb infection. This accumulation did not yield an equivalent increase in IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and, upon further phenotypic examination, we discovered that highly activated CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice expressed the T cell dysfunction markers PD-1 and Tim-3, as well as co-expression of PD-1 and CD122 suggesting possible immunosuppressive activity. After ex vivo purification and culture, it was shown that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice were capable of secreting IL-10 after TcR stimulation and in response to Mtb infected BMDCs. Depletion of Vβ8+ cells or the entire CD8+ T cell population in Mtb-infected CBA/J mice led to a significant reduction in pulmonary IL-10 levels, however, we observed no significant change in pulmonary CFU.\", \"Using an Mtb-susceptible mouse strain, we reveal that CD8+ T cells that are capable of producing IL-10 can accumulate within the lung during Mtb infection. CD8+ T cells within the lung expressed CD69, indicative of activation and functional capacity, yet failed to show a concomitant enhancement of IFN-γ-producing capacity. These findings indicate that highly activated CD8+ T cells within the lung have alternate function, which we show here to be the capacity to secrete IL-10, measured by ELISPOT due to the known difficulties of measuring IL-10 by intracellular flow cytometry. Altered function was associated with the co-expression of a variety of receptors know for negative regulation of cell function (PD-1, CD122, Tim-3) [25], [28], [33], [34]. In support of our findings, previous studies have shown that in chronic murine Mtb infection PD-1+ T cells can proliferate but fail to secrete IFN-γ unless this inhibition is overcome by direct TcR stimulation [45], [46]. It is unclear at this time why CD8+ T cells with inhibitory properties arise in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progresses but we can hypothesize that this is a consequence of enhanced immune activation and subsequent exhaustion due to increasing bacterial loads in this mouse strain (Fig. 1) [4], [6].\", \"Our failure to observe any significant change in CFU following CD8+ or Vβ8+ T cell depletion can be interpreted in several ways, the simplest being that IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells have no biological influence on the control of Mtb infection. While this is a possibility, we would reason that at the least the presence of IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells can be a putative biomarker of TB disease progression as they are only observed in a mouse strain of Mtb susceptibility, and IL-10 producing T cells have been previously described in the blood of TB patients [37]. In support of a negative role for CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice, in vivo depletion led to a moderate, albeit not significant, decrease in CFU. Thus is in contrast to CD4+ T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point (data not shown). These findings indicate that some CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice fail to contribute to protection in a similar manner than might be expected from studies of other mouse strains [47]–[49]. One possibility for our failure to detect significant changes in CFU following CD8+ T cell depletion is our observation that CD8+ T cells can secrete both IL-10 and IFN-γ. Depletion of all CD8+ T cells would also remove a protective population, leading to a neutral effect. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that blocking the action of IL-10 in CBA/J mice during Mtb infection provides enhanced protection [5], and we consider that blocking the action of IL-10 from IL-10/IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells contributed to this phenotype.\", \"In addition to IL-10 production, we also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice had severely restricted diversity of their TcR repertoire which would significantly limit the breadth of antigens that CBA/J CD8+ T cells can recognize. CBA/J mice have an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV-6) that selectively deletes various TcR Vβ chains such as Vβ8.1, and Vβ 17a [50], [51] however this alone is not sufficient to explain the limited TcR diversity in CBA/J mice. It is possible that Mtb infection leads to specific deletion of certain subsets of protective CD8+ T cells or is driving clonal expansion of less protective cells (Vβ8, Vβ14). Alternatively Vβ8/Vβ14 CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice may respond to a dominant Mtb antigen(s) expressed in vivo, where persistent responsiveness leads to immune exhaustion and subsequent regulation through receptors such as PD-1 and Tim-3. Clonal CD8+ expansions have been described in TB patients [52], including pediatric TB [42], supporting the relevance of our findings to TB in man. Clonal CD8+ expansions are also common in the elderly and in many viral models [42], [43], [53]–[58], yet their importance in Mtb infection is still unclear.\", \"In summary, we show using an Mtb-susceptible mouse strain (CBA/J) that clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-10 can arise during chronic Mtb infection. In combination with our previous finding that blocking the action of IL-10 can improve outcome of Mtb infection [5], these data further support a negative role for IL-10 in the generation and maintenance of protective immunity against Mtb infection. Our findings are of significance because vaccines that specifically stimulate CD8+ T cells are currently under development [59]–[63]. Given that IL-10-secreting CD8+ T cells with the potential to negatively impact control of Mtb infection can naturally arise, generating such cells in response to vaccination should be considered.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n        \"0,9\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,10\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,11\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,25\": \"problem\",\n        \"0,26\":

New viral diseases have been reported continuously with severe health issues, and the lack of effective antiviral treatment makes them more severe (Kapoor et al. 2017). Most of the viral diseases like influenza, HIV, and chikungunya and other diseases caused by alphaviruses and flaviviruses are emerging with the great risk. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected world’s population severely. Nowadays, the development of effective treatment and antivirals against virus has become difficult, due to the ability of viruses to mutate their genome and become resistant to drugs (Irwin et al. 2016). Moreover, the antiviral drugs also exhibit adverse side effects, which directly and indirectly affect the human health. This leads towards the development of plant-based drugs and herbal treatments with minimal side effects (Biswas et al. 2019). Human depends on the traditional plants to fulfill their basic necessities. Plant-based anti-infection treatments are attracting the focus of modern world healthcare researchers, because of the minimal side effects with effective health benefits. Over the past few years, plant-based drug discovery has been continuously evaluated for its antibacterial, antiviral, anticancerous, and antioxidant activities (Biswas et al. 2019; Lillehoj et al. 2018). Moreover, the antiviral activities of plant-based compounds have been evaluated for emerging viral diseases. Plant-based antiviral natural compounds are the most suitable and best alternative of antiviral medicines/inhibitors/drugs, because of less toxicity (Lillehoj et al. 2018). Plant-based potential bioactive compounds, having antiviral properties have been proved superior, and could be combined with the preexisting therapies, along with the different delivery methods to enhance the effectiveness of antiviral along with good bioavailability (Kapoor et al. 2017).\", \"Viruses possess DNA or RNA genome with protein envelops, and depend on the host metabolism and environment to replicate and survive. They exploit the cellular machinery of host and disseminate throughout the body (Helenius 2018). Viruses have the ability to invade and adopt evasion strategies, which is an important challenge during the development of antivirals. Since the plants have metabolites/chemicals with variety of properties, they could be evaluated and used to counter the evasion and drug-resistance difficulties related with the antivirals, and thus will inhibit the viral dissemination (Irwin et al. 2016). There are several mechanisms, which govern the antiviral activity of phytochemicals. For instance, few of the antiviral phytochemicals, which bind to carbohydrate moiety tend to target the cell entry (Idris et al. 2016). This approach limits the viral penetration, resists its coating, and eventually inhibits the growth of viruses. Additionally, some of the compounds directly inhibit viral replication and hence prevent its propagation (Kapoor et al. 2017). Herein, we will focus on the plant-based antivirals reported to inhibit viral replication and the mode of their action.\", \"Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary compounds of plants with several properties, such as anticancerous, antimicrobial, and antiviral. Flavonoids are widely present in many fruits, seeds, and vegetables as a result of abiotic stress (Carletti et al. 2014; Zakaryan et al. 2017). Flavonoids are being constantly researched upon for antiviral activities (Jacob and Thomas 2019). EGCG is one of the flavonoids, and is an important component of green tea. It has been reported to have antiviral activity against rotavirus strain SA-11 (Lipson et al. 2017). Zakaryan et al. reported baicalein, another flavonoid (flavone), having antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Baicalein is also reported for the inhibition of different stages of the replication of dengue virus. Fisetin and quercetagetin fall under the category of flavonols, and are exploited for their antiviral activities (Zakaryan et al. 2017). Fisetin was successfully reported to inhibit the replication of dengue virus and enterovirus A71 in vitro (Min et al. 2018). The inhibition of hepatitis C virus and the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection was done by the activity of quercetagetin (Zakaryan et al. 2017). Moreover, baicalein, quercetagetin, and fisetin were also reported for the inhibition of chikungunya virus by impeding the intracellular viral replication at early stages (Lani et al. 2016). Phenolic acids have shown significant antiviral activity against HSV-1 very significantly (Medini et al. 2016). Similarly, stilbenes have shown antiviral properties against HIV and HCV (Gastaminza et al. 2011; Krawczyk 2019). Fan and co-workers reported luteolin, a nontoxic dietary flavonoid with antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Luteolin belongs to the flavone group of flavonoids and is present in chamomile tea, perilla leaf, green pepper, and celery. The virucidal activity of luteolin was observed in A549 cell lines infected with JEV, and reported that luteolin inhibits the viral replication at the post entry of virus. Luteolin did not inhibit the replication at the time of viral entry (Fan et al. 2016). More recently, a group of researchers have identified pinocembrin having anti-Zika activity. They screened a library containing flavonoids against Zika virus. They analyzed cell viability and viral titers and finally identified pinocembrin (present in honey, tea, and red wine) as an anti-Zika compound. It was observed that the pinocembrin strongly inhibited the Zika virus infection in JEG-3-infected cells, and also revealed that it inhibits the viral replication at post entry stages inside the cell (Lee et al. 2019). Likewise, LeCher et al. (2019) have identified the potential phytochemical that is effective against herpes B virus. They have reported genistein, a flavonoid present in Fabaceae family and in soy-based foods. Due to the lack of permanent treatment of herpes B virus, the researchers also checked the synergistic effects of genistein with the already available antivirals (acyclovir and ganciclovir) to develop the effective treatment. They have reported the antiviral activity of genistein against herpes B virus, and also revealed that it targets the virus after the viral replication stage. Moreover, its combination with the acyclovir and ganciclovir proved to be effective with the reduction of effective dose (LeCher et al. 2019). Similarly, genistein has been reported to possess antiviral activity against HSV-1, cytomegalovirus, and bovine herpesvirus-1, SV40, human papilloma virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, African swine fever virus, and HIV (LeCher et al. 2019). Anti-simian rotavirus SA-11 activity of the ethanolic extracts was reported from the leaves of medicinal plant (Myracrodruon urundeuva), found in Brazil (Cecílio et al. 2016). Further, they have investigated the crude extracts to analyze the activity of pure concentrated bioactive compounds and did the evaluation of the virucidal activity against rotavirus SA-11. They have fractioned five compounds from the leaves using TLC and HPLC and checked their anti-rotavirus activity. They have identified that the flavonoid-enriched fraction showed the strongest anti-rotavirus activity (Cecílio et al. 2016). More recently, Iloghalu et al. (2019) researched on the plant extracts to identify the effective antiviral against noroviruses, which has yet no treatment and control. They worked on the phytochemicals extracted from seeds and calyces of Zanthoxylum armatum and Hibiscus sabdariffa to identify the antiviral activity. Also, they selected myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin phenolic compounds and observed viral reduction activity by using norovirus-infected RAW 264.7 cell lines. According to them, quercetin was able to considerably reduce the viral titer, and hence suggested that it can be used in controlling the human norovirus infections (Iloghaluet al. 2019). In a study, 500 compounds in flavonoid library were screened for antiviral activities, and finally selected as the top leading flavonoids (ST077124 and ST024734) and elucidated their antiviral activity against human enterovirus A71 (HEVA71) infection. These leads proved to be effective at the noncytotoxic concentration of 50 μM and significantly diminished the viral titers. The compound ST077124 inhibits the human enteroviruses, but another identified compound ST024734 showed the antiviral activity for the infection caused by human enteroviruses, as well as for dengue virus. Both of the compounds hindered the transcription and translation machinery of the virus, and the researchers suggested that these compounds could be the potential inhibitors of HEVA71 (Min et al. 2018). A group of investigators have demonstrated the antiviral activities of Ficus cunninghamii. This plant has been found to contain several flavonoids, such as quercetin-3-O-α-d-arabinopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-β-d-galactopyranoside, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-galactopyranoside, and kaempferol-3-O-α-d-arabinopyranoside. They studied the radical scavenging activity and reported the importance of hydroxyl group (–OH) for the activity of flavonoids. The presence of more number of –OH group enhanced the antioxidant activity of flavonoids. They identified and reported that the flavonoid from F. cunninghamii has mild inhibitory effect against hepatitis A virus (Orabi and Orabi 2016). A comparative study on the antiviral activity of flavonoids (EGCG, ECG, quercetin, daidzein, fisetin, baicalein, kaempferol, biochanin A, theaflavin, and digallate) against murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) was carried out by Seo et al. (2016). These flavonoids were earlier reported to have an antiviral activity against RNA viruses (Sithisarn et al. 2013; Seo et al. 2016). The results of Seo et al.’s (2016) study concluded that the antiviral activity against MNV and FCV of these flavonoids was found to be in the following order: quercetin < daidzein < fisetin < EGCG and ECG < quercetin < daidzein < kaempferol, respectively. FCV viral titer was significantly reduced by the activity of kaempferol and daidzein at 200 mM concentration level. Moreover, the MNV viral titer was reduced by daidzein and quercetin, when used at the concentration of 50 and 100 mM, respectively (Seo et al. 2016). In another study by Bang et al. (2016), the aerial parts of Salvia plebeia R. Br were analyzed for antiviral activity against influenza A (H1N1) neuraminidase. Two of the flavonoids showed antiviral efficacy against H1N1 virus by inhibiting the replication cycle. These flavonoids were found to be potential inhibitors of H1N1 neuraminidase and thus inhibited the growth of the virus (Bang et al. 2016). More recently, the anti-dengue activity of plants found in Indonesia (Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus, and Acorus calamus) was observed by Rosmalena et al. (2019). They have performed in silico as well as in vitro experiments to elucidate the antiviral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Although the solvent extracts of all the plants showed the inhibitory effect, the highest inhibition was recorded for the methanolic extracts of M. fatua. Hence, they suggested the plant for further exploration to make use of it in the herbal formulations in the treatment of dengue virus (Rosmalena et al. 2019). Moreover, by using in silico studies, Anusuya and co-workers have reported that some of the phytocompounds, such as 5-hydroxy-3,3′,4′,6,7,8-hexamethylflavone, 4′,5,6,7-tetramethylflavone, and 7″-methylamentoflavone, possess the potential of inhibiting dengue virus (Anusuya and Gromiha 2019).\", \"Alkaloids, a type of secondary metabolite of plants consist of the presence of nitrogen atom in its ring structure. Alkaloids are generally present in the higher plants and comprise of various biological activities like anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, and antiasthma (Shi et al. 2014). It has been reported that about 43 alkaloids exhibit activity against the influenza virus (Moradi et al. 2018). The antiviral activity against influenza virus by the alkaloids can be due to induction of interferons of the immune system. Some of the alkaloids enhance the activity of macrophages, hence phagocytose to destroy the virus. Alkaloids inhibit the influenza viral infection at different stages of replication. Some of them either inhibit the synthesis of viral proteins or hinder at the other stages of replication (Moradi et al. 2018). In a study by Zhang et al. (2013), it is reported that homonojirimycin (HNJ), an alkaloid extracted from Commelina communis, exhibits a strong inhibitory activity against influenza viral infection. They also carried out in vivo studies, in which the mice infected with the H1N1 showed a good survival rate, when administered with HNJ by developing good immune response against influenza (Zhang et al. 2013). Dendrobine, an alkaloid present in the plant root of Dendrobium nobile, has been analyzed by Li et al. (2017) for its antiviral activity. They reported the antiviral property of dendrobine against influenza A viruses. Their studies revealed that dendrobium failed to inhibit the virus during the viral entry, but reduced the viral titer during viral replication. Dendrobine has the ability to bind the nucleoprotein of virus, restraining the viral replication, and hence restricts its export. Moreover, the synergistic effects of dendrobine and zanamivir (a medication used to treat and prevent influenza) were shown to significantly inhibit the influenza A virus replication (Li et al. 2017). More recently, several synthetic compounds were synthesized, including alkaloid analogues, and investigated for their influenza virus inhibition activity (Chernyshov et al. 2019). According to their study results, these compounds successfully inhibited the viral infection and exhibited the antiviral activity against various influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N2). Wu et al. (2012) extracted alkaloids from the marine-derived fungus Dichotomomyces cejpii F31-1, and elucidated the antiviral activity for the inhibition of dengue virus (Wu et al. 2012). Moreover, Kaushik et al. (2018) reported alkaloids from the plants like Castanospermum australe, Houttuynia cordata, Myrtopsis corymbosa, and Uncaria tomentosa to possess antiviral activity against dengue virus (Kaushik et al. 2018). The preliminary screening of phytochemicals in Phaleria macrocarpa plant showed the presence of alkaloids along with several other phytocompounds. These plant extracts were shown to exhibit nontoxicity to Vero cells, but showed strong antiviral properties against HSV (Ismaeel et al. 2018a, b). Likewise, the methanol extract of Ziziphus jujube plant was shown to have eight cyclopeptide alkaloids. Out of which, three alkaloids showed inhibitory effects against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) using the cytotoxicity assay and cytopathic effect inhibition assay (Kang et al. 2015). Enantia chlorantha (Oliver), a traditional medicinal plant, has been in use in Nigeria for curing malaria fever, caused by Plasmodium spp. This plant has been found to have antiviral activity against hepatitis A, B, C, and D. The alkaloids, such as berberine present in the stem bark of this plant have been assessed by Ohemu et al. (2018) against Newcastle disease virus, and the results showed that alkaloids exhibited toxic effects to the viruses.\", \"Terpenes consist of five carbon isoprene units with simple hydrocarbons, and belong to the biggest category of secondary metabolites. On the other hand, terpenoids are just the modified forms of terpenes with various functional groups at different positions. Terpenoids, also called as isoprenoids are natural compounds present in plants and have a significant role in pharmaceuticals, therapeutics, and herbal treatments. Terpenoids like diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and triterpenoids have wide variety of application in the area of medicine (Jaeger and Cuny 2016; Perveen and Al-Taweel 2018).\", \"Kazakova et al. (2018) studied the antiviral activity of betulin and dihydroquinopimaric acid derivatives against influenza A virus (H7N1), HSV type 1, non-enveloped RNA virus (ECHO 6), and HIV type 1. The modification at C3 and C28 of betulic acid showed the antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HIV-1. Moreover, the modifications at the C4 position of dihydroquinopimaric acid enhanced the anti-H7N1 activity. Due to the lack of cost-effective treatment and the nonavailability of vaccines for HCV, researchers have moved towards the prospective phytochemical-based therapy, which could be more economical and effective. It has been reported that saikoponins, such as SSa, SSb2, SSc, and SSd isolated from the Bupleurum kaoi root, inhibited the infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Lin et al. 2015). It was reported that saikoponins targeted the viral cycle at their very early steps like viral entry/fusion and not the later phase like transcription and translation of viral cycle. SSb2 was the most effective alkaloid, which significantly inhibited the HCV infection (Lin et al. 2015). The activity of Phyllanthus urinaria plant extract against the HCV early entry was observed by Chung et al. (2016). According to their study, the presence of loliolide, a monoterpene hampered the viral attachment to the host membrane, and thus inhibited its entry. Corlay et al. (2014) analyzed the ethanolic extract from the leaves of Croton mauritianus plant and identified the presence of diterpenes, such as 12-O-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 12-O-decanoyl-7-hydroperoxy-phorbol-5-ene-13-acetate along with loliolide, vomifoliol, dehydrovomifoliol, annuionone D, and bluemol C. Among these phytoconstituents, 12-O-decanoylphorbol 13-acetate and 12-O-decanoyl-7-hydroperoxy-phorbol-5-ene-13-acetate showed significant anti-chikungunya activity (Corlay et al. 2014). In a study to evaluate the potential antiviral activity of Aglaia sp. (family, Meliaceae) (Esimone et al. 2010), the presence of terpenes was identified, which could inhibit HIV-1 by creating a cytotoxic environment and resisting the proliferation of the virus. The terpenes also showed the inhibition of several other viruses, such as retroviruses, including simian immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemic virus. The 3, 4-secodammarane triterpenoid was observed to inhibit cell cycle between S and G2/M phase, and thus inhibiting the viral replication and dissemination. Terpenes present in the methanolic extract of Marrubium vulgare were studied for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 through plaque reduction assay (Fayyad et al. 2014). They reported that terpenes could disrupt the attachment of HSV to the cell membrane and interfere in the replication of HSV-1 virus. Likewise, terpenes (oleanolic terpenoids) extracted from the Camellia japonica flowers were analyzed by Yang et al. (2015) for their antiviral activity against PEDV. These compounds suppressed the viral replication by restraining the proper structural formation and inhibited genes coding for GP2 spike, GP5membrane protein, and GP6 nucleocapsid (Yang et al. 2015).\", \"Lignans are the phenolic secondary metabolites of plants. Lignans are observed to be antihepatotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant. Furthermore, many lignans have been found to be antiviral against HIV and influenza (Hazra and Chattopadhyay 2016; Salehi et al. 2018). A lignin bisphenol, namely honokiol, was identified from Magnolia tree by Fang et al. (2015), and the tree parts are routinely used in the Chinese medicine. The treatment of honokiol to dengue virus strains revealed that it could inhibit the synthesis of dsRNA, and interfere in the replication process. The nonstructural proteins, particularly ns1 and ns3, and the intermediate proteins formed during replication were observed to be suppressed by honokiol. The phytochemical studies also revealed that it may affect the endocytic entry of dengue virus, and hence reduce the number of viral particles in the cytoplasm (Fang et al. 2015). A lignan, 3-hydroxy caruilignan C (3-HCL-C), was extracted from the stems of Swietenia macrophylla, and it was found to be effective against chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Wu et al. 2012). Moreover, the antiviral activity of 3-HCL-C in combination with interferon-α (IFN-α), an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor (2’-C-methylcytidine; NM-107), or telaprevir (an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor) reduced the viral infection significantly. This lignin inhibited the virus at both translation and transcriptional phases. Several other studies have demonstrated the similar activity of 3-HCL-C against HIV-1, hepatitis B, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Wu et al. 2012). A prominent presence of bombasinol, a lignan, is observed in many plants belonging the Bombacaceae family. Upon researching, it was found that this compound had the inhibitory activity against hepatitis B virus (Wang et al. 2013). Furthermore, Pilkington et al. (2018) isolated phytochemicals from the seeds of Silybum marianum and elucidated their antiviral activities against HCV. More recently, Rhinacanthus nasutus plant was evaluated for its use to cure fungal and herpes virus infections. Lignans, isolated from the roots of this plant, demonstrated antiviral activities. The compounds were studied and reported to have antiviral activity against PR8 influenza virus strain, Coxsackie virus, and human rhinovirus 1B virus (Ngoc et al. 2019). A Chinese herb, Radix isatidis has been used for treating several viral diseases, such as influenza virus, HSV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mumps virus, coxsackie virus, and hepatitis B virus. Hui et al. (2019) reported the significant antiviral activity of lignans isolated from this plant. The mechanism hypothesized was that the lignans present in the plant can target adsorption and replication of RSV (Hui et al. 2019). Similarly, lignan glycosides isolated from the fruit of Forsythia suspense were established to possess anti-influenza A (H5N1) activity as revealed by in vitro studies (Li et al. 2019).\", \"Coumarins belong to the benzopyrones family of phytochemicals and were initially found in the plant Dipteryx odorata. These phytochemicals are in medicinal uses, since a long time in many forms of the traditional medicines across the globe (Matos et al. 2015; Bahadori et al. 2016). As reported by Bahadori and co-workers, Simaroubaceae family members have been observed to contain coumarin as a significant phytochemical, and this phytochemical is demonstrated to be biologically active in inhibiting HIV (Bahadori et al. 2016). In another experiment, Mammea americana and Tabernaemontana cymosa were evaluated for their phytochemicals and antiviral activities. M. americana was reported with two types of coumarin compounds (i.e., 34SK001 and 34SK002) obtained after column chromatography and has antiviral property. The experiments done by the group of scientist included various strategies, including inhibition assays for dengue as well as chikungunya virus. According to them, almost 100% inhibition was obtained in vitro by these two coumarins for dengue and chikungunya virus (Gomez-Calderón et al. 2017). Moreover, the medicinal plants aiding the protection against or treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus were tested for the presence of coumarins by Rohini and Padmini (2016). According to them, hexane extract of Andrographis paniculata contained coumarins. Additionally, ethyl acetate extract of Santalum album was shown to have small quantities of coumarins, whereas ethanolic extract showed a slight presence of coumarin in plants A. paniculata, Trichosanthes dioica, Chrysopogon zizanioides, and S. album. As these medicinal plants and their preparations are effective in inhibiting the viral growth, especially due to the occurrence of coumarins, they are commonly used in the treatment of dengue and chikungunya viruses (Rohini and Padmini 2016). An experiment was performed to understand the phytochemical analysis of medicinal plant, Morinda citrifolia, which has been known to exhibit antiviral properties. The bark extracts of the plant were researched for phytochemicals, and the extracted compounds were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify the presence of coumarins (Wang et al. 2016). They also predicted that a very significant amount of coumarins in the extract could be involved in the inhibition of H1N1 virus (Wang et al. 2013).\", \"Recently, Hu et al. (2019) designed 24 coumarin derivatives and observed for their activity against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Among all of them, only one coumarin (C4) significantly suppressed IHNV infection by inhibiting apoptosis and causing cellular damages. Hence, it could be the potential lead for the development of anti-IHNV vaccine/drug (Hu et al. 2019).\", \"The World Intellectual Property Organization Patent Application (WIPO), with a patent application number of WO2017069661A1 assigned to a limited liability company, claims the antiviral activity of pyrimidyl-di(diazaspiro-alkanes) against herpes virus, HIV, papillomavirus, and hepatitis virus. The US patents US9491193B2 and US 9481630 assigned to Korea Research Institute of Bioscience claim the phorbol-type diterpene compound and ingenane-type diterpene compound, respectively, to show antiviral activity by inhibiting viral replication. Likewise, WO20091589A1, another patent assigned to Instytut Medycyny Doswiadczalnej I Klinicznej PAN, claims the preparations of Viburnum opulus fruit in the prevention and therapy of HSV infections. This preparation claims the use of active ingredients in ointments or creams for external use as well as an active ingredient of pills for oral administration. Another patent, US20170333390A1, assigned to Commission on Higher Education, Chiang Mai University, claims xanthones in combination with sesamin possess anti-inflammatory, anti-cytokine storm, and antiviral activity (against anti-influenza). The patented phytochemicals are listed in Table 2.\", \"Traditional plants have been continuously used in the field of medicine for the treatment of various infections. Therapies based on natural products (phytochemicals) for human health are associated with less toxicity and minimal side effects. Thus, the researchers are focusing to elucidate the new plant-based compounds for the treatment of many diseases. Different plant secondary metabolites have been studied and used for various human-based treatments because of antioxidant, anticancerous, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Several in silico and in vitro studies have revealed the promising use of photochemicals for the treatment of viral infections. Among all the phytochemicals, flavonoids have been widely exploited and studied for the treatment of several viral diseases. Furthermore, some of the flavonoids exhibited good antiviral activity against influenza, dengue, chikungunya, and many more viruses and can be a potential candidate which can be processed further to the development of antivirals. Other phytochemicals like terpenoids and alkaloids also showed effective activity against viral diseases. Moreover, the combination of phytochemicals with the different compounds either with any synthetic compound or any drug can be also a new, potential approach to find the good antiviral therapies. Along with this, the dose of phytochemicals and the mechanism behind it to inhibit viral infections needs to be further determined which is very essential for the development of effective and potential antiviral drug.\", \"Antiviral therapies for the life-threatening viral diseases are generally expensive and have adverse side effects. Even some of the viral diseases do not have any antiviral treatments like chikungunya virus and HIV. In the realm of the therapeutics, there is an urgent need of effective, safe, and inexpensive antiviral therapies/drugs/inhibitors with minimal side effects to the mankind. Therefore, the approach using the phytochemical could be the better option in the development of antivirals. Synergistic studies employing phytochemicals in combination with either already FDA-approved drugs or inhibitors could be explored in the future for better and long-term efficacy of antiviral. Moreover, repurposing of already reported phytochemical as an inhibitor for viral diseases could be done in search of potential antivirals. Phytochemicals having antiviral activity can be nanoencapsulated for better delivery, prolonged action, and enhanced bioavailability. Moreover, excessive research on different biodiversity-rich regions could be explored to get more potent phytochemicals and metabolites as antiviral agents.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {\n

Anti-HSV antibody (500 neutralizing units) was obtained from a New Zealand White rabbit after multiple intravenous inoculations of lo8 PFU of HSV. Immunocytochemical controls for HSV antigen detection included trigeminal ganglion sections from uninfected mice incubated with the anti-HSV serum and also sections from infected mice incubated with nonimmune rabbit serum.

In the ganglion, the HSV-stained neurons and satelhe cells rapidly increased in number on day 4 PI and decreased on day 6 PI, and stained cells were no longer detected on day 8 PI, as already reported [12] . In the trigeminal root, HSV immunoreactivity was observed in some glial cells in the CNS part of the TREZ on day 4 PI (Fig 2) . Most of the HSV-stained glial cells were morphologically normal. There was no inflammatory cell infiltration around these HSV-stained glial cells. Immunostaining of GFAP, MBP, and Po was generally normal. O n day 6 PI, the HSV-stained glial cells increased in number. The distribution of infected cells was restricted to the medial aspect of the CNS part of the root extending from the PNS-CNS transitional zone to the junction of the pons (Fig 3) . In the lesions, many HSV-stained glial cells were destroyed to small fragments or debris. With double immunostaining, most HSV-stained cells or their fragments were also stained with anti-GFAP serum (Fig 4) . Most of the astrocytes, doubly stained with GFAP and HSV antiserum, were degenerating within such a restricted area. Therefore, the lesion was observed as an area lacking in GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig 5) . In contrast to the remarkable changes in the astrocytes, the CNS and PNS myelinated fibers were immunocytochemically or morphologically normal, except for a few CNS fibers with an altered immunoreactivity near the infiltrating mononuclear cells (see Fig 5) . O n day 8 PI, CNS myelinated fibers began to change, both immunocytochemically and morphologically in the area where GFAP staining was completely lacking. Here, the HSV-stained glial cells were no longer observed in the lesion. O n day 10 PI, an active destruction of CNS myelin was apparent and an area lacking in MBP immunostaining was evident. Interestingly, the extent of the demyelinated lesions was similar to the area where the GFAP immunostaining was lacking and the demyelination never extended beyond the area lacking GFAP \",\r\n        \"In demyelinating lesions of EAE (10 and 14 days PI), PML, and acute MS, actively demyelinating changes were observed, as described elsewhere {9-11) (Fig 8) . Alteration or loss of MBP immunoreactivity was observed in the degenerating myelin sheaths. MBPstained myelin debris or macrophages containing MBP-stained materials were numerous, yet astrocytes were intact immunocytochemically and morphologically, even near infiltrating mononuclear cells or macrophages. O n the contrary, the GFAP-stained astrocytes were increased in number and immunoreactivity in the surrounding lesions compared with findings in the control rat CNS or nonneurological control brains. In these lesions, there were hypertrophic astrocytes heavily stained with GFAP antiserum. [ 13) and coronavirus infection in mice ation in T-cell-deficient (nude) mice and cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice inoculated with HSV by the corneal route. Even in immunocompetent mice, only rare macrophages were noted stripping myelin lamellae, and it was supposed that bystander rather than immune-specific demyelination was the main mechanism, with demyelination produced by proteases released from activated macrophages 120). Obtaining the opposite result of more widespread and severe de- 4 ) indicates that at the early stage, the HSV-1 infection is overwhelmingly in astrocytes. There is rapid lysis of astrocytes as shown by focal areas in which GFAP immunostaining is completely lost by 6 days after HSV inoculation. Loss of MBP immunostaining indicating demyelination begins just after this extensive lysis of astrocytes, and the area of demyelination as defined by loss of MBP immunostaining is strictly confined to the area of astrocyte destruction as shown by loss of GFAP immunostaining. In contrast, we have found in lesions of acute MS and in early lesions of PML and EAE that there are no degenerative changes in astrocytes, morphologically or immunocytochemically; but we did observe reactive astrocytes or astrocytosis in these lesions. Therefore, it is likely that the early loss of astrocytes is characteristic of HSV-induced demyelination and not other demyelinating lesions.\",\r\n        \"Astrocytes have long been thought to play a skeletal role in the CNS, separating various synapses and serving as a means of nutrient transport from blood to neurons; and astrocyte proliferation is a well-known response to nonspecific CNS damage. The astrocyte also plays an immunological role for presenting antigen to T lymphocytes {29]. They express major histocompatibility complex class 1 antigen on their surface and would be targets for class I-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes [30}. In addition, recent experimental studies have suggested the requirement of astrocytes for regeneration of CNS myelin {31-337.\",\r\n        \"On the basis of the studies reported here, it is tempting to speculate that the rapid astrocyte destruction itself contributes to HSV-induced demyelination. Neither the temporal sequence of astrocyte loss preceding demyelination nor the correspondence in areas of astrocyte destruction and demyelination, however, prove a cause and effect relation. It has been shown that HSV infection in oligodendroglia follows a longer time course and there is relative preservation of oligo-dendroglia at the time of extensive astrocyte loss and onset of destruction of myelin lamellae [1, 251, but we cannot exclude oligodendroglia damage as a cause of the demyelination. More detailed study of HSV-1 infection in oligodendroglia is needed to help determine the significance of the early astrocyte loss in this model.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2:

ventricles, with normal or near-normal systolic function and wall thickness (Richardson et al., 1996). A variety of specific pathological processes can cause RCM, including endomyocardial scarring, myocardial fibrosis or infiltrative disorders (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). These conditions are divided into two distinct groups in man: those with predominant endocardial involvement (endomyocardial form) and others with predominant myocardial involvement (myocardial form) (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). This classification of RCM also appears to be applicable to cats (Ferasin et al., 2003, Fox, 2004) and the endomyocardial type, also known as endomyocardial fibrosis, is the most prevalent form of feline RCM (Bond and Fox, 1984, Kimura et al., 2016).\",\r\n        \"A prominent pathological feature of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM is severe and extensive fibrous thickening of the endocardium and chamber deformity (Fox, 2004). This process primarily affects the left ventricle (LV) or, rarely, both ventricles. There are two basic morphological patterns of endocardial fibrosis, although a degree of overlap in features may occur (Fox, 2004). In the first pattern, the LV shows diffuse, marked fibrosis, which appears as an opaque, white–grey, firm covering involving substantial portions of the left ventricular cavity. In the second pattern, large trabecular or irregular broad bands are observed bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum (VS) and often causing fixed stenosis or a fibrotic tube in the mid to apical left ventricular chamber. This is the most common form reported in cats with endomyocardial RCM (Fox, 2004).\",\r\n        \"The aetiology of endomyocardial RCM in cats is unknown, but is thought to be multifactorial, as there is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and pathological phenotypes (Fox, 2004). Possible hypotheses include viral or immune-mediated endomyocarditis followed by reparative fibrosis, or a consequence of the end stage of myocardial failure and infarction from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Fox, 1999, Fox, 2004).\",\r\n        \"The present report provides a fuller description of the range of pathological features in the endomyocardial form of RCM and presents a hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of this disease in the cat.\",\r\n        \"As described in our previous report (Kimura et al., 2016), the materials for the present study were obtained from consecutive feline necropsy examinations conducted at the Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Oncology, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan, during the period 2005–2014. A total of 327 necropsy examinations were performed on cats with heart disease, and 41 cats were diagnosed as having the endomyocardial form of RCM. In these cases, the diagnosis was based on characteristic gross features of marked fibrosis focally or diffusely involving the endocardium of the LV. The hallmark gross findings included an enlarged heart with marked left atrial and often right atrial dilation and hypertrophy; severe and extensive endocardial fibrosis, frequently bridging the left ventricular free wall and VS; left ventricular hypertrophy commonly associated with wall and chamber deformity; and mural thrombi in the left atrium (LA) or LV (Fox, 1999, Fox, 2004).\",\r\n        \"A complete necropsy examination was performed on all 41 cats within 12 h of death. The hearts were examined and weighed, and the heart weight to body weight (HW/BW) was calculated (i.e. HW in g/BW in kg). The hearts were then placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 5 days. After fixation, the ventricles were sliced transversely into serial sections approximately 5 mm thick, from the mitral valve to the cardiac apex. Each transverse ventricular slice was embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Selected sections were also stained with Masson's trichrome for collagen fibres, elastic van Gieson for elastic fibres and alcian blue (pH 2.5) and toluidine blue for acidic glycosaminoglycans. The microscopical examination focused on any morphological changes in the endocardium of the LV.\",\r\n        \"Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for identification of the endothelial marker CD34 (mouse monoclonal anti-human CD34 class II, Clone QBEnd-10; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), vimentin (mouse monoclonal antibody against vimentin, clone Vim 3B4; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; mouse monoclonal antibody against human smooth muscle actin, clone 1A4; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), caldesmon (mouse monoclonal antibody against human caldesmon, clone h-CD; 1 in 100 dilution; Dako), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; rabbit polyclonal antibody against PDGF BB; 1 in 50 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β; rabbit polyclonal antibody against TGF-β; 1 in 100 dilution; Abcam) in the endocardium of the LV. The avidin–biotin–peroxidase method (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) was employed in order to identify the reaction product, with haematoxylin as a counterstain.\",\r\n        \"Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine whether viral nucleic acids were detectable in cardiac tissues including the endocardium, myocardium and epicardium. DNA and RNA samples were extracted from wax-embedded tissue blocks of 14 cat hearts with endomyocardial RCM collected between 2012 and 2014 using the RecoverAll™ Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). Screening for a total of six viruses, including feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), was carried out according to their prevalence, and the feline β-actin gene (ACTB) was selected as a positive control. Primer pairs and TaqMan probes labelled with the reporter dye FAM at the 5′ end and fluorescent dye TAMRA at the 3′ end for FHV, FPLV, FIV and FeLV were designed on the basis of the published sequences (Dieter et al., 1999, Vögtlin et al., 2002, Ravi et al., 2005, André et al., 2013). New primer–probe sets for FCV, FCoV and ACTB were designed to amplify the conserved region of each genome using PrimeQuest™ software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa, USA). All primer sequences, target gene names and Genbank accession numbers are listed in Table 1\\n. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using a LightCycler® Nano (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and a one-step PrimeScript™ RT-PCR kit (TAKARA Biotech, Shiga, Japan). Nuclease-free water was used for negative controls in each run. The thermal cycling conditions were the same as those described previously (Tsuchiaka et al., 2016).\",\r\n        \"Macroscopically, although some overlap was evident between them, two types of fibrotic lesion were observed in the endocardium of the LV. Most commonly, patchy endocardial lesions occurred as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen from the free wall to the septum (‘patchy’ pattern; n = 34) (Fig. 1\\nA). The fibrous bands were usually located between the anterior and/or posterior papillary muscles (PMs) and the VS, frequently causing intraventricular partial obstruction and/or chamber deformity at different levels. Less commonly, the left ventricular endocardium showed diffuse and marked fibrosis, which appeared as a white–grey, smooth, firm and uniform covering over the inflow and outflow tracts, PMs, mitral valve apparatus and, occasionally, the aortic valves and trunk (‘diffuse’ pattern; n = 7) (Fig. 1B). In this type, extensive fibrosis caused a moderate to marked reduction of left ventricular chamber size. The mitral valve apparatus and PMs were distorted and fused to surrounding structures.\",\r\n        \"Heart weights in the cats with endomyocardial RCM (HW/BW 6.0 ± 1.1 g/kg [mean ± SD]) were greater than those in cats with normal hearts (4.0 ± 0.3 g/kg; Liu and Tilley, 1980). The LA and its auricular appendage were markedly enlarged, often with apparent wall thickening. Mural thrombi occurred in the LA, left auricle or LV and were found in 29.3% of the affected cats. In addition, distal aortic thromboembolism was observed in 43.9% of cases.\",\r\n        \"Histologically, the endocardium of the LV was thickened by proliferation of hyaline and/or fibrous tissue in all 41 cases, regardless of the macroscopic pattern of endocardial thickening. The endocardial lesions were divided into three main histological types, although some cases with intermediate features were observed.\",\r\n        \"In three of the 41 cases, the thickened endocardium was covered by intact endothelial cells and contained a large number of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by various amounts of alcian blue-positive ground substance with delicate collagen fibrils (type 1) (Fig. 2\\nA). These mesenchymal cells had large oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli, faintly eosinophilic cytoplasm and poorly defined cell margins, and were randomly arranged.\",\r\n        \"In the second type (type 2), which accounted for 19 of the 41 cases, the endocardial thickening revealed a two-layer structure (i.e. superficial and deep layers; Fig. 2B). These two layers were sometimes ill-defined, and there was some variation, even within the same chamber. The superficial layer consisted of polymorphic mesenchymal cells and a large amount of alcian blue-positive ground substance intermixed with delicate collagen fibrils. Some cells in this area were round to polygonal, had a metachromatic capsule when stained with toluidine blue, and sometimes were located within lacunae, showing chondrogenic differentiation. The deep layer was composed of densely arranged collagen fibres with frequently elongated mesenchymal cells. These cells had fusiform nuclei arranged in a uniform wavy pattern.\",\r\n        \"The third type (type 3) accounted for the other 19 cases. This type of lesion consisted of thick collagen fibres with sparse elastic fibres, occasionally containing foci of chondroid metaplasia (Fig. 2C). The mesenchymal cells interspersed among bundles of mature collagen fibres were oriented predominantly with their long axis parallel to the endocardial surface. These cells were similar in appearance to those seen in the deep layer of type 2 lesions, but were slightly less numerous.\",\r\n        \"Cats with type 1 lesions were young, with a mean age at death of 1.8 years (range = 0.3–3.0 years; SD = 1.4), while cats with type 2 and 3 lesions were usually older, with mean ages at death of 5.5 years (range = 2–11 years; SD = 2.6) and 10.2 years (range = 3–19 years; SD = 5.2), respectively. There were significant differences in the age at death among the three types (one-way analysis of variance; P <0.001).\",\r\n        \"In the endocardial lesions showing a diffuse pattern, the line between the thickened endocardium and the underlying myocardium was usually well defined. There were no inflammatory cells in the endocardium or the myocardium, and there was no evidence of myocardial degeneration, necrosis or fibrosis (Fig. 2). In some cases, however, fibrous tissue of the endocardium extended for various distances into the myocardium, accompanying mild to moderate atrophy of myocardial fibres.\",\r\n        \"In the endocardial lesions showing a patchy pattern, trabecular or broad bands of fibrous tissue always included multiple left ventricular false tendons (LVFTs), which were composed of central Purkinje fibres and surrounding collagen fibres. In lesions showing this pattern, mesenchymal cells derived from pre-existing LVFTs had proliferated vigorously, showing a characteristic concentric circular pattern centering on the LVFTs. These cells produced a large amount of alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils (type 1), resulting in fusion of the markedly thickened LVFTs (Fig. 3\\nA). The cellular fibrous tissue then matured into densely arranged collagenous connective tissue (type 2) (Fig. 3B), and eventually comprised a large mass of fibrous scar tissue (type 3) (Fig. 3C). Also in this lesion pattern, no distinct inflammatory changes were evident.\",\r\n        \"In all 41 cases, positive labelling for CD34 was limited to the surface cells of the thickened endocardium and the capillary-like channel-lining cells. The stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells embedded within the fibrous connective tissue were diffusely positive for vimentin, as well as α-smooth muscle actin and caldesmon, although a small proportion of the cells were not labelled for either of the latter markers (Fig. 4\\nA, B). PDGF and TGF-β were present frequently on the cell surface and in the surrounding fibrous connective tissue, especially in type 1 and 2 lesions (Figs. 4C, D).\",\r\n        \"None of the viral genomes tested were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality, while the ACTB genome was detected in all samples.\",\r\n        \"The endomyocardial form of RCM in cats was first described in 1970 by Liu, who reported a retrospective series of 68 cases of focal endocardial and myocardial fibrosis in the LV as ‘acquired cardiac lesions leading to congestive heart failure’. Thereafter, the clinical and morphological features of the abnormality were assessed systematically and reported as a distinct disease entity in 1980 by Liu and Tilley. In 2004, Fox reported the first comprehensive description of the disease. Since then, no additional pathological studies of the aetiology of feline endomyocardial RCM have been reported.\",\r\n        \"In the present study, the endocardial lesions were classified into three types according to their histological composition and structure. Type 1 lesions were found only in young cats aged between 4 months and 3 years, while type 2 and 3 lesions were observed predominantly in middle-aged and older cats, respectively. In addition, the number of cat hearts with type 1 lesions was much lower than the number with type 2 and 3 lesions. Considering the degree of fibrous tissue maturation in each lesion type, it is very likely that the type 1 lesion is an early form of this abnormality, which usually progresses to the more mature type 2 and 3 forms with age. The gradations of the endocardial lesions, the presence of intermediate cases, and the age relationship appear to indicate that the endomyocardial form of feline RCM develops after birth and progresses gradually with age. The fact that no reports appear to have documented the disease in newborn kittens lends further support to this idea.\",\r\n        \"In the immunohistochemical study, the mesenchymal cells embedded within fibrous connective tissue showed a positive reaction with antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin and caldesmon, indicating a tendency for smooth muscle differentiation; however, undifferentiated cells best classified as primitive mesenchymal cells were also present. In this connection, it is of interest that the subendocardial layer originally contains smooth muscle cells and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, especially in the left ventricular septal region and the LA (John et al., 2001). Furthermore, the presence of PDGF and TGF-β was confirmed immunohistochemically. It is well known that these growth factors regulate the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and their synthesis of extracellular matrix, leading to the development of arteriosclerotic intimal lesions (Gotlieb and Silver, 2001). Therefore, it is considered that the proliferation of pre-existing mesenchymal cells, which are capable of undergoing smooth muscle differentiation, cause or contribute to the formation of endocardial lesions in the endomyocardial form of feline RCM.\",\r\n        \"Macroscopically, patchy endocardial thickening was the most common pattern of endomyocardial RCM in cats, as reported previously (Fox, 2004). The patchy lesions appeared as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen, usually from the anterior and/or posterior PMs to the VS. Histologically, the fibrous bands invariably included multiple LVFTs around which mesenchymal cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils. These observations suggest that LVFTs provide a framework for the formation of fibrous bands, and it is noteworthy that a pathological condition associated with abnormal diffuse networks of LVFTs (referred to as ‘excessive moderator bands’) has been reported in 21 cats with heart failure (Liu et al., 1982). The increased numbers of LVFTs most commonly connected the posterior PM or the anterior PM to the VS, showing arrangement patterns similar to those of the trabecular or broad bands observed in the present study. Considering that multiple LVFTs were embedded within the fibrous bands, it is possible that excessive LVFTs are closely related to the occurrence of this type of RCM. Ferasin (2009) believes that ‘excessive moderator bands’ or ‘moderator band cardiomyopathy’ are simply lesions associated with endomyocardial RCM.\",\r\n        \"The aetiology of the endomyocardial form of feline RCM remains unresolved; however, it has been suggested that endomyocardial damage followed by reparative fibrosis might be associated with viral or immune-mediated endomyocarditis (Fox, 2004). Endomyocarditis of undetermined origin has been described as an important disease of cats since the early 1970s (Liu, 1970, Stalis et al., 1995). In addition, parvoviral genomic material has been isolated from a small number of feline hearts with cardiomyopathy (including RCM) and myocarditis, although cause and effect has not been established (Meurs et al., 2000). In the present study, histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases. Furthermore, our molecular biological observations using real-time PCR detected no viral genomes in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality. These findings suggest that any relationship between a virus-induced inflammatory response and the occurrence of feline RCM is unlikely, but do not necessarily rule out this possibility because the present molecular biological study was limited by its small sample size, the localization of viral genomes within the heart and technical factors associated with real-time PCR. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether an immune-mediated pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of endocardial or endomyocardial inflammation, and further studies will be required in order to address this issue.\",\r\n        \"The present observations confirm and extend the findings of previous studies and lead to the following conclusions. Firstly, patchy and diffuse patterns of endocardial thickening are evident macroscopically in the LV, the former being much more common. Secondly, from a histological viewpoint, stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells proliferate vigorously in the endocardium, producing alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; these cells are thought to contribute to endocardial lesion formation. Thirdly, from an immunohistochemical viewpoint, the mesenchymal cells embedded within fibrous connective tissue show a tendency for smooth muscle differentiation. Fourthly, in lesions with a patchy pattern, multiple LVFTs are invariably included within large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue, providing a framework for the formation of the fibrous bands. Finally, the lack of any histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis and the absence of candidate viral genomes in cardiac tissue suggest that the occurrence of feline RCM is not significantly related to a virus-induced inflammatory response.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,0\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,1\": \"problem\",\r\n

It has led governments to take both public measures for population containment and often a resetting of healthcare organization in order to be able to absorb the peak of patients in particular for critical care. Since the inception of the outbreak, all stakeholders seemed keen to access to reliable and \"living\" information regarding the evolution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths in their countries as well as in others. Crossareas comparisons were made to understand some characteristics of this novel epidemic. [1, 2] Also, being able to predict at least in the short term, the evolution of the main outcome indicators has been a relentless objective of care providers and decision makers. A single tool providing such an aid would be likely to respectively inform people and enlighten relevant stakeholders to anticipate the needed measures, in particular regarding the steering of care and social measures.

A classical SIR model considers 3 types of individuals: susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals (I) and recovered individuals (R). [4] Many extensions to this model have been proposed, in particular by adding a compartment of exposed but noncontagious individuals (E) to the model. [5] Other models distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, between patients admitted to intensive care units and patients admitted to regular hospital. [6] [7] [8] The more complex these models are, the more parameters they depend on. A classical method then consists of fixing the value of some of these parameters to values found in the literature and varying the other parameters in order to obtain simulations with dynamics that are similar to those of the data. The main objective of these approaches is not to adjust data, but rather to develop a model that is supposed to represent the reality as closely as possible. Our approach was different: our main objective was to develop an epidemiological model that fits the observed data as closely as possible, while at the same time being as simple as possible.\",\r\n        \"However, we did not aim to develop an empirical model that looks like the data (e.g. using a polynomial model): the model and its parameters must have a real epidemiological interpretation, in terms of transition from one state to another or length of stay in a state. On the one hand, we made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared to the population size, which is realistic as the latest studies suggest an infection rate of around 5% in several countries.\",\r\n        \"[9] This hypothesis allowed us to ignore the compartments S of the model. On the other hand, we had to take into account the fact that not all patients were cured but that a certain proportion may die.

(Figure 1) A fundamental parameter of the model is the transmission rate, which indicates how quickly people become infected and become contagious themselves. Our model integrates a timedependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by the country in question. One can thus imagine that the transmission rate was stable -and possibly high -before lockdown and then decreased with lockdown in countries that have adopted such a measure. A piecewise linear model was used for the transmission rate to take into account these possible variations.

unprecedented rage in most parts of the globe, overwhelming the healthcare facilities, locking down cities, hitting hard the economy [1, 2] . Within the first four months from the very first report from the city of Wuhan at the end of December 2019 [1, 3] , the epidemic has already reached more than 200 countries, in all the inhabited continents, infecting more nearly 2.5 million people globally [4] . The death toll is already touching the sky at a devastating pace [4] .\",\r\n        \"Such pandemics, however, are not new in recent times: The 1918 Spanish flu resulted in 50-100 million deaths throughout the globe [5, 6] . In recent years, similar coronavirus outbreak happened in 2003 (SERS-Cov) [7] and 2012 (MERS) [8] killing around a thousand people in China and the Middle east. Following that the outbreak of Ebola cost more than ten thousand lives in Africa [9] . After resulting in massacres in Europe, the pandemic has turned its head towards the United States where more than half of a million people have already been infected within a short span [10] . The complexity in understanding and estimating the spatial spread of the pandemic lies in the conflicting numbers of the rates at which the virus is transmitted to the neighbourhood [11] . Specifically, when multiple hotspots coexist together, only a few recursive events of local transmission turn into a catastrophic avalanche with dramatically increasing number of infections in a very short time window [12] . Moreover, the adaptability of the virus in ever-changing environments is also surprising [13] . Thus, identification of the true character and the self-organization of the epidemic has emerged as one of the biggest global challenges in human history. This is pivotal to develop non-pharmaceutical antidotes with sophisticated intervention strategies to control the dispersal of the pandemic until some clinical solutions arrive in support [14] .\",\r\n        \"Indeed, there are many major challenges in predicting the spatial spread in a country having multiple epicentres of human transmission, using phenomenologi-cal models [15] . Since an effective model requires the prior knowledge of transmission and recovery rates, it is almost impossible to estimate them in the midway of an epidemic, for the rates depend on the nature of instantaneous social preparedness that vary locally. For instance, Germany had three major infected regions, Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia which had roughly twenty thousand cases in each of these federal states on average by the first week of April [16] . In contrast, the other neighbouring states, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Hesse had surprisingly smaller numbers [16] . This situation is significantly different from Hubei that alone had more than eighty percent of the total cases in China [17] .\",\r\n        '\"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful\" [18] . Here, we address the dynamics in an epidemic using a model of interacting hotspots. We consider a model state consisting of multiple cities that exchange infected populations pair-wise stochastically where the local dynamics in the individual cities are governed by the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with instantaneously or regularly updated populations. Moreover, the order of the random exchange of the infected populations is controlled by a connectivity parameter. We show that tuning the connectivity parameter, it is possible to control the cooperativity of the infection propagation. However, the heterogeneity in the cooperativity determines controls over the outbreak. We validate the qualitative features of the model with the data of the heterogeneous evolution of COVID-19 in different provinces of Germany. We discuss further possibilities of development.',\r\n        \"We consider model dynamics in a state consisting of different cities that are allowed to exchange populations among themselves. The population exchange is subject to a containment measure modelled via a connectivity parameter which is assumed to be a constant and identical for all cities. M such interacting cities are considered with initial total populations N i being the sum of the Susceptible (S i ), Infected (I i ) and Recovered (R i ) arXiv:2004.12799v1 [physics.soc-ph] 24 Apr 2020 populations in a city i. For simplicity, the exchange process uses the criteria of classic random exchange of econophysics [19] . During an exchange each of two cities retains an identical fraction of population η and redistributes a random fraction of the infected population pair-wise. The interactions between a pair of cities (i and j) with infected population I i and I j are governed by the exchange rules :\",\r\n        \"with\",\r\n        \"The process also ensures the conservation: N i + N j =Ñ i +Ñ j during the exchange processes. However. after t = 0, the model does not use any restrictions to enforce any conservation in the global population. Here, f R is the random fraction (taken as a uniform deviate between 0 and 1) and η is the connectivity parameter. The parameter serves in the same way as the saving propensity does in the context of econophysics models [19] . Now in the city, i, the time dependent population, N i is sum of instantaneous updated susceptible(S i ), infected(Ĩ i ) and recovered (R i ) populations following the SIR equations of motions [15] :\",\r\n        \"We consider M 2 number of stochastic random exchanges using Eq. (3) (4) between the cities before we update populations using Eqs. (5-7) (See numerical scheme in the Supplementary Information(SI), SI Note.1 ) in each time step. The number of exchanges are optimised in order to ensure significant amount of exchange of infected population among the cities that drives the process. In each of the time steps, we now solve 3M number of coupled differential equations alongside M 2 [20] number of random exchanges to extract the dynamics. We use the time step δt = 1 for the integration throughout the calculation.\",\r\n        \"We monitor the dynamics of such a state consisting of M = 64, 1024 and 4096 cities with identical initial population (N i = 1 at t = 0) for different ranges of magnitudes of connectivity parameter, η. Here N i , S i , I i , R i represent the fraction of the total population in the state M . Each city has identical initial infected population as I i (0) = 0.0001 [21] . The initial conditions make sure that every city has identical behaviour for η = 1 when the cities are made isolated by some intervention protocol as, for η = 1, the cities retain all the population and does not actively take part in the exchanges. In contrast, they exchange freely for η = 0.\",\r\n        \"In Fig. 1 , we show the dynamics of the infected (I) and recovered (R) population in the state with M = 64 for η = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.0. For η = 1.0, the cities are isolated completely. Hence, the behavior of the individual cities are identical to the solutions of SIR equations for a case with identical parameters (See SI Note:2 and SI Fig. 1 ). For β = 0.5 and γ = 0.3333, the peak in I appears at t ≈ 50 with a peak height I P = 0.06 while S and R saturates to steady values S S ≈ 0.45 and R S ≈ 0.55 respectively beyond t ≈ 80. This we also see in the upper panels in Fig. 1 for η = 1.0. The peaks in I also appear simultaneously for all the cities t ≈ 50.\",\r\n        \"For η < 1, as the exchanges of the infected fraction between the cities set in, the behavioural differences in the cities become prominent. In the middle panels of Fig. 1 , we show the evolution of Infected and Recovered population for η = 0.5. We see heterogeneity in the infection propagation: Not only the peaks appear in different times in the different cities, but also the height of the peaks in I i become distinct for each city. The dynamic equilibrium is attained when I i → 0 for all i simultaneously at sufficiently long time after the individual peaks in the infected populations in the cities are observed. These effects become more prominent for lower η. For η = 0, the exchange is completely uncontrolled as individual cities do not have any restriction in retaining the fraction of infected population. Hence, the distributions of both I and R become more diffused as shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 1 . Now for all these cases, we look at the time evolution of the probability distribution of the infected populations, P (I; t) with increasing t. In Fig. 2 , we show the evolution of P (I; t) for different cases of η. As there is a tiny population of infected population in the beginning due to the initial condition, the distribution at t = 0, P (I; 0) ≈ δ(I(0)) for all values of η. For η = 1, as individual cities show a peak at t ≈ 50, the delta peak of P (I) also shifts to higher values of I (Fig. 2.(a.2) ). Since all the cities behave identically for η = 1, there is no spread in the distributions for all t. At higher t when the infected population → 0, the distribution again shifts to smaller values of I( Fig.2(a.3) ).\",\r\n        \"The situation changes for any η < 1 as the exchanges bring broadening in P (I; t), specifically at t → 50. For η = 0.5, there is a significant broadening in P (I) for 40 < t < 60 [ Fig.2(b) ]. The nature of the tail in P (I) albeit changes with t. We even observe a shift in the mode of the peak in P i [Figs. 2(b.1) and 2(b.2) ]. The length of the tail decreases [ Fig. 2(b. 3)] and disappears at higher t. For η = 0 [ Fig.2(c) ], the broadening in the distributions is more prominent, even at intermediate t[ Fig.2(c.1) ]. At t ≈ 50, the tail in P (I) exists upto I ≈ 0.375. It affirms that there is finite probability to have cities with extremely large proportion of the infected populations of the order of I ≈ 0.375 which is almost 37.5 percent of the total population [ Fig.2(c.2) ]. With increasing t, the tail decreases in I and the peak reaches ≈ 0 as the epidemic mitigates around t ≈ 75.\",\r\n        \"In order to understand the role of heterogeneity in the infection propagation, we now focus on the behaviour of the moments of P (I) for different values of the connectivity index, η, at different t [ Fig. 3 ]. The mean of P (I), µ = IP (I)dI is shown in Fig. 3(a) . The behaviour of µ doesn't show much heterogeneity, suggesting that the collective peak appears almost at similar times as for individual cities. This doesn't change much as η is varied. However, the height of the collective peak decrease for smaller η around t ≈ 50. The variance of P (I), σ 2 (t) =< I(t) > 2 − < I 2 (t) > show interesting pattern for t ≈ 50 [ Fig. 3(b) ] as η is varied. Quite naturally, σ 2 (t) → 0 for η → 1. As η is decreased, the cooperativity also decreases due to increasingly larger disorder. For small η and η = 0, σ 2 (t) show prominent non-monotonic behaviour with increasing t. However, the non-monotonic dependence vanishes as η → 1.\",\r\n        \"The shift in µ occurs due to the simultaneous increase in the infected populations while the peak in σ 2 is due to distinct behaviours of the cities. We now look at the behaviour of σ/µ that captures the competition between the two factors. In Fig. 4(a) , we show the phase diagram of σ/µ. σ/µ has prominent non-monotonic dependence near t ≈ 50 for smaller values of η. The peak defines the timescale of heterogeneity in the collective infection \",\r\n        \"We now attempt to understand the COVID-19 data of the cases in different provinces of Germany using the insights of the model. The time series data for Germany for all 16 provinces are shown in Supplementary Information (SI Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . We now analyse the behaviour of σ/µ computed from the distribution of the infected populations in provinces of Germany (See SI Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . We see σ/µ has a sharp peak on 23rd March, 2020. In order to verify the heterogeneity, we further look at the dynamic statistical correlation between the daily new cases in the different provinces for the successive days, using the Pearson correlation between the distribution of the infected populations at all the provinces in time t and t + 1, given by ρ(t, t + 1) = cov[P (I; t), P (I; t + 1)] σ(t)σ(t + 1)\",\r\n        \"We show the dynamic statistical correlation, ρ(t, t + 1) between the number of cases on successive days from all the federal states of Germany in Fig. 5 . We avoid the double count in the data. The trend in the statistical correlation behaves non-monotonically in the period, with a dip on 23rd March when the peak in σ µ appeared, reiter- ating the effect of heterogeneity due to lack of dynamical statistical correlation. Surprisingly, the date exactly matches the date of the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. From the first week of April, there is a clear trend of flattening of the curve with significantly smaller number of cases with respect to the maximum numbers recorded on 27th March. Always, there are continuous exchanges of populations between the provinces in a country unless any intervention is imposed. The mobility between the cities without restriction, in principle resembles the η = 0 case of the model while the situation with strict intervention behaves as η = 1 case of the model when the cities are considered isolated. Considering time dependence in η, it is possible to realize a dynamic picture from pre to post lockdown situations. The behaviour of σ/µ qualitatively features the balance between the spread of the infection in the cities and the relative change in the collective spread of the epidemic in the state. The extremum in σ/µ captures the extreme heterogeneity in the infection propagation as it optimize the relative balance between the local spread and drive in the collective transmission. On this note, the model that we use delivers the similar qualitative feature of the data of COVID-19 cases in the states of Germany.\",\r\n        \"Whether the appearance of the peak in heterogeneity is a universal confirmatory signature of containment, can be confirmed only by further studies. There are many possible ways to develop the minimalistic model. It is possible to include time dependence in the parameters. Random deviates of a different kind can also be tested for modelling specific situations. Also, possibilities of further customization needs system specific details and the set of governing equations where specific rules of death, quarantine or hospitalization counts could be considered in addition. Further, it would be challenging to model the transportation of the infected populations using deterministic equations [22] , vis-a-vis the data driven approaches [23, 24] . On this note, we believe, that this study, opens up horizons in exploring the rich dynamics of infection propagation inluding sophisticated intervention among the interacting hotspots.\",\r\n        \"The author is indebted to D.

[\r\n        \"Hendra virus is a zoonosis – which means it can be transmitted across species boundaries from its natural host (flying foxes or fruit bats) to cause infection and disease in domestic animals and people. Emerging bat-borne infections such as Hendra are a pressing global public health concern (Wong, Lau, Woo, & Yuen, 2007). Hendra is highly lethal to humans and endemic in Australian flying fox populations. Like other new and re-emerging infectious diseases, changes in the incidence and cross-species transmissibility of Hendra are likely to hinge on the ecological impacts of natural events and human activities (Jones et al., 2008). Indeed it is clear that Hendra has ‘spilled’ over from flying fox populations into horses, and then people and pet dogs through their increasingly intense interaction in rural and peri-urban areas. Importantly, the impacts of these interactions are bi-directional; anything that induces ‘stress’ in flying foxes is thought to amplify viral shedding into the environment (Parrish et al., 2008). Efforts to disrupt flying-fox encroachment on human settlement, therefore, are likely to increase the risk of human infection. Current hopes of prevention rest on the development of a vaccine for horses, the only confirmed intermediate host for Hendra transmission to humans. In the interim, public health responses to Hendra have focussed on education and behaviour modification amongst high-risk groups such as veterinarians, horse owners and people who work in equine industries, and the institution of disease surveillance and quarantine measures involving both human and animal health sectors (Adamson, Marich, & Roth, 2011).\",\r\n        \"Since Hendra virus first emerged in 1994 there have only been four human deaths and seven human infections. However concerns in Australia about the risks to human health escalated sharply in 2011 when outbreaks in horses occurred over a greater geographic area and at a far higher frequency than past ‘Hendra seasons’ (Field, Crameri, Kung, & Wang, 2012). Concern about the risks posed by the bat-borne virus were further heightened by the subsequent and unexpected discovery of a pet dog with a naturally acquired infection (Tapim & Withey, 2011).\",\r\n        \"Many Australians, particularly those living in regional areas, already consider flying foxes to be a noisy and unhygienic pest. Towns and city suburbs in north-eastern parts of the country can find themselves ‘under siege’ from large groups of roosting ‘fruit bats’ – with these ‘camps’ or colonies sometimes comprised of several thousand individuals. Aside from the impacts of noise and faeces, flying fox colonies can ‘fly in and feed’ on commercial orchards causing significant economic losses for fruit growers. For this reason there has been a longstanding practice of shooting flying foxes and disrupting their colonies with sirens, smoke bombs and helicopters to deter them from congregating in agricultural and residential areas.\",\r\n        \"Whereas in the past diseases of wild animals were thought to pose limited risk to humans, the connection between human activity – particularly changes in land use – and changes in patterns of infectious disease is becoming increasingly clear (Newell et al., 2005). The urbanisation of coastal habitats is thought to have had a number of effects on flying fox populations in eastern Australia – restricting access to their normal foods and forcing them to both turn to, and increasingly rely on, commercial orchards and urban gardens for sustenance (Plowright et al., 2008). And because food is scarce flying foxes are also less inclined to migrate, leading to the formation of permanent camps in agricultural and residential areas. These effects are also exacerbated by natural events that further limit the availability of natural and horticultural food resources, such as cyclones and floods (Plowright et al., 2011). As large groups of flying foxes congregate in and around human settlements this gives the impression that the population is thriving, whereas this is more a result of reduction in their natural habitat, and several species of flying foxes are, in fact, vulnerable to extinction (Welbergen, Klose, Markus, & Eby, 2008).\",\r\n        \"For this reason, since 1986 in NSW and 1994 in Queensland, flying foxes camps have been legally protected from human interference to try and rehabilitate the population. In 2008 the Queensland government took the further step of refusing all applications by farmers for permits to shoot flying foxes to protect their crops, both on ecological grounds and because attempts to break up established camps may be counterproductive. It was argued that any measures that stressed flying foxes would increase the risk of Hendra spilling over into horses; and dispersing specific camps would likely be ineffective as there would be nothing to stop the colony re-establishing itself nearby, and once again in conflict with human settlement. Thus, what was designed to be legislation to protect a vulnerable species of native animal became a policy instrument with which to try and limit zoonotic risk exposure. This transition from conservation-focussed environmental policy to public health policy has been incremental, such that the policy aim was not to solve either problem but manage areas of emerging concern. Yet as people directly affected by flying foxes have struggled to ‘live with’ the growing throngs of unwelcome neighbours, many have come to believe that by protecting flying fox populations and advocating the adoption of low risk behaviours towards them, governments and health authorities have put the health and welfare of another species above that of human populations.\",\r\n        \"Experiences with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) indicate that policy-making for a new zoonotic disease is always difficult and prone to polarising different stakeholders in affected communities (Phillips, Bridgeman, & Ferguson-Smith, 2000; Singer et al., 2003). A key feature in matters surrounding animal disease control is that radically different policy responses – such as wholesale culling or vaccination – can typically be presented as plausible points of intervention. For this reason decisions surrounding what should be done about new or pressing zoonotic risks are often contested, and finding the right balance between over-caution, laissez-faire approaches, and determining the weight given to different socioeconomic factors can be difficult. For example a lack of due diligence can expose the population to the risk of infection for far longer than necessary, as was the case with BSE. Conversely, the overzealous application of the precautionary principle can destroy the livelihood of a population, impact its food supply, limit development, and entrench or exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantage (World Health Organization, 2004). Furthermore, when the zoonotic risk is new, attempts to explain the choice of policy are likely to be further complicated by uncertainty regarding the precise risk of infection, the drivers of disease emergence, and the measures needed to control the risk of infection. Therefore public support for policies that disrupt people's lives and communities or place precautionary limits on the development of natural resources might depend on their understanding of the causes and risks of zoonotic outbreaks, their trust in government agencies, and the likely consequences for them of different public health responses.\",\r\n        \"In this regard news media are an important source of information for the public (Brodie, Hamel, Altman, Blendon, & Benson, 2003), particularly with regard to the complex relationship between the environment and human health and with regards to the risk posed by animals. For not only does the media reflect the issues that concern people, it also impacts upon the issues the public thinks about, and the criteria through which they think about them – influencing people's understanding of what is at stake, of who or what is to blame, of who is at risk, and of what can be done to address the situation (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, 2000). In this regard, while individual journalists my privilege independence, accuracy and balance, media organisations are rarely neutral and can both influence public opinion themselves, or be used by industry, politicians and interests groups to influence public perception of particular issues and/or promote their own ends (Callaghan & Schnell, 2001; Terkildsen, Schnell, & Ling, 1998). Therefore the effects of how the media chooses to raise to public prominence and then ‘frame’ events and opinions surrounding a new health issue such as an emerging zoonosis can be recursive. For example because elected officials, politicians and policy advisors are responsive to public opinion, public perceptions about the causes of a disease threat like Hendra virus might influence the level of public support for specific health policies, and, thereby, ongoing political debate (Gollust, Lantz, & Ubel, 2009; Harrabin, Coote, & Allen, 2003).\",\r\n        \"In this paper we analyse representations in the Australian media of the causes and consequences of the emergence of Hendra as a zoonotic risk, focussing on how the unavoidable uncertainty about its causes and likely consequences shaped perceptions of the health policies put in place in the attempt to mitigate the risk of human infection. In short we seek to examine media representations of an infectious threat within a broader policy context. Because flying foxes are a highly visible, widespread and relatively novel source of infectious risk for humans, the emergence of Hendra virus presents an opportunity to track and compare media representations of disease ‘events’, health policy goals, political discourses and public opinions in ways that are difficult for non-communicable diseases. In this our research is consistent with other reports examining media portrayals of the health risk and scientific and policy uncertainty associated with contested environmental exposures (Mayer, 2012) and Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) (Daku, Gibbs, & Heymann, 2012; Hilton & Hunt, 2011; Washer, 2010).\",\r\n        \"To identify Australian media coverage of issues surrounding the emergence of Hendra virus, the database Factiva was searched using the following terms as textwords: (Hendra virus) or (flying fox*) or (fruit bat*) for the period 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2011. A News Filter limiting content to the region of Australia was then applied identifying more than 10,000 items. Because we were focussing on representations of Hendra and associated public policy, further Subject Filters were applied to restrict the sample to Political and General News, limiting the corpus to just over 6000 articles. Full-text reports from 9 news media sources from areas affected by Hendra virus outbreaks were then downloaded. The sample includes 2 national media organizations [N] as well as articles appearing in the 3 major provincial [P] newspapers and 4 of the 103 local [L] newspapers in Queensland and New South Wales. They are: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Online News Service [N]; The Australian Newspaper [N]; The Courier Mail [P]; The Daily Telegraph [P]; The NewsMail (Bundaberg) [L]; Sunshine Coast Daily [L]; Sydney Morning Herald [P]; Townsville Bulletin [L]; and, The Warwick Daily News [L]. Pretesting confirmed that this search strategy would produce a larger and more heterogeneous sample of news reports, while still including coverage that focussed more narrowly on specific zoonotic events. From the resulting corpus of 1383 articles we discarded 43 duplicates and 356 reports that were not immediately relevant to Hendra virus or flying fox populations (such as those that refer to the zip-line apparatus known as a ‘flying-fox’ or businesses or products with ‘flying fox’ in the title), after which 984 unique articles remained to be analysed.\",\r\n        \"The media sample was then read, catalogued manually, and cross-compared by the lead author in order to identify and track prominent concepts, differences, and themes. Next, both authors manually cross-coded a pilot sample (n = 40) of the media corpus for specific types of content to confirm and to extend the preliminary thematic analysis. Articles then were coded for:•mention of horses, flying foxes/fruit bats or Hendra virus•mention of debates about flying fox control•report of distal ecological causes (loss of natural habitat) for the emergence of Hendra virus or the possibility of viral mutation•mention of ignorance about Hendra virus amongst scientists, healthcare providers or members of the public•reference to government inaction as a factor contributing to the Hendra problem•reference to people's health and welfare not being high enough on the political agenda.\\n\",\r\n        \"These codes were both emergent and informed by similar media analyses (for example Gollust & Lantz, 2009; Washer, 2004). Because Hendra events tend to occur seasonally (from winter-spring), the calendar year was chosen as the unit of analysis. The results from coding were then tabulated in matrix form, cross referenced and displayed visually as descriptive statistics in charts to aid interpretation. Regular discussions among the authors served to generate additional enquires and to validate insights as they emerged. This approach is consistent with ethnographic content analysis, a qualitative research method for interpreting documents within the context of their use, which enables researchers to generate insights about how documents promote particular ways of understanding, interpreting and responding to an issue or event such as the emergence of a new disease from both numerical and narrative data (Altheide, 1987).\",\r\n        \"With these concepts and types of content in mind, our analysis of the 984 articles proceeded through several cycles of immersion and crystallization of insights – a research process comprised of repeated readings and comparisons across and between news-sources, discussions amongst the authors, periods of testing of alternate explanations, and then re-immersion within the research materials (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999).\",\r\n        \"Given that flying foxes were first identified as the natural host of Hendra virus in 1996 (Young et al., 1996) it is surprising to find that until 2011, the media paid little attention to the link between Hendra virus and flying fox populations. In previous years reports about flying foxes tended not to mention Hendra, but focussed on the impact of flying fox populations on horticultural enterprises and residential areas. In these reports first hand testimony and events on the ground were used to framepublic perceptions of this animal's protected status, and the bureaucratic and ‘hands off’ approach of the government agencies to this issue. At the same time reports that are primarily about Hendra virus during this period typically focus on ‘unfolding’ zoonotic outbreaks, suspected cases of Hendra infection, quarantine orders, human exposure and disease, experimental treatments, and the impacts of these incidents on individuals. It is not until the unprecedented number of Hendra outbreaks in 2011 that the relationship between Hendra virus infection and contact with flying foxes becomes an item of sustained interest in our media sample.\",\r\n        \"In 2011 with 17 zoonotic events across two states, 21 dead horses, and upwards of 70 people potentially exposed to the virus through their dealings with sick and dying animals, discussions about the potential role of flying foxes as Hendra carriers became firmly established as a central part of the media discourse. Although the relative prominence given to different types of nonhuman animal changed across the years sampled. By 2011 news about Hendra virus and flying foxes suddenly began to be described in reference to each other in the majority of news reports (Table 1).\",\r\n        \"The nonhuman species most often linked to Hendra virus in the media sample was the horse, both as a victim of zoonotic outbreaks and as the intermediate host for human infection (See Fig. 2\\n). As the link between Hendra and flying foxes was given greater prominence in the media, representations of the position and status of flying foxes and horses also began to change. An article in The Sydney Morning Herald in 2009 provides a typical example of the more cautious approach taken in the earlier years sampled:Hendra is not highly contagious but is very often fatal. Carried by fruit bats, it infects horses, which can then transmit the disease to humans through bodily fluids. (Marriner, 2009, p.2)\\n\",\r\n        \"In this quote flying foxes are identified as the source of the virus and the role of horses as intermediate hosts is well defined, as is the mode of transmission for human infection. At this stage the media are at pains to make it clear that Hendra virus is a fatal and devastating disease of horses that can, on occasion, infect and kill people who work in equine industries. Flying foxes are not portrayed as an immediate or direct risk to human health but as an environmental factor, they are to be understood as the inadvertent reservoir of equine infection.\",\r\n        \"Although horses continue to be a feature of Hendra news stories, by 2011 it was not uncommon for some subtle distinctions in the natural history of the disease to be dispensed with. Rather than intermediate hosts, horses began to be portrayed as victims of a dangerous ‘bat-borne’ disease; their role as intermediate hosts is implied rather than explicitly stated, as shown by this 2011 report in The Australian:The outbreak of Hendra virus that has killed six horses and exposed 26 people to infection has reached the outskirts of Brisbane and is the most virulent in the known history of the fruit bat-borne disease. (Barrett, 2011a, p.3)\\n\",\r\n        \"At the same time as the media start to problematize the role of flying foxes in Hendra outbreaks column inches begin to be devoted to identifying the source of each equine case. Reports begin to note forensically significant details, often with direct quotes from the investigating scientists, much in the same way a crime reporter might ask a detective to profile a likely suspect and then “set the scene” of a murder.“The infected horse was grazing in a small paddock containing flowering and fruiting trees, where flying foxes were active.” (“National snapshot: Almost 50 waiting for Hendra results,” 2011, p.14)\\n\",\r\n        \"These descriptions of ‘place’ resonate closely with public health recommendations given to horse owners to place feeding bins and water troughs under cover and keep their horses out of paddocks with flowering or fruiting trees, if possible. Yet translating this advice into practice sometimes only served to increase people's sense of anxiety and powerlessness, and their anger with the government. For example one property owner in Gayndah told The Courier-Mail:“The head vet of Queensland is saying, ‘Keep your horses away from the bats’. Well, I'm doing that but the bats aren't keeping away from my horses” Mrs Robertson said. “Fifty thousand infected bats are pooping on my horses, their grass and their water every day.” (Robertson & Hall, 2011, p.8)\\n\",\r\n        \"Public acknowledgement of scientific uncertainty about Hendra virus was also a feature of the media coverage in 2011, heightening the sense that events were out of control (Table 1). In previous years, statements about expert uncertainty were either general reflections about the lack of knowledge of how horses acquired the virus, or they had a sharp clinical focus – describing how little experience health professions had in dealing with human Hendra infections. The former were typically framed as a matter of scientific curiosity, the later a matter of critical urgency that had immediate impact on people's lives.\",\r\n        \"But during 2011 the media spotlight on Hendra returned to unanswered questions surrounding the health and management of other species. Even as scientists and veterinarians were described as being “baffled” by Hendra virus, they were required to publically speculate on two issues: the implications of finding a pet dog with a naturally acquired infection, and theorise as to why there were so many equine cases that year. That scientists interviewed by the media appeared to be taken aback by the discovery of the canine case drew this response from the Queensland Premier, at the time, Anna Bligh:“The scientists themselves are being very honest with us. They're telling us that science does not fully understand every part of this disease. We, as human beings, have had to cope with that in our past, we've conquered diseases before, I believe we will conquer this one.” (Miles, MacDonald, & Helbig, 2011, p.2)\\n\",\r\n        \"Throughout the same period members of the public were increasingly portrayed as being forced to deal with the effects and risks of Hendra outbreaks with inadequate information about the disease. Reflecting the statements of the experts, the concerns of the public expressed in the media were, for the most part, articulated around what people should do to protect themselves and their animals from Hendra events, particularly as pet dogs now appeared to catch the disease, and therefore might be a risk to humans. As reports emerged that the infected dog had been destroyed and the media sought to highlight existing scientific literature that showed that dogs, cats and guinea pigs could be infected with the virus under “controlled” laboratory conditions, repeated assurances by health authorities that there was minimal risk of catching Hendra from animals other than horses began to wear thin. With this single canine infection, in the words of one reporter: “the bats’ presence has become all the more sinister”. (MacDonald, 2011, p.5)\",\r\n        \"Despite increasing attention to the link between Hendra virus and flying fox populations, for the most part media reports of the Hendra outbreak in 2011 infrequently gave any consideration to non-proximal factors for disease emergence. While earlier reports, in 2007 and 2010, regularly pointed to land clearing and environmental events such as prolonged drought, floods and cyclones as explanations for flying foxes congregating in residential and agricultural areas, and approximately one in four articles describe habitat loss as inevitably increasing the risk of Hendra jumping species, there is a clear and precipitous decline in such reports in 2011. Of the 440 reports analysed from 2011, only one in 10 has any mention of these types of ecological drivers for disease emergence or the increasing prevalence of Hendra outbreaks (Table 1). Indeed by 2011 the media focus is almost always on events ‘as they happen’ – the vast majority of reports doing little more than point to the presence of flying foxes and horses in the same locality as the most important characteristic of a causal story of disease or of public health risk.\",\r\n        \"Finally cross-coding the media sample revealed that issues surrounding the risk of Hendra virus to human health became a dominant feature of reports that specifically address, or at least in some way refer to, the continuing controversy about the control of flying fox populations (Fig. 2). While the frequency with which media reports describe the level of dissatisfaction with the government's policy of flying fox protection remains much the same from 2010 onwards, in 2011 heightened uncertainty about who and what was at risk from Hendra virus increasingly became a factor of some importance to assessments of the Queensland Government's response to the unfolding situation. As the lack of knowledge about Hendra virus became an increasingly prominent feature of debates about what should be done about the encroachment of flying fox populations on human settlement and agriculture, so did assertions in the media by members of the public and politicians that concern for the health and welfare of people affected be flying foxes was being ignored in deference to the interests of another species.\",\r\n        \"In 2011 key features of the justification for the policy of not moving or culling flying foxes increasingly became contested in the media – particularly the claim that flying fox numbers were in decline and the claim that attempts to disperse flying fox colonies would spread the disease. For those wanting to repeal protective legislation, assertions that flying fox numbers were not falling could be backed up by simple first hand observation. People just had to come to affected areas and look for themselves. What they would find, according to the Mayor of Charters Towers, was:“These bats aren't endangered, they are in plague numbers and more and more communities are feeling the effects of bat infestation.” (Gilham, 2011, p.5)\\n\",\r\n        \"Proponents of policy change to protect the public against bat-borne diseases also dismissed in the media claims that culling or dispersing flying foxes would spread Hendra virus. Even as the Premier or a government spokespersons re-iterated publically that they would: “respond to the outbreak of Hendra virus on the basis of the best-informed science that we can access” (Barrett, 2011b, p.7), what constituted evidence became a point of contention. Those seeking to remove protections told the media that current policies were based on a set of (unproven or unsound) assumptions. In support of this, scientists themselves, as is their fashion, acknowledged the limits of scientific certainty – noting that they did not know how horses caught the virus, and that they lacked incontestable proof that disrupting bat colonies would lead to its spread – something admitted by the chief veterinarian of Queensland (to the significant discomfort of the previous Labor government). In contrast, politicians supporting the ‘rights’ of land-owners to government protection from flying foxes, such as the independent Member of Parliament, Bob Katter, were able to tell press conferences that fruit bats had been removed from towns for years before the current ban without causing an outbreak. And of claims by scientists, health authorities and government spokesperson that these types of interventions could heighten zoonotic risks, Katter noted in the Townsville Bulletin:“If you were looking for a more stupid claim you couldn’t find it… we’ve got empirical evidence on our side, all they’ve got is conjecture on theirs”. (Galloway, 2011, p.15)\\n\",\r\n        \"A prominent advocate for bat culling known for his theatrical turn of phrase, one week earlier Katter framed the deeper issues in the following terms in The Courier-Mail:“If it comes to a choice of our children dying or us going out there and killing flying foxes, then I have a very grave moral problem about not going out there and killing the flying foxes,” Mr Katter said. (Miles, Helbig, & Michael, 2011, p.11)\\n\",\r\n        \"Pointedly, a number of other politicians even claimed that calls by scientist and the government for more research on Hendra was further evidence that current policies put the needs of flying foxes above the health and welfare of ‘real’ people:”Why don’t we, as an immediate first response, reduce flying fox numbers? … Why is the government throwing money at research, which will not protect families now?” (“Hendra virus claims another victim,” 2011, p.3)\\n\",\r\n        \"The newsworthiness of the Hendra outbreak in 2011 and the growing sense of uncertainty expressed by those charged with managing the situation created a media forum in which previously distinct health and environmental issues related to flying foxes became redefined as one and the same problem. Consequently, even as a large pool of research funding was announced for projects related to protecting people and communities from Hendra virus, this only served to highlight the absence of direct government action.\",\r\n        \"This research has several limitations. First given our focus on reactions in selected news media to zoonotic events, health communications and public policy, we were not able to capture the nuance that a broader analysis of press releases, policy documents and the grey literature on Hendra virus and flying fox population control would illuminate. Second we did not seek to include the political leanings, funding relationships and commercial affiliations of the news organisations examined in the analysis. In this regard Australia, and especially Queensland, does not have a competitive and diverse media market. Ownership of news media is highly concentrated. Aside from the news provided by the Government funded national broadcaster, the ABC, many major towns and cites are served by only one newspaper. This may have coloured how statements by member of the public, politicians, scientists and other experts were framed and presented in the media. Finally our focus was on Hendra virus in Australia. Without further research it is doubtful our findings can be generalised to the coverage of other bat-borne emergent zoonotic diseases such as Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh or SARs-like corona virus in South-East Asia.\",\r\n        \"What this study reveals is the extent to which the media can be used to construct the risks of Hendra virus not as a scientific problem but as a moral question; that is, a problem that requires moral solutions. Given that any government measure aimed at protecting public health involves moral judgements that are legitimated through political processes (Leichter, 2003; Oliver, 2006), the infectious risk posed by wild animals to agricultural production and human populations is undoubtedly both a political and a moral issue. But the moral dimensions of this issue, and the development of policy responses to it, are deeply contested and heavily influenced by media representations of the link between human health, animals and the environment. Our findings illustrate the potential for health communications around emerging infectious disease risks to become entangled in other political agendas and conflict with widely held human values, with implications for the public's likelihood of supporting public policy and risk management strategies that require behavioural change or seek to address the ecological drivers of incidence. More broadly, our research illustrates the value of methodologies from the social sciences to expand the relevance of the One World One Health public health agenda to reflect lived realities and the needs of communities.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,0\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,1\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,3\": \"problem\",\r\n

military is recognized for deploying its service members throughout nearly every continent in the world. Deployments range from small-scale training missions to politically and militarily significant exercises with worldwide joint and combined operational units. One of the largest combined exercises in the Pacific Command is Thailand\\'s \"Cobra Gold.\" This 2-week multilateral exercise allows engaged military forces to work together in a joint/combined environment to conduct numerous operations on land, at sea, and in the air. The 2003 Cobra Gold exercise included ϳ12,000 troops from participating nations, with 5,200 of those being from the U.S. Armed Forces. The specific focus of the 2003 exercise was to enhance peace enforcement, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief operations. 1 As plans for Cobra Gold 2003 were unfolding, however, the world was anxiously watching the spread of another powerful force. In February 2003, atypical pneumonia with high mortality rates was seen in the Guangdong province of China and reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Later called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a newly recognized, highly pathogenic strain of coronavirus was found to be causal. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although SARS transmission was not recognized in the country of Thailand before Cobra Gold 2003, a small number of contained imported cases were documented. In anticipation of Cobra Gold 2003, the Kingdom of Thailand was concerned regarding the potential for participants to pass through or come from countries with known SARS transmission. To ease these concerns, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), with an 8-year history of surveillance and diagnosis of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) within active duty continental United States and deployed forces, was tasked with conducting laboratory-based, active surveillance for respiratory illnesses (including SARS) during the exercise, with the intent of early recognition and response. 7, 8 As concerns over SARS importation were eased with implementation of surveillance, valuable information on circulating respiratory pathogens during such an exercise was collected.',\r\n        \"With coordination and logistic support from the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) (a joint U.S. Army-Royal Thai Army research facility located in Bangkok since 1958), respiratory illness surveillance was initiated by NHRC. AFRIMS has conducted routine diarrhea surveillance during Cobra Gold for many years, and researchers were able to easily accommodate respiratory surveillance in this exercise. In addition to the support received from AFRIMS, two main appointed medical care units, i.e., Fort Thanarat (located in the Hua Hin area, southwest of Bangkok) and Camp Samae San (located in Pattaya Beach, southeast of Bangkok), were selected as collection stations because of their U.S. military force proximity. Individual U.S. aid stations throughout Thailand were sent official notification of the surveillance through message traffic; this instructed the aid stations to send all patients meeting the FRI case definition to Fort Thanarat or Camp Samae San. The FRI case definition was oral temperature of Ն100.5°F and a respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing) or any diagnosed pneumonia. The surveillance was conducted for 2 weeks for personnel within the political borders of Thailand, from the official commencement of the exercise to its completion.\",\r\n        'Supplies, including viral transport medium, swabs (sterile Dacron), preprinted subject identification labels, FRI log sheets, and informed consent/case forms, were provided to both units. Before commencement of the exercise, a NHRC representative conducted training on data and specimen collection procedures. To record the number of personnel under surveillance and the number of those who presented with FRI symptoms, the clinicians at each medical care unit completed a daily summary form. Individuals who presented meeting the FRI case definition were asked to complete an informed consent/case form and to permit a throat swab. Travel and contact information was also requested for potential categorization as a \"suspect SARS case,\" 2 which required implementation of respiratory isolation precautions with immediate evaluation.',\r\n        \"Diagnostic specimens were collected with a sterile Dacron swab and placed directly into viral transport medium. A preprinted subject identification label was placed on the vial, and the vial was immediately placed in a Ϫ70°C freezer or liquid nitrogen tank. Identical preprinted labels were placed on the case report form and the FRI log sheet. Once the exercise ended, Camp Samae San and Fort Thanarat transported all specimens to AFRIMS, and shipment to the NHRC Respiratory Disease Laboratory was arranged.\",\r\n        \"Samples received at the NHRC Respiratory Disease Laboratory were processed in both the classic virology laboratory, with cell culture techniques (A549 and RMK cells), 7 and in the molecular laboratory, with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase-PCR methods. Testing was performed for influenza A, influenza B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, coronaviruses (229E and OC43), rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus. All samples positive for influenza A were typed with four additional primer sets (N1, N3, H1, and H3) . A portion of the H3 gene was sequenced for all influenza A-positive samples, for phylogenetic comparison. Because viral transport medium was used to collect the specimens, no testing was conducted for bacterial pathogens. If SARS coronavirus testing had been required, NHRC would have used the real-time, reverse transcriptase-PCR assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with validation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 9\",\r\n        \"The number of troops under surveillance during the exercise was estimated to average 4,800 over a 2-week period; 17 patients were seen who met the case definition, for an attack rate of 0.18 FRI cases per 100 recruit-weeks. Sixteen of the 17 patients provided a diagnostic specimen. The average age of these 16 individuals was 27 years; all were male, seven were U.S. Marine Corps, seven were U.S. Army, one was U.S. Air Force, and one was not determined. The average symptom duration was 3.7 days; one of the 16 patients was hospitalized with pneumonia. None of the patients had a history of asthma, and all except one had been vaccinated with the influenza vaccine within the past 12 months (two unknown). Six of the 16 individuals were smokers, with an average of 2.2 pack-years.\",\r\n        \"Of the 16 diagnostic specimens received, seven (44%) tested positive for influenza A, 2 (13%) for coronavirus OC43, 2 (13%) for respiratory syncytial virus, and 1 (6%) for rhinovirus. The remaining four (25%) were negative. No case met the case definition for a suspect SARS case during the surveillance; therefore, patient isolation and urgent investigations were not required. Of the individuals meeting the case definition for FRI, only one had significant symptoms necessitating further evaluation and chest radiographs. This individual was one of the two respiratory syncytial virus-positive individuals. Sequence analysis demonstrated that all seven influenza A strains were more closely related to the Fujian/411 lineage than the Panama, as illustrated in Figure 1 .\",\r\n        \"Concern over potential SARS transmission provided the momentum for cooperation and facilitation necessary to conduct this surveillance. Although no SARS suspect case was identified, valuable information was gathered regarding circulating respiratory pathogens among our deployed troops in this setting. Most interesting, influenza A was identified for 44% of the presenting patients (7 of 16 patients). Given the potential for genetic recombination and drift of influenza A virus and concern over the potential for another influenza pandemic similar in scope to the devastating pandemic of 1918, the global community is renewing efforts to improve global influenza surveillance. Particularly in regions of the Far East where living conditions are often in close proximity to avian and swine populations, the risk for human acquisition of recombined influenza viruses with increased pathogenic potential is real. Indeed, of the influenza A isolates sequenced, all were found to be closely related to the Fujian strain (Fig. 1) , which was the predominant influenza strain seen globally in the subsequent 2003/2004 influenza season but was not covered by the 2003/2004 influenza vaccine preparation. 10, 11 A weakness of this surveillance was lack of data indicating the percentage capture of those meeting the case definition. Given the great concern over SARS transmission, however, we are confident that capture of FRI was better than it would have been in years without this concern. In addition, the surveillance period was relatively short, indicating that individuals in the presymptomatic stages of infection likely came back to the United States. Given this risk, real-time knowledge of pathogens in circulation would be useful. To this end, field implementation of diagnostic technologies, such as classic PCR or real-time PCR methods (such as with the LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana), would be a valuable addition to surveillance such as this in remote regions.\",\r\n        \"Critical surveillance for infectious agents causing FRI during overseas military exercises can be conducted, although logistical barriers must be overcome. Given concern over emerging pathogens such as SARS and the known potential for emergence of newly pathogenic influenza strains such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, opportunities for laboratorybased surveillance for respiratory pathogens among our deployed troops should be sought. Valuable information on the epidemiological features of these pathogens will be gained as we monitor the potential importation of emerging pathogens into the United States.\"\r\n      ],\r\n

of 2019, a war without gunpowder has begun in China. Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) from Wuhan city has now spread to the whole country and even the world [1]. The major routes of the coronavirus infection are the respiratory droplets, close contact transmission, and also when exposed to high concentrations of aerosol in a relatively closed environment for a long time [2]. The incubation period of COVID-19 is up to 24 days. The most common symptoms were fever and cough, and some severe cases can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. The Chinese government has initiated a first-level response to major public health emergencies, mobilized the whole country to fight against the epidemic, made comprehensive deployments, and implemented the strongest and strictest prevention and control measures. By the end of March, the epidemic situation has been under control across China. However, the pandemic of COVID-19 is global now.\",\r\n        \"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the malignancy with the fourth highest prevalence among females and fifth among males in China [4]. CRC patients were generally in poor immunity and physical fitness, which are susceptible to COVID-19. A prospective cohort study has found that cancer patients were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and had a worse prognosis than those without tumors [5].\",\r\n        \"During this particular period, most hospitals have suspended or postponed outpatient and elective surgery. Therefore, how to deal with CRC patients is challenging and essential. As follows, we introduce our single center's experience in the management of CRC patients during COVID-19 outbreak and present a series of issues of our clinical work (Table 1).\",\r\n        \"Not as the previous, all outpatient clinics request appointments now. CRC patients should make an appointment in advance, and only one family member is allowed to accompany to prevent cross-infection.\",\r\n        \"The medical workers, patients and families need to strengthen their own protection, such as wearing surgical masks, goggles, and so on. We also pay attention to the disinfection of outpatient equipment and the environment.\",\r\n        \"At the clinic, a rigorous investigation of epidemiological history and clinical symptoms is needed. Patients with a history of living or traveling in the affected area, close contacts with a confirmed or probable case, or having fever and respiratory symptoms, should be checked during pre-diagnosis. And then, if suspected COVID-19 manifestations, the patient should be sent to the fever clinic. If a suspected or confirmed case is diagnosed, the patient shall be immediately quarantined and reported.\",\r\n        \"At the outpatient, we choose simple and convenient regimen, and also establish a long prescription policy to facilitate patients to receive drugs for 2 to 3 months at a time, to reduce the times of visiting.\",\r\n        \"The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend that adjuvant chemotherapy should be started as soon as possible after recovery, generally about 3 weeks after CRC operation, and no later than 2 months [6]. A meta-analysis of 15 410 CRC patients showed that the start of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was delayed every 4 weeks, patients' overall survival time and disease-free survival time will be significantly reduced [7]. Therefore, we recommend postponing adjuvant chemotherapy appropriately at the local hospital as the first choice. Moreover, we prefer the three-week CapeOX regimen to biweekly FOLFOX regimen, so that we can minimize the chance of cross-infection. Oral capecitabine monotherapy also could be used as much as possible. In addition, we recommend that the patients can contact the physicians to reduce the treatment intensity and switch to oral therapy.\",\r\n        \"During the epidemic, many hospitals suspended radiotherapy. The Chinese FOWARC Trial showed that no significant difference in outcomes was found between mFOLFOX6 without radiotherapy and fluorouracil with radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer [8]. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone with the mFOLFOX6 regimen is also an option.\",\r\n        \"For patients with metastatic CRC, Multi-Disciplinary Treatment (MDT) is the best choice. If the condition is stable, the original chemotherapy regimen can be maintained for another 1-2 cycles until the MDT outpatient restore. If there is obvious progression, we recommend online MDT clinics or communicating with physicians via WeChat or telephone to change the regimen.\",\r\n        \"Undoubtedly, traditional Chinese medicine has certain effects on improving the physical condition of CRC patients, which can reduce the side effects of chemotherapy and improve the quality of life [9]. Considering the patients' resistance during chemotherapy is relatively low, we also recommend regular thymosin to improve immunity as prescribed [10].\",\r\n        \"CRC surgeons should control the routine operation to reduce the patient's exposure time in the hospital [11]. For CRC patients with mass bleeding, perforation, or obstruction, emergency surgery should be considered, and COVID-19 infection needs to be ruled out before.\",\r\n        \"Endoscopic surgery is recommended for early-stage CRC when it is completely removed clearly with good histological features, and no additional surgical treatment is required. Whether surgery delay affects survival remains controversial for advanced CRC. We prefer to expand neoadjuvant therapy indications for low to moderate locally advanced rectal cancer. And we try to conduct surgery for advanced colon cancer as early as possible. A detailed investigation and a comprehensive examination (chest CT or viral nucleic acid test) should be performed to exclude COVID-19 before elective surgery. In addition, we also do not recommend to perform colorectal and liver resections simultaneously at the current situation, so as to avoid a prolonged hospital stay and increased risk of infection.\",\r\n        \"At the surgical ward, we prefer minimally invasive surgery plus a perioperative program of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) as the best treatment strategy, which could accelerate patient recovery and shorten hospital stay [12].\",\r\n        \"The hospital should strictly implement the National Health Commission's requirements for infection control in medical institutions [13]. Ordinary patients who underwent CRC resection can be transferred to the general ward after surgery. It is necessary to reduce the movement of accompanying staff and personnel. Patients with postoperative fever should be carefully identified and isolated according to the suspected COVID-19 criteria [2]. And then suspected or confirmed patients should be transferred to a designated negative pressure isolation monitoring room for single room isolation.\",\r\n        \"CRC and COVID-19 are double blows to patients. Many patients have mental health problems of anxiety and depression, so we should give positive psychological support during the epidemic. We inform that the prognosis of CRC is not so bad, and even with recurrence, a considerable part of the patients will be cured when metastases are detected and resected early [14]. Stoma patients are also encouraged to communicate with families and friends, learn to self-regulate bad moods, and actively integrate into society. At the same time, we also inform the patients that they will not be infected if actively protect, and the epidemic situation is getting better now, which will return to normal soon. Even if the treatment is appropriately delayed, it will not affect the treatment effect. At present, several public institutions and domestic hospitals have launched psychological hotline services, and we recommend patients could contact when needed.\",\r\n        \"A healthy lifestyle is especially important for CRC patients. Studies have shown that smokers have a significantly increased risk of developing and dying from CRC compared with never-smokers, and heavy drinking also increases the risk of developing CRC [15]. We recommend CRC patients a healthy and balanced lifestyle diet, avoiding high fat and low fiber diet, reducing the intake of red meat and processed meat. The American Gastroenterological Association has recommended calcium supplements for the primary or secondary prevention of colon cancer, so we also recommend appropriate intake of calcium-rich food such as dairy products [16]. CRC patients also need to appropriately increase the intake of cellulose and decrease irritating and too much oily food. Stoma patients can properly consume dairy products and vegetables to reduce the odor at the stoma. In addition, we also suggest that during the epidemic, patients can arrange indoor physical exercise under the guidance of the physicians, avoiding prolonged bed rest, which can promote the recovery of intestinal function and prevent deep vein thrombosis.\",\r\n        \"Recently, many health organizers have opened public-interest online lectures and free mobile applications for different patient groups, to provide disease education and answer questions online. Furthermore, several university hospitals have also opened up various online clinics, including online fever clinics, psychological clinics, specialist clinics and online MDT clinics. In addition, we also have established several follow-up WeChat groups for CRC patients. When CRC patients have questions, they can get medical advice quickly from multiple experts at home.\",\r\n        \"For patients who need to be reviewed after CRC surgery during the epidemic, we recommend that the review time can be appropriately postponed. We encourage patients to complete routine review projects at the nearest medical institution. After they obtain the review results, it is recommended to adopt an online network method for consultation.\",\r\n        \"In summary, our current clinical work model has to be changed due to COVID-19 outbreak, which includes the above outpatient, inpatient, psychological treatment and health education.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,8\":

Cases, however, situate the knowledge in real-world contexts. Here, the cases provide the primary occasion for learning, rather than serve secondarily as illustrations or applications. Nor are cases merely “teasers” or “hooks” for opening a presentation of abstract content. Rather, the cases become integral to the structure of learning.\",\r\n        \"Contextualization fosters two major effects. First, it enhances learning by providing associations that facilitate memory storage, retention, and retrieval: the knowledge is more meaningful. Second, it also helps motivate learning. Cases convey that the knowledge is relevant or useful, sometimes by showing its human dimension. Such contextual and human connections seem especially important (in today's culture) in fostering interest among women/girls and minorities, as well as among nonmajors. Such benefits indicate a vital role for careful selection of cases to fit particular groups of students, their contexts (age, locality, culture), interests, and levels of background knowledge.\",\r\n        \"CBL, however, may not provide a comprehensive and organized view of the knowledge, typically conveyed in didactic approaches. That is, the formal structure of a substantial domain of knowledge may not be evident when knowledge is accumulated by piecemeal sampling. (For example, a case profiling only a few organelles in the cell may eclipse awareness of the full diversity of organelles. A focus on just the nitrogen cycle alone may forsake a broader awareness of other mineral cycles and their general role in ecosystems.) Nevertheless, a carefully constructed curriculum may use complementary cases to cover standard curricular content (see Schwartz et al., 1997). On the other hand, some evidence indicates that learning occurs primarily, or most vividly, through exemplars (Kolodner et al., 1996; Gentner et al., 2003; Gentner and Colhoun, 2008). One case or example serves as a model, or paradigm, for interpreting other similar cases (Kuhn, 1970, pp. 23, 187–191). A well-articulated sample may be as valuable as comprehensive coverage.\",\r\n        \"For more on the benefits and limits of CBL generally, see Barnes et al. (1994) and Lunberg et al. (1999). For sample textbooks using a case structure, see (at the undergraduate level) Postlethwait and Hopson (2003) and Schwartz et al. (1997) and (at the secondary level) Leonard et al. (1998, 2008) and American Chemical Society (2006).\",\r\n        \"Another way to engage students in their own learning is posing problems for students to solve. These embody the rationale for learning, which is elsewise typically based solely on the authority of the instructor (or, by default, a textbook). Typically, such problems are rooted in cases (although they need not be, or the case itself may be quite minimalistic). Not all CBL is problem based, however. Cases may function merely as narratives, or as a setting for knowledge. This may be so even when a story (say, the case of an important historical discovery) helps students learn how a scientist encountered and solved a problem.\",\r\n        \"In PBL, the problem is posed to the student, who then takes an active role in solving it. Active learning—itself expressed in various ways—is widely recognized as enhancing motivation and depth and persistence of learning (Bonwell and Eison, 1991; Michael, 2006; see section on autonomy below). The introduction of cogent problems thus tends to amplify the basic virtues of using cases themselves—provided the problems are framed in ways relevant to the student. Almost any declarative knowledge can be rephrased as a question or problem. However, just as a case should be judiciously selected, a problem should be properly framed and contextualized if it is indeed to be motivational. The teacher who begins, without context, “Today we study the pancreas; now, what is a pancreas?,” does not engage student interest. Indeed, students can easily spot a rhetorical problem or pseudoproblem. “Cookbook” problems are just like cookbook labs. A teacher who needs to institute substantial external motivators for students to complete work, for example, has probably not found the proper problem to inspire active, student-centered learning. One may consider framing and contextualizing problems as one of the primary instructional skills for this mode of teaching.\",\r\n        \"In addition, engagement with problems introduces a deeper layer of thinking: about the generation of knowledge, about the nature or quality of evidence, about reasoning, and so on. It may foster a habit of curiosity or of questioning assumptions. Problems tend to promote reflective thinking. Posing problems provides an opportunity, but an instructor must also highlight these features in student activities and assessments.\",\r\n        \"Cases may certainly combine a case narrative and problems. One effective method interrupts a story or punctuates it with a series of well-contextualized problems (Hagen et al., 1996; Herreid, 2005).\",\r\n        \"For more on the benefits and limits of PBL generally, see Duch et al. (2001), Dochy et al. (2003), Hmelo-Silver (2004), and Major and Palmer (2001). Also relevant is the substantial literature on the role of anomalies, discrepant events, and cognitive dissonance in stimulating learning.\",\r\n        \"The pedagogical function of cases or problems can vary. In a widely used model (Barrows, 1986), the problem is considered primarily a vehicle for learning content, which ultimately answers the given question or solves the problem at hand. In other cases, the problem engages students in practicing or developing problem-solving skills through firsthand experience. (Here, one should plan on providing a framework for students to learn new skills, not just exercise existing abilities.) Both styles, appropriately adapted, may also help foster deeper understanding of the nature of science (or of scientific practice, how science works, or the context of science broadly speaking). However, learning about the nature of science should be both explicit and reflective (Craven, 2002; Schwartz et al., 2004; Scharmann et al., 2005; Seker and Welsh, 2005). That is, one should pose problems specifically about the nature of science and engage students in discussion. These three aims are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Some cases may well integrate these (e.g., see Hagen et al., 1996; Allchin, 2012).\",\r\n        \"The ultimate aim of education will be reflected in—and communicated to students most vividly through—the forms of evaluation. Initiating efforts to teach problem-solving skills or understanding of the nature of science may well require a shift in modes of assessment and/or grading standards. Teachers will surely benefit in any event by reflecting how the learning objectives of their courses are coupled to the ways they ask students to demonstrate or exhibit such learning.\",\r\n        \"The problems students encounter can be of two general kinds: problems in which students can use knowledge that already exists or problems that involve research that generates new knowledge. (New, here, is defined relative to the student.) Repairing a car engine is quite different from designing one. Diagnosing a patient with an already documented disease is quite different from studying the etiology of a wholly new disease. The terms investigation, research, or problem solving are all potentially ambiguous, denoting either alternative. But research in solving a problem is substantively different from research that generates the knowledge used to solve such problems: crudely the difference between technology and science.\",\r\n        \"If the learning objectives emphasize content and/or its cultural contexts, one can ostensibly focus on applications alone. Students will draw on a known repertoire of knowledge. (This is typical of problem cases or scenarios in medicine, law, business, engineering, applied ethics, and other professional training—areas in which PBL and CBL first emerged. All are based on precedent, even if the cases invite creatively recombining existing ideas.)\",\r\n        \"However, if one wants students to learn about the process of science or research, the problems should be about developing knowledge: exploring genuine unknowns (for the student) and creating knowledge, not merely finding or interpreting known facts. Students should experience “science in the making,” as opposed to “ready-made science” (Latour, 1987). Learning about the role of empirical evidence as a foundation of scientific knowledge is critical to shaping one dimension of epistemological understanding: Is knowledge justified by omniscient authority or evidence (Schommer, 1990)?\",\r\n        \"The knowledge-generating/knowledge-applying distinction does not currently seem widely discussed in treatments of CBL and PBL. Yet failure to recognize the distinction can foster misleading impressions about the aims, benefits, or structure of PBL in science education.\",\r\n        \"Cases may be historical or contemporary, or completely abstracted from any historical context. Here, the relevant dimension (using “history” as a label) is whether the problem being considered has been solved or remains unsolved. The status of the problem's solution is critical to the possible epistemic lessons about how knowledge is developed.\",\r\n        \"Contemporary cases often appeal to students by being relevant, current, or fashionable. They convey that science is happening now, affording a sense of immediacy or authenticity (Wong et al., 2008). Students may even encounter some cases in the news (relevant just to the degree that students seriously attend to current events). Current problem cases that focus on the context of science can offer rehearsals for participating in personal decision making or social policy in future life. However, care should be taken in such cases to enrich the learning rather than merely elicit and reinforce existing perspectives. Ironically, evaluating the epistemic process in such cases is problematic. One needs time to know whether a proposed solution ultimately turned out to be reliable or well considered.\",\r\n        \"Historical cases have their own virtues (Conant, 1947; Nash, 1951; Hagen et al., 1996, pp. v–vii; Allchin, 1997, 2012). First, the benchmark content knowledge in standard science curricula originated long ago. The strategic pedadgogical constructivist will thus look to history for clues about how such concepts may be constructed from earlier facts and perspectives, as well as how they may be alternatively conceived or criticized. Imagine the sense of validation when informing a student that the concept he or she just developed is the same concept discovered earlier by a famous scientist! Second, historical narratives are prime opportunities for teaching about scientific practice, because historians are able to render the historical context, bringing together experimental details with cultural events and perspectives and scientific disputes. These are the elements for recreating science in the making. Students may participate in (re)generating knowledge at a conceptual level corresponding to their own.\",\r\n        \"Third, history seems essential for conveying certain lessons about the nature of science, most notably about cultural bias in scientific ideas, conceptual change, and uncertainty and error (or how scientific knowledge—new findings, in particular—can be uncertain and/or provisional) (Solomon et al., 1992; Irwin, 2000). Tentativeness of scientific knowledge, for example, has been a pervasive learning goal in science education for many decades (Lederman et al., 1998), and constitutes a significant dimension of epistemological belief—the stability of scientific knowledge (Schommer, 1990). To learn about conceptual change, however, one ideally engages in and experiences the change. Here, a case should be properly contextualized in history, not rationally reconstructed (Allchin, 1996, 2004). To enable informative contrast of a reasonable “before” with an unexpected “after,” the whole problem-solving episode should be amenable to retrospective analysis. It should be historical. In a similar way, to appreciate gender or racial bias or other ways that cultural perspectives may sometimes become blindly naturalized in science, one should be at a relatively remote vantage point to see the culture as culture. History and historical perspective are indispensable for such nature-of-science lessons.\",\r\n        \"Finally, historical cases tend to change less with time. This year's “hot” topic will be passé soon, and the work assembling and refining a new contemporary case will start all over again. Cost–benefit ratio of teacher preparation may be considered.\",\r\n        \"Does the problem have one solution (possibly hidden) or many possible solutions? That is, in terms of the student's problem solving, is the process close-ended or open-ended? (Or, in terms of the literature on creativity, is the cognitive process convergent or divergent?) Each type shapes student motivation and an understanding of science (Cliff and Nesbitt, 2005). A problem for which there is a single known solution places students in a vulnerable position. Anytime a teacher “fishes” for a right answer, the responder risks being “wrong.” Such situations tend to alienate students—typically expressed as silence or acquiescence. Similarly, a problem framed with an expected solution can diminish rather than enhance student motivation. Some students, of course, revel in puzzle-solving. Others feel threatened. Close-ended problems can also (alas) foster cheating or rationalization (working backward from a target solution)—quite the opposite of what is intended. Where science content and/or information-finding skills are the aim, PBL may tend toward close-ended problems. But it need not. In biology, in particular, problems might be reframed and answered at different organizational levels simultaneously. Close-ended problems may also be used to help develop problem-solving or analytical skills—but then one should carefully tailor assessment accordingly to promote and reward those skills, rather than just to yield “the right answer.” Finally, close-ended problems tend to support naive epistemological understanding of knowledge as stable, predetermined, and authority based (Schommer, 1990).\",\r\n        \"Open-ended problems, by contrast, tend to promote more creative skills and thus motivate a wider variety of students. Such types of problems also seem essential for developing an epistemological understanding that knowledge is both creative and empirical and that science, while evidence based, is contingent, sometimes underdetermined and provisional. Historical problems, ostensibly already solved, would seem to be close-ended, but they can be situated in their original context, in an open-ended framework in which process and reasoning is more important than any specific conclusion. As noted above, investigations framed in historical context become science in the making again. (Indeed, teachers may face the greater challenge, trying to temporarily blind themselves to known outcomes in order to focus on process alone.)\",\r\n        \"The cases that contextualize knowledge may be drawn from real-life examples, or they may be imaginatively assembled for an educational context. Constructed cases may be created to fit particular needs. They may be as simple or complex as one wants. They may be freely edited and streamlined to highlight core concepts or learning aims. One may readily generalize from them. On the other hand, constructed cases often carry an implicit aura of artificiality. They risk diminishing their motivational value if a student feels that they are contrived.\",\r\n        \"Real cases, by contrast, are indeed authentic, although they are often messy. Still, the messiness can be an asset. First, the unique constellation of particulars can help demonstrate the sometimes unexpected ways in which different factors in science interact (sources of funding, personality, happenstance, disparate facts, etc.). Second, they can help students learn how to negotiate in a complex world. How does one recognize and tease out the relevant variables? Third, they may also contribute to shaping another basic dimension of epistemological belief: The structure of knowledge can be complex, not always simple (Schommer, 1990).\",\r\n        \"At an impressive extreme, students—even nonscience majors or K–12 students—might participate in ongoing research. While tasks might not be any more demanding than gathering data, students may certainly understand the context of the work, see closely how it is structured, and take pride in contributing to developing original scientific knowledge (Crawford, 2012).\",\r\n        \"Only some problems in the world (perhaps quite few) are well defined. A complete education thus helps develop skills in articulating ill-defined problems (Jonassen, 1997). One may also help foster skills in posing problems (Jungck, 1985; Gonzales, 1998). However, problem-solving skills themselves may well be best developed when the problem is already well defined and students are appropriately motivated. Of course, a problem may be redefined or dissolved: that may be part of the solution (concluding that the problem was ill framed or ill conceived at the outset).\",\r\n        \"Ill-defined problems are typically a significant component in medical school problem-based education, reflecting the central role of diagnosis in clinical medicine—that is, of finding, characterizing, and identifying how or why the patient is not well. By contrast, cases used in business schools or law schools tend to be more well defined, reflecting the custom of addressing client-based criteria. In either case, refining or redefining a given problem—or even dissolving it entirely—may well enter the process en route to a solution, as found in scientific research as well.\",\r\n        \"A special category of PBL involves investigating rich data sets. These are already established measurements or results, but they are vast enough for exploration. Still, in an educational context, they have identifiable boundaries. Students may thus pose original problems that the data set may help answer. At the same time, one might entertain such enterprises mindfully. Some students may not share the instructor's or other students’ enthusiasm for investigation, even if they are given the freedom to frame their own question. Such students may thus become overwhelmed, discouraged, or even resentful. Opening problem-posing to students has risks (see also section on autonomy below).\",\r\n        \"Like other forms of education, CBL or PBL may be either individual, collaborative, or cooperative. For more on the benefits and limits of cooperative learning in general, see Johnson and Johnson (1991). In PBL and CBL, classroom practice becomes an implicit general model for how research or problem solving is done. Is knowledge generated individually or collectively?\",\r\n        \"Collaborative problem solving often involves special skills, such as brainstorming and supportive critique, which ideally become part of instruction. Collaboration should be further distinguished from cooperation, or group work, in which the product does not document or acknowledge the individual contributions of each group member (Panitz, 1996). That is, collaborative work maintains individual accountability. Each student may be responsible for a full product (case analysis, problem solution report, essay, exam, etc.) or for a discrete, identifiable portion of a final work product.\",\r\n        \"Collaboration may be exercised on several levels—in pairs, in small teams, or even in large groups. Some exercises, such as a model United Nations, model Congress, or simulated summit on climate change may include dozens or hundreds of students. Role-play simulations, especially, can allow for creative synthesis among many unique student contributors within the same class, and thus exhibit the power of collaborative engagement. To help illustrate the epistemic value of collaboration, fragments of information for solving a complex problem may well be artfully distributed among different roles.\",\r\n        \"While collaboration offers many potential benefits, working communally on a joint problem may be at odds with an individual pursuing a problem of personal relevance. Motivation (an alternative pedagogical aim) may suffer. Even if there is a consensus or a joint decision-making process, the shared problem may not engage all participants equally. Role-playing may be an effective pedagogical strategy for fostering a sense of personal responsibility through a vicarious as-if scenario.\",\r\n        \"Cases or problems are often addressed cogently from a single perspective, whether of a contemporary individual or a renowned historical scientist. Simple cases streamline the process of problem solving, which is perhaps appropriate for the initial stages of PBL learning. However, some cases are problematic, precisely because interpretations of the core problem differ. Here, a student learns, first, that problem solving or research may not be exclusively individual or univocal: That is, it does not unfold according to some universal linear algorithm (such as “the” scientific method). Multiple perspectives may also prove an asset. Other viewpoints may reveal alternative solutions not readily envisioned within a particular mind-set or background. One of the greatest benefits of any class discussion may be simply exposing students to other perspectives. This can deepen their awareness of alternatives. Students report that they thereby broaden their ways of thinking. They can learn merely from listening to how other students view the same facts differently.\",\r\n        \"Cases with multiple perspectives offer opportunities to teach about the social dimensions of developing knowledge and solving problems. Social epistemology, for example, has been highlighted recently by many philosophers of science (Longino, 1990; Goldman, 1999, 2002; Solomon, 2001), as well as by science educators (Osborne, 2010). When varying perspectives interact, one can enhance ways to analyze a problem or imagine its solution. Here, the instructional goal is to guide students in learning discursive skills, such as active listening, that contribute to such social-level analysis. Even criticism may have a positive role, exposing weak assumptions or increasing rigor of evidence. Tolerating criticism may an emotional or attitudinal skill, but it seems to have epistemic value. In yet other cases, in which interpretations conflict, students may learn skills in negotiating solutions or finding creative ways to accommodate apparently incompatible views (Fisher et al., 1991). Thus, CBL or PBL may adopt the familiar forms of a debate or role-play simulation (for well-developed complex examples, see Dunn et al. [2009] on Darwin and the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1862; Allchin [2009a] on Galileo's trial in 1633; Allchin [2009b] on a presidential commission on pesticides in 1963; and Montgomery [2010] on glacial geology in 1843). Designated roles provide students a concrete perspective for interpreting a case or problem, which can serve as additional grounding. Unfamiliar roles (or sides in a debate) can also enhance appreciation of alternative perspectives. Even when students continue to work primarily on their own, however, one may still find a fruitful learning role for an exchange of multiple perspectives.\",\r\n        \"The scope or magnitude of a case or problem itself may vary substantially, each with corresponding lessons. For brevity, consider three simple levels. First, vignettes or short stories focus on one relatively narrow question or problem. They can be easily inserted in a lecture format, say. But they are also limited. They convey that science and problem solving is easy and reductionistic. Second, lessons might extend over a full class period, as one activity or a series of short, related problems. Finally, one may use major projects that extend over several class periods, weeks, or the bulk of a semester if the complexity of the problem allows. For examples of the latter, see White (1992) on hemoglobin in biochemistry, Tewksbury (1999) on geology and the Aswan Dam, or Klassen (2006) on electrodynamics and the transatlantic cable. To the degree that science is complex and that education implicitly frames expectations beyond the classroom, teachers may well be encouraged to include some complex case studies or problems at some point in their courses as an indication of the real world and as an occasion for developing interpretive and organizational skills appropriate to such situations. One may also structure a series of lessons through a lineage of problems—as is frequently already done in teaching transmission genetics, atomic models, or the wave/particle nature of light (for example, the biology text by Mix et al. [1996] is organized on this principle).\",\r\n        \"Scaling problems appropriately also has an important affective dimension, relevant to students’ long-term motivational context. In introducing PBL, especially, one might aim initially to create successful experiences, to promote positive attitudes toward further work (or at least averting a sense of failure that discourages future effort!). Coping with perceived failure as an outcome—or as a potential opportunity for learning—may itself be a goal but may well be reserved for more advanced levels.\",\r\n        \"Student selection of the problem may contribute to the sense of ownership that makes the learning personal. But it need not. Some problems may be justified as of general interest or in a framework of public responsibility.\",\r\n        \"One caution here is that, while the student may choose the problem, he or she generally does not have the option of not choosing a problem (say, because there is nothing of intrinsic interest). Here, the goal of using context as a motivator is lost.\",\r\n        \"Does the teacher ever answer a question with anything other than another question? Depending on the local aims, the teacher may provide plentiful background information, including standard lectures. Alternatively, the student may be responsible for finding all such information (perhaps with guidance at the level of how to find that information). Or some intermediate form of support may be suitable to the aims and occasion at hand. The respective student challenges should not be overlooked.\",\r\n        \"Problem-solving activities may be teacher-guided or student-directed. Guided work may be more important than earlier imagined (Mayer, 2004; Minstrell and Kraus, 2005), at least initially. Again, one responsibility for the instructor is to be familiar with (or pre-assess) student abilities and to frame problems at an achievable level. Even when students have autonomy, the teacher has a critical role as advisor and coach and possibly as a resource guide.\",\r\n        \"When problem solving is collaborative, an important role is facilitating discussion. Teachers may adopt this role initially, again to model appropriate skills or to monitor and adjust progress along the way. Alternatively, students may be encouraged to develop such skills, sometimes in small groups, in an explicitly designated role.\",\r\n        \"An important dimension of collaborative work is developing consensus when interpretations differ, especially by appeal to evidence and reasoning, rather than external authority (the instructor, say, or the textbook). Persuasion, argumentation, active listening, revising, and accommodating conflict creatively are among the skills to be addressed in a complete problem-solving education (Fisher et al., 1991; Osborne, 2010).\",\r\n        \"Instructional strategies labeled as PBL and CBL embrace a wide range of intersecting but independent values. While some advocates may try to enforce strict definitions or “best practices,” an informed instructor should understand the various alternatives and be mindful of the differential outcomes (Table 1).\",\r\n        \"Many educators construe CBL and PBL merely as methods. They imply that an instructor need only learn how to use the method, without understanding or endorsing the values or objectives embodied in certain aspects of the teaching style. The misaligned objectives and teaching style can confound students and, ironically, tarnish teaching quality. The discussion of the values and outcomes above can help inform effective choices and instructional design.\",\r\n        \"Also, while noting a key role for motivation, many educators tend to profile PBL and CBL narrowly in cognitive terms. They sometimes overlook potential affective outcomes that shape, among other things, a learner's investment in learning and a respectful and fruitful teacher–student relationship. Also, while parading the virtues of critical thinking or higher-order thinking skills, introductory presentations may disregard the implicit epistemic or nature-of-science lessons. For example, problem cases that apply knowledge may convey content well, but simultaneously present science as a reservoir of pre-established knowledge. They may eclipse epistemic understanding about how science generates new knowledge. Indeed, every science lesson indirectly conveys a message about scientific practices and the nature of scientific knowledge. The effective instructor mindfully manages these lessons, aware of potentially unintended outcomes.\",\r\n        \"Finally, much educational research to date on the efficacy of PBL has been multivariate and failed to differentiate the roles of the individual dimensions noted above. What is the relationship between particular dimensions of teaching and particular outcomes for learners (e.g., motivation, attitudes toward the subject, autonomy in problem solving, problem-solving biases, nature-of-science understanding, and epistemological lessons), and when do they overlap? Ideally, research on CBL or PBL will focus on articulating the relevant variables and their corresponding effects.\",\r\n        \"Most important, it may be prudent to acknowledge that the family of PBL and CBL strategies are not a panacea for any deficit in science education. They are tools. When used appropriately, a tool can be useful. But the specific tool depends on particular contexts and values. Even lecturing may, on occasion, have an indispensable role (say, in conveying the overall structure and organization of a field's knowledge).\",\r\n        \"Acknowledging the limitations of CBL and PBL, however, one may also underscore the opportunities they offer. For example, one can hardly learn problem-solving skills without engaging problems. Posing problems for students to solve thus seems a central tool for much analytical and creative skill development. Likewise, participation in knowledge-generating cases, whether direct or vicarious, seems integral to learning or appreciating the nature of scientific research. Similarly, historical cases seem important to learning certain core nature-of-science themes. Finally, to develop more sophisticated epistemological perspectives, students should be exposed to complex cases (complex structure of knowledge), historical cases (conceptual change), knowledge-generating cases (empiricism as a source of authority), and successful experience in problem solving (active role of the knower; Schommer, 1990). Such views are, ultimately, foundational to continued and autonomous learning—namely, learning how to learn.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,0\":

\"In December 2019, an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia in Wuhan [1] was caused by a new coronavirus infection named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019). Noncontrast chest CT may be considered for early diagnosis of viral disease, although viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the standard of reference. Chung et al. reported that chest CT may be negative for viral pneumonia of COVID-19 [2] at initial presentation (3/21 patients). Recently, Xie reported 5/167 (3%) patients who had negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 at initial presentation despite chest CT findings typical of viral pneumonia [3]. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of chest CT and viral nucleic acid assay at initial patient presentation.\",\r\n        \"The retrospective analysis was approved by institutional review board and patient consent was waived. Patients at Taizhou Enze Medical Center (Group) Enze Hospital were evaluated from January 19, 2020 to February 4, 2020. During this period, chest CT and RT-PCR (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) was performed for consecutive patients who presented with a history of 1) travel or residential history in Wuhan or local endemic areas or contact with individuals with individuals with fever or respiratory symptoms from these areas within 14 days and 2) had fever or acute respiratory symptoms of unknown cause. In the case of an initial negative RT-PCR test, repeat testing was performed at intervals of 1 day or more. Of these patients, we included all patients who had both noncontrast chest CT scan (slice thickness, 5mm) and RT-PCR testing within an interval of 3 days or less and who had an eventual confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR testing (Figure 1). Typical and atypical chest CT findings were recorded according to CT features previously described for COVD-19 (4,5). The detection rate of COVID-19 infection based on the initial chest CT and RT-PCR was compared. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar Chi-squared test with significance at the p <.05 level.\",\r\n        \"51 patients (29 men and 22 women) were included with median age of 45 (interquartile range, 39- 55) years. All patients had throat swab (45 patients) or sputum samples (6 patients) followed by one or more RT-PCR assays. The average time from initial disease onset to CT was 3 +/- 3 days; the average time from initial disease onset to RT-PCR testing was 3 +/- 3 days. 36/51 patients had initial positive RT-PCR for COVID-19. 12/51 patients had COVID-19 confirmed by two RT-PCR nucleic acid tests (1 to 2 days), 2 patients by three tests (2-5 days) and 1 patient by four tests (7 days) after initial onset.\",\r\n        \"50/51 (98%) patients had evidence of abnormal CT compatible with viral pneumonia at baseline while one patient had a normal CT. Of 50 patients with abnormal CT, 36 (72%) had typical CT manifestations (e.g. peripheral, subpleural ground glass opacities, often in the lower lobes (Figure 2) and 14 (28%) had atypical CT manifestations (Figure 3) [2]. In this patient sample, difference in detection rate for initial CT (50/51 [98%, 95% CI 90-100%]) patients was greater than first RT-PCR (36/51 [71%, 95%CI 56-83%]) patients (p<.001).\",\r\n        \"In our series, the sensitivity of chest CT was greater than that of RT-PCR (98% vs 71%, respectively, p<.001). The reasons for the low efficiency of viral nucleic acid detection may include: 1) immature development of nucleic acid detection technology; 2) variation in detection rate from different manufacturers; 3) low patient viral load; or 4) improper clinical sampling. The reasons for the relatively lower RT-PCR detection rate in our sample compared to a prior report are unknown (3). Our results support the use of chest CT for screening for COVD-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features compatible with COVID-19 infection particularly when RT-PCR testing is negative.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,6\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,7\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,9\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,10\":

(C16:0) is a long-chain saturated fatty acid, and a component of various lipids playing important roles in cell membrane organization, signal transduction, and energy storage. Moreover, the palmitoyl chain can be attached to proteins in a process called palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation), which modification affects their localization and functioning.\",\r\n        \"In the human body palmitic acid is synthetized in a process called de novo lipogenesis. It takes place mainly in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and cells of lactating mammary glands (1). Palmitic acid is used for the synthesis of phospholipids and sphingolipids, may undergo elongation and/or desaturation into other fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid or oleic acid, respectively), and can be esterified to form storage lipids—triacylglycerols. Apart from de novo synthesis, palmitic acid is also provided to the human body with food. Since palmitic acid is universally found in natural fats, its consumption exceeds the consumption of other saturated fatty acids and, in the USA it accounts for about 60% of the total intake of saturated fatty acids (2). A growing body of experimental and clinical evidence points to a link between a westernized diet, including a high intake of saturated fatty acids, and chronic inflammatory diseases (3–5). As dietary saturated and unsaturated fatty acids apparently modulate activity of immune cells, their influence on the immune responses triggered upon infection is also beginning to be investigated (6). These facts drive the interest in palmitic acid with an aim of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of its immunomodulatory properties.\",\r\n        \"In this review, we focus on S-palmitoylation of proteins crucial for the interactions of pathogenic bacteria and viruses with the host. We emphasize novel data on the role of S-palmitoylated proteins in the invasion of host cells by pathogens and those involved in the host innate immune responses to the infection, which have been obtained thanks to the application of new technical approaches. Recently, substantial progress in the understanding of protein palmitoylation was made possible by the development of methods allowing high-throughput analysis of cellular/tissue palmitoyl proteomes. We begin, however, by showing how unique protein S-palmitoylation is among other protein lipidations.\",\r\n        \"S-palmitoylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins consisting in a potentially reversible covalent attachment of palmitoyl chain to a cysteine residue(s) of proteins through a thioester bond (Table 1). Thus, S-palmitoylation resembles other reversible regulatory posttranslational protein modifications, including phosphorylation or acetylation, well-established factors affecting protein structure and functions. In particular, S-palmitoylation modifies cellular localization of proteins and their stability. The most dramatic changes of localization concern cytosolic proteins which upon S-palmitoylation acquire a hydrophobic anchor facilitating their docking into membranes (Figure 1). However, several integral membrane proteins also undergo S-palmitoylation. It often occurs on cysteine residue(s) located in the proximity of the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the protein. S-palmitoylated transmembrane proteins occupy various cellular compartments, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane. In accordance, for some proteins, such as transmembrane adaptor proteins in leukocytes, S-palmitoylation was found secondary to the length and hydrophobicity of the transmembrane domain as a determinant of plasma membrane destination (7).\",\r\n        \"S-palmitoylation also contributes to the compartmentalization of proteins to distinct domains of membranes—rafts and tetraspanin-rich microdomains. In fact, the interest in S-palmitoylation was boosted when it was found to be required for the targeting of some signaling proteins to rafts. Rafts are nanodomains of the plasma membrane and some intracellular membranes, mainly of the trans-Golgi apparatus, rich in sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids with saturated fatty acid chains, and cholesterol (32). The plasma membrane nanodomains are sites of signal transduction by distinct receptors of immune cells involved in both acquired immune reactions, such as T cell receptor (TCR), Fcε receptor I, Fcγ receptor II, and in innate immune responses, such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (33, 34). Rafts are also sites of virion assembly and budding, as established, e.g., for influenza A virus and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (35, 36). Peripheral membrane proteins acylated with saturated fatty acids are likely to anchor preferentially between the ordered saturated lipids of rafts rather than between the disordered lipids of the surrounding membrane. It has been shown that, owing to their raft localization, S-palmitoylated kinases of the Src family interact with raft-associating plasma membrane immunoreceptors and initiate signaling cascades fundamental to acquired immunity (15, 37, 38). It is worth noting that also the acyl chains attached to proteins can affect the membrane structure. Studies on model membranes have revealed that palmitic and myristic acids facilitate formation of ordered lamellar membrane regions (39, 40). In accordance, S-palmitoylation of erythrocyte peripheral membrane protein called membrane-palmitoylated protein 1 (MPP1) was found to be required for the proper lateral organization and fluidity of erythrocyte membrane. In the absence of MPP1 S-palmitoylation, raft assembly was disturbed and erythrocyte functioning compromised leading to hemolytic anemia in patients deficient in the enzyme catalyzing this reaction (41, 42). Preferential raft association is a feature of some S-palmitoylated transmembrane proteins, e.g., adaptor proteins PAG, LAT, and NTAL, which collaborate with the abovementioned immunoreceptors. In fact, palmitoylation is required for the raft association of most integral raft proteins (8, 43, 44).\",\r\n        \"On the other hand, S-palmitoylation does not obligatorily confer raft localization on transmembrane proteins. Certain S-palmitoylated proteins, such as transferrin receptor, glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and anthrax toxin receptor, tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), are actually excluded from rafts. Apparently, a combination of S-palmitoylation and the properties of the transmembrane domain of the protein contribute to its destination to the raft or non-raft environment (43, 45). It has also been proposed that the attachment of a fatty acyl chain at the juxtamembrane cysteine(s) of a protein can induce tilting of its transmembrane fragment, determining in which part of the membrane it will accommodate to avoid a hydrophobic mismatch potentially caused by the thickness of the bilayer (46).\",\r\n        \"That not all S-palmitoylated proteins associate with rafts has been shown convincingly for macrophage-like RAW264 cells, where only about half of those proteins were found in the Triton X-100-resistant membrane fraction enriched in rafts (47, 48). In accordance, proteomic data on the distribution of S-palmitoylated proteins in prostate cancer cells have revealed that several such proteins are recovered in the non-raft (Triton X-100-soluble) fraction and are likely localized to microdomains enriched in scaffold proteins called tetraspanins (49). The tetraspanins are small integral membrane proteins found in the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes, having four transmembrane helices and undergoing S-palmitoylation at several conserved cysteine residues. The tetraspanins interact with each other and with various transmembrane and cytosolic partners, often also S-palmitoylated, forming microdomains (“tetraspanin web”) (50). It has been suggested that the amino acid composition of the S-palmitoylation site in some transmembrane proteins, such as the adaptor proteins involved in acquired immune responses, determines the association of those S-palmitoylated proteins with rafts or with the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (44). An intriguing and still poorly addressed question concerns the relation between rafts and the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, apparently of functional significance, e.g., during virus budding from host cells (35). This uncertainty stems partially from the fact that S-palmitoylation of tetraspanins governs their interactions with cholesterol and gangliosides leading at certain conditions to the recovery of tetraspanins in detergent-resistant membrane fractions enriched in rafts (51, 52). Besides its involvement in targeting proteins to rafts or tetraspanin-enriched microdomain, S-palmitoylation has been found to govern accumulation of the transmembrane chaperone protein calnexin in the perinuclear domain of endoplasmic reticulum (53).\",\r\n        \"S-palmitoylation also affects protein stability through its interplay with ubiquitination or phosphorylation, as found for the anthrax toxin receptor TEM8, antiviral interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM1, calnexin, and zDHHC6, one of palmitoyl acyltransferases described below (54–57).\",\r\n        \"Possibly the most intriguing is the reversible character of S-palmitoylation. Enzymes catalyzing palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of proteins have been characterized (58, 59). Palmitate is transferred onto the thiol group of cysteine from cytosolic palmitoyl-CoA by palmitoyl acyltransferases, enzymes containing the zinc finger DHHC domain named after the highly conserved Asp–His–His–Cys peptide (Figure 1). This is a two-step reaction comprising transient autoacylation of zDHHC enzymes and transfer of the fatty acyl chain from this intermediate to a protein substrate (60). In mammals, the zDHHC enzyme family consists of 24 proteins, and zDHHC proteins are also found in other eukaryotes but not in bacteria nor are they encoded by viral genomes. Mammalian zDHHC enzymes, each having at least four transmembrane helices, are located in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus (58). They display some specificity toward their protein substrates and also selectivity toward fatty acyl moieties other than palmitate, which contributes to the heterogeneity of lipids attached to proteins, such as viral glycoproteins described below (61). In the opposite process, the thioester bond is cleaved by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) (APT1 and APT2) and palmitoyl protein thioesterases (PPTs) (PPT1 and PPT2), which are localized in the cytosol and in lysosomes, respectively. APT1 and APT2 likely govern the dynamic functional changes of S-acylation of proteins (62) while PPT1 and PPT2 depalmitoylate proteins during their degradation (63, 64). Recently, serine hydrolases of the ABHD17 family have also been identified as depalmitoylating enzymes, and their specific substrate proteins determined (65, 66). Of note, the zDHHCs, APT1/APT2, and ABHD17 proteins are S-palmitoylated themselves, and palmitoylation of zDHHCs and depalmitoylation of APT1/2 can occur in a cascade manner (57, 62).\",\r\n        \"The dynamic cycles of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation detected for several peripheral membrane proteins are often synchronized with intracellular trafficking of those proteins. They circulate between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus or endosomes, as exemplified by N- and H-Ras, R7-regulator of G protein and APTs. In fact, it is proposed that palmitoylation-dependent anchoring of APT1 in the plasma membrane allows it to depalmitoylate H-Ras at this location, while subsequent auto-depalmitoylation releases APT1 guiding it, alongside H-Ras, for another round of palmitoylation at the Golgi apparatus (62, 67–69). Cycles of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation are crucial for signaling by distinct plasma membrane receptors and for their distribution (69–71). Activation of TCR receptor or Fas receptor in T cells was found to trigger quick and transient palmitoylation of Lck kinase of the Src family (72, 73), but the exact meaning of the dynamic protein S-palmitoylation for processes triggered during the host–pathogen interaction awaits elucidation.\",\r\n        \"It is worth mentioning that although the zDDHC enzymes catalyze bulk protein palmitoylation in eukaryotic cells (74), some proteins have a unique autopalmitoylation activity. These include Bet3, a component of a multisubunit transport protein particle complex involved in vesicular trafficking, TEA domain transcription factors, and also bacterial Evf protein (75–78). The palmitic acid residue is attached constitutively to a specific cysteine residue of those proteins, remains buried inside a hydrophobic pocked in their core thereby affecting the tertiary structure and, thus, interactions with other proteins (75, 77). An exhaustive discussion on the physiology of S-palmitoylated proteins in eukaryotic cells can be found in several recent reviews (46, 79, 80).\",\r\n        \"It has been established that, in addition to palmitate, various other fatty acyl moieties, such as saturated stearate (C18:0) or monounsaturated palmitoleate (C16:1), and oleate (C18:1) can be attached via the thioester linkage to proteins. The early reports on the heterogeneity of the fatty acyl moieties attached to cysteines obtained by analysis of selected immunoprecipitated proteins (15, 16, 81–83) have recently been complemented by a comprehensive proteomic analysis of fatty-acylated proteins of macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14). The latter study showed that an enrichment of culture medium of cells with monounsaturated fatty acids leads to their incorporation into a similar set of proteins as those normally modified with palmitate. Among them, several proteins relevant to innate immune responses were found. All these data justify the use of a broader term S-acylation rather than S-palmitoylation (Table 1). The physiological consequences of S-acylation of proteins with individual fatty acids are slowly being revealed. Modification of Fyn kinase with polyunsaturated fatty acid residue, such as arachidonate (C20:4), disturbed its raft localization and, thereby, TCR signaling (15). A heterogeneity of S-acylation was also found in viral spike proteins, such as hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus, and E1 and E2 of Semliki Forest virus, which are modified in host eukaryotic cells by attachment of both palmitate and stearate (9). In HA, stearate is attached at the transmembrane cysteine while palmitate is attached to two cysteine residues in a membrane-proximal region of the protein. The stearoyl chain seems to accommodate into a groove formed by amino acids of the transmembrane helix shaping the domain in a way that facilitates its fitting into rafts (84). S-stearoylation of human transferrin receptor 1 at the juxtamembrane cysteine residues(s) is a key factor of the signaling cascade controlling mitochondrial morphology and functioning (13). Of interest, the latter study also showed that dietary supplementation of stearic acid reversed the deleterious effects of a genetically determined mitochondria dysfunction in Drosophila. Taking into account that unsaturated fatty acids affect the profile of S-acylation of proteins in vitro (14, 15), it is of outmost interest whether a similar effect of unsaturated and saturated (palmitic) fatty acids could be achieved in vivo with respect to proteins of immune cells.\",\r\n        \"Beside S-acylation, less frequently palmitate can also be attached to the amine group of various amino acids (glycine, cysteine, and lysine) giving N-palmitoylation or to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine in a process called O-palmitoylation (Table 1). As during S-palmitoylation, also other fatty acids can be utilized in these processes named then N- and O-acylation. Thus, a type of protein N-acylation is N-myristoylation, a frequent modification contributing to membrane anchoring of peripheral proteins. The saturated myristate (C14:0) is transferred to the protein from myristoyl-CoA by N-myristoyl transferase (two isozymes in mammals). In a vast majority of cases, myristate is attached co-translationally to the N-terminal glycine residue (after removal of the initiator methionine) via an amide linkage (Table 1). Like most lipidations, this modification is irreversible. Several viral proteins are N-myristoylated, such as Gag of HIV-1 crucial for budding of newly formed virions from plasma membrane rafts of host cells, and proteins of parasitic protozoa Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania donovani (causing malaria, African sleeping sickness, and leishmaniosis, respectively). For this reason, N-myristoyl transferase is considered a potential drug target in the therapy of these diseases (17–19, 85, 86).\",\r\n        \"Data on the N- and O-palmitoylation of proteins involved in the host–pathogen interactions are limited, but interesting conclusions can be drawn from the information concerning proteins taking part in other processes. N-palmitoylation of the N-terminal glycine of the α-subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (Gαs) has been described (20) (Table 1) besides the well-known S-palmitoylation of this pivotal signaling protein. The N-palmitoylation of Gαs is irreversible, and the enzyme responsible for this modification is unknown. It has been speculated that S- to N-palmitoyl migration can occur both in vivo and also in vitro during mass spectrometry analysis (20, 87). This suggests that caution is needed in interpreting results of this methodological approach, which is used with increasing frequency to study fatty acylation of proteins in immune cells (see next sections). Probably the best-characterized is the N-palmitoylation of the N-terminal cysteine residue of hedgehog proteins (sonic, Indian, and desert in mammals). It determines secretion of these proteins, which regulate embryonic patterning (Table 1). Secreted Wnt and ghrelin proteins are examples of O-acylation of serine residues with unusual fatty acid residues such as palmitoleate (C16:1) and octaonoate (C8:0) (Table 1). The fatty acylation of hedgehog, Wnt, and ghrelin is catalyzed by enzymes from the multipass membrane-bound O-acyl transferases family (31). Besides these unusual fatty acid residues, attachment of palmitate to serine and threonine residues is found in secreted venom toxins of the spider Plectreurys tristis, which selectively target neuronal ion channels (88). Also histone H4 is O-palmitoylated at a serine residue in the nucleus by acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (25) (Table 1). The latter is of special interest in the context of innate immune responses since histone H4 O-palmitoylation regulates transcriptional activity, which is the final outcome of the pro-inflammatory signaling pathways triggered by receptors of the innate immune system.\",\r\n        \"Special attention should be devoted to ε-N-acylation consisting in the attachment of a fatty acid residue to the side chain of lysine by amide linkage (Table 1). ε-N-myristoylated are interleukin 1α (IL-1α) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), the pro-inflammatory cytokines crucial in combating bacterial infections (22). The enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction is unknown, but it has been established that sirtuins reverse this modification (89). The ε-N-acylation affects the release of TNFα by immune cells (90, 91). Surprisingly, this rare modification is also found in toxins of so-called RTX (repeats-in-toxin) class released by some pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria (23, 24). We describe these cases in more detail in the following sections.\",\r\n        \"Besides S-palmitoylation and N-myristoylation, S-prenylation is another common lipidation that endows proteins with a hydrophobic moiety and contributes to their association with membranes. This modification relies on the posttranslational and irreversible attachment of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl chains to a cysteine residue in the C-terminal CAAX box (alternatively also CC and CXC motifs) via a thioether linkage. The process is catalyzed by protein prenyl transferases that use polyprenylpyrophosphate as the donor of the isoprenoid group (Table 1). In peripheral membrane proteins, the S-palmitoylation site is often located in proximity of N-myristoylation or S-prenylation sites or a polybasic motif, which all are likely to mediate initial weak binding of a protein to a membrane and thereby facilitate subsequent attachment of palmitate to the protein by the integral membrane zDHHC enzymes (31). In contrast to S-palmitoylation, data on the role of S-prenylation of proteins key to the host–pathogen interactions are scarce (92). However, since S-prenylation is typical for the ubiquitous small GTPases of Ras superfamily, it is vital for proper functioning of B and T cells (93, 94).\",\r\n        \"A glance at Table 1 indicates that palmitate can be covalently bound via oxyester, amide, and thioester linkages to respective amino acid residues creating an array of possible modifications. O- and N-palmitoylation of proteins seems to be stable, resembling in this regard the other common protein lipidations, N-myristoylation and S-prenylation. By contrast, there exist enzymes cleaving the thioester bond formed during S-palmitoylation. For a long time, our understanding of protein S-palmitoylation and its dynamics was poor in comparison with other reversible protein modifications due to technical difficulties. Only recently have these difficulties been overcome with the introduction of methods allowing high-throughput identification of palmitoylated proteins, also those involved in the immune response to microbial pathogens, as discussed in the next sections.\",\r\n        \"In the click chemistry-based method, cells are metabolically labeled with a palmitic acid analog bearing an alkyne group at the ω carbon of the fatty acyl chain, such as 17-octadecynoic acid (17ODYA) or alk-16 (Figure 2A), and this step resembles the classic labeling of cells with [3H]-palmitic acid. However, in the click chemistry-based assay, the labeling and lysis of cells is followed by in vitro coupling of the function group of the palmitic acid analog to a reporter tag, which greatly enhances the sensitivity of detection of labeled proteins (98, 99). Thus, after cell lysis, the labeled proteins are subjected to Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition known as “click” reaction with an azide-bearing detection tag. In this step, a triazol is formed between the alkyne group in the palmitic acid analog and the azide of the tag (Figure 2A). The azide-bearing tags can be either fluorescent, such as tetramethylrhodamine or dyes with infrared fluorescence, or carry a biotin moiety. Depending on the tag used, subsequent SDS-PAGE separation of proteins allows global visualization of palmitoylated proteins by simple in-gel fluorescence or by blotting with a streptavidin-conjugated reporter (98, 101, 102). Notably, proteins biotinylated via the click reaction can also be enriched on streptavidin-coated beads and then subjected to on-bead tryptic digestion (or in-gel digestion if eluted from the beads) followed by identification by mass spectrometry. Such comprehensive click chemistry-based proteomic analysis has brought about identification of an array of palmitoylated proteins in dendritic cells (10, 103), macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14), and T cells (99, 104, 105). Some of the S-palmitoylated proteins newly identified in those studies, such as IFITM3 and TLR2, are involved in the host–pathogen interactions regulating innate immune responses (10, 103), while many others are known to contribute to adaptive immunity (99, 105), as described below. Recently, global profiling of Toxoplasma gondii (the causative agent of toxoplasmosis) has been performed revealing that many components of the parasite’s motility complex are palmitoylated (106). Similar studies on Cryptococcus neoformans (the fungus causing cryptococcal meningitis) have revealed a contribution of specific zDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase, called Pfa4, to its virulence (107). Moreover, application of analogs of various saturated and unsaturated fatty acids confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the fatty acylation of proteins in RAW264 cells and suggested that dietary unsaturated fatty acids, after incorporation to proteins, can change their properties and thereby affect the functioning of immune cells (14).\",\r\n        \"The major advantage of the click chemistry-based method is that it can reveal the time course of protein S-palmitoylation. By using click chemistry-based labeling in the pulse-chase mode, one can follow the dynamics of protein palmitoylation. With such an approach, it was found that the palmitate turnover on Lck, an Src-family tyrosine kinase, is accelerated by T cell activation (72). Additional introduction of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cells (SILAC) has provided quantitative proteomic data on the dynamics of protein palmitoylation in the cell (104, 110). This approach revealed, rather unexpectedly, that in unstimulated T cell hybridoma, the palmitoylation of most protein species does not undergo turnover (104). Another advantage of the click chemistry-based assay is its high specificity, because the alkyne group introduced in the analog of palmitic acid is not normally found in cells (98, 102). The click chemistry-based methods can also be used to follow the cellular localization of palmitoylated proteins by immunofluorescence when combined with the proximity ligation technique (111, 112). Palmitoylation of individual proteins can also be studied after their immunoprecipitation (11, 72, 73, 98).\",\r\n        \"Despite its unquestionable success, the click chemistry-based methods have limitations. They will detect only those proteins that undergo palmitoylation during the period of the metabolic labeling of cells. One should also bear in mind that the palmitic acid analog can be incorporated at S-, N-, and O-palmitoylation sites alike (111, 112). In addition, although 17ODYA (alk-16) is preferentially used to mimic palmitoylation of proteins, it can also be incorporated with low efficiency at N-myristoylation sites of proteins (98, 99). Another group of proteins that will be labeled with the palmitic acid analog but are not S-palmitoylated are those bearing the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (85, 113). Most of these limitations can be overcome using various fatty acid reporters, inhibitors, and by exploiting the sensitivity of the thioester bond to hydroxylamine treatment. Given the large variety of chemical reporters preferentially mimicking distinct fatty acids, recent years have witnessed a plethora of chemistry-based proteomic studies not only on palmitoylated but also myristoylated proteins and proteins bearing the GPI anchor, including those of pathogens and immune cells (10, 14, 85, 86, 114).\",\r\n        \"The ABE method can be used as a complement to the click chemistry-based approach in cell studies but unlike the latter it is uniquely suitable for studying whole tissues. ABE does not require metabolic labeling of proteins in living cells, thus some of the abovementioned limitations and difficulties do not apply. The ABE method relies on in vitro exchange of thioester-linked palmitate to a derivative of biotin which allows subsequent affinity purification of the resulting biotin-labeled proteins on streptavidin-coated beads (Figure 2B). The first step of the ABE involves lysis of cells or tissues followed by irreversible blockage of free thiol groups in the solubilized proteins by alkylation, most often with N-ethylmaleimide. Subsequently, the thioester bonds existing in S-palmitoylated proteins are broken with hydroxylamine, releasing palmitoyl moieties. The newly exposed thiol groups can now be tagged with sulfhydryl-reactive derivatives, such as biotin-HPDP, forming disulfide bonds with thiols. The biotinylated proteins are subsequently captured on streptavidin-coated beads and eluted with agents that reduce the disulfide bond between the protein and biotin-HPDP, such as β-mercapthoethanol, DTT, or TCEP (49, 74, 115, 116). As an alternative to biotinylation, in the so-called acyl-RAC technique, the newly exposed protein thiol groups in hydroxylamine-treated cell lysates are captured on a resin containing sulfhydryl-reactive groups (117). In both ABE and acyl-RAC, the eluted proteins can be separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by gel staining or immunoblotting, or identified by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, when the hydroxylamine-released palmitoyl moieties are exchanged for a polyethylene glycol-maleimide derivative of a distinct molecular weight, a shift in-gel migration of tagged proteins is observed reflecting the number of fatty acyl residues originally S-bound to the protein (118, 119).\",\r\n        \"The ABE method has so far been used successfully for proteomic profiling of S-acylated proteins in immune cells, such as RAW264 cells (48), several types of blood cells, such as platelets, primary T cells, and immortalized B cells (120–122), pathogenic microorganisms such as T. brucei and T. gondii (123, 124), and tissues (125, 126). To quantify the aberrations in protein palmitoylation in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease, whole animal stable isotope labeling of mammals (SILAM) was applied followed by tissue isolation and ABE procedure (127). In another approach, for quantitative analysis of the T-cell palmitoylome, ABE was combined with labeling of proteins with various oxygen isotopes during their digestion with trypsin before mass spectrometry analysis (122). In addition, preselection of tryptic peptides obtained by ABE on streptavidin-coated or sulfhydryl-reactive resins greatly facilitates the identification of S-acylation sites by mass spectrometry (49, 110, 117).\",\r\n        \"Some aspects of the ABE method deserve a comment. Since the assay relies on the sensitivity of thioester bonds to hydroxylamine, ABE detects all S-acylation without distinguishing between S-palmitoylation and the other cases. Furthermore, there is a possibility of false-positive detection of proteins bearing a thioester linkage with compounds other than fatty acyl residues, such as ubiquitin in the E2 ubiquitin conjugase Ubc1 (115). Another source of false-positives is proteins in which free thiol groups were not completely alkylated before biotinylation. On the other hand, insufficient deacylation of bonafide fatty-acylated proteins with hydroxylamine results in their absence in the final sample (116).\",\r\n        \"In summary, the click chemistry-based method relies on metabolic labeling of cells with a palmitic acid analog which incorporates into proteins and next tagging it with reporter molecules greatly enhancing the sensitivity of detection. It only reveals proteins undergoing S-palmitoylation during metabolic labeling of cells and allows revealing turnover of this modification. By contrast, the ABE method is based on direct binding of sulfhydryl-reactive derivatives to thiol groups of cysteines unraveled by hydroxylamine treatment after lysis of cells or tissues. It allows the investigation of the whole but static palmitoylome. A comparative proteomic study of protein palmitoylation in P. falciparum found that the sets of proteins identified using these two approaches overlapped in 57.2% (113), indicating that they provide complementary data on the cellular palmitoyl proteome. Thanks to the application of the click chemistry- and ABE-based methods numerous new palmitoylated proteins have been identified. In 2015, a SwissPalm database was launched, (128) which provides an excellent, manually curated resource of information on palmitoylated proteins, palmitoylation sites, etc., available at http://swisspalm.epfl.ch/. All these efforts have greatly furthered our knowledge on molecular mechanisms regulating diverse aspects of cell functioning, including host–pathogen interactions and progress of infectious diseases, as highlighted below.\",\r\n        \"Bacteria lack protein palmitoyl acyltransferases of the zDHHC family and, therefore, are essentially devoid of S-palmitoylated proteins. Yet, they have developed unique mechanisms utilizing fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to modify their glycolipids and proteins. These modifications augment infectivity and help bacteria evade recognition by the host innate immune system. For example, the vast majority of Gram-negative bacteria produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a part of their outer membrane. LPS is composed of the variable polysaccharide O-antigen and more-conserved lipid A containing two glucosamine residues hexa-acylated with hydroxymyristic, myristic, and lauric acid. Lipid A is recognized by CD14 protein and TLR4 receptor complexed with MD2 protein on the plasma membrane of the host immune and some non-immune cells. Activation of TLR4 triggers strong pro-inflammatory reactions aiming at eradication of the bacteria, but when exaggerated, eventually leading to sepsis (129). Incorporation of an additional palmitoyl chain into lipid A markedly diminishes its ability to activate TLR4 and to induce the host pro-inflammatory responses, which is correlated with an increased survival of bacteria forming a biofilm (130, 131). This strategy is utilized among others by Salmonella typhimurium, a causative agent of gastroenteritis, by Bordetella bronchiseptica, a respiratory pathogen of human and other mammals, and by Yersinia pestis causing plague (132, 133). The formation of the extra-acylated LPS relies on the transfer of palmitate from phospholipids onto the hydroxymyristate chain at position 2 of glucosamine of lipid A. The reaction is catalyzed by lipid A palmitoyltransferases (PagP in Salmonella and its homologs in other bacteria) localized in the outer membrane of these pathogens (134, 135). In addition to causing steric hindrance preventing the binding to the TLR4/MD2 complex, the hepta-acylation of LPS also protects bacteria from the lytic activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides, most likely by reducing the fluidity of the bacterial outer membrane (136, 137).\",\r\n        \"Apart from being incorporated into LPS in diverse bacteria, palmitate has also been found to modify a virulence factor of Gram-negative Erwinia carotovora, the Evf protein. The palmitoyl chain is linked via a thioester bond to the Cys209 residue at the center of Evf, plausibly by a self-palmitoylating activity of the protein. E. carotovora is a phytopatogen using insects such as Drosophila as vectors for dissemination between plants. The palmitoylation of Evf is required for infectivity of E. carotovora and its persistence in the insect gut, however, its mode of action of unknown. It has been speculated to be linked with an ability of Evf to associate with lipid bilayers, but the lack of similarities between Evf and any other bacterial protein of known function makes prediction on this subject difficult (79).\",\r\n        \"A number of bacterial toxins of so-called RTX class released during infection of mammals by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria undergo ε-N-acylation of the side chain of internal lysines. These toxins include adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis, acylated with palmitic acid, and α-hemolysin of extraintestinal (uropathogenic) Escherichia coli, acylated with myristic acid and also 15- and 17-carbon fatty acids. The acylation is catalyzed by an endogenous bacterial acyltransferase which, unlike its eukaryotic counterparts, transfers the acyl chain not from acyl-CoA but from acyl-carrier protein. The acylated toxins secreted by the bacteria bind to the plasma membrane of the host cells, oligomerize and form pores causing cell lysis. In the case of the toxin of B. pertussis, essential is also the delivery of the adenylate cyclase moiety to the cell interior. Acylation is required for virulence possibly being involved in oligomerization of the toxins (23, 24, 138).\",\r\n        \"Although lacking S-palmitoylated proteins (with the single known exception of Evf), bacteria express a wide range of membrane-bound proteins modified by a complex lipidation at the N-terminus, with palmitate frequently being a component of the lipid moiety (139, 140). The bacterial lipoproteins are synthesized in a multistep process catalyzed by a unique set of lipoprotein processing enzymes, Lgt, LspA, and Lnt, absent in eukaryotic cells. The formation of these lipoproteins begins with the attachment of a diacylglycerol via a thioester bond to a cysteine residue located in the so-called lipobox motif of the signal sequence of the transmembrane lipoprotein precursor. The signal sequence is then cleaved next to the lipid-modified cysteine leaving it at the N-terminus of the mature protein (141). In Gram-negative and less frequently also Gram-positive bacteria, a third fatty acid residue is additionally attached via an amide linkage to the amino group of the cysteine in a reaction analogous to the N-acylation of hedgehog proteins (see Table 1). This di- and tri-lipidation ensures membrane anchoring of the lipoproteins. All such lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria are exposed to the milieu while in Gram-negative bacteria some face the periplasm. The lipoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae (causing pneumonia), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis), and Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis (meningitis), Y. pestis (plague), the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis) are crucial for their virulence. They control several aspects of the host–pathogen interactions, like adhesion and entry to host cells, protection against proteolysis and oxidative stress in the host cell, and regulation of expression of genes encoding cytokines both during initiation and progress of the disease (140–142). The surface exposure of the lipoproteins allows their involvement in the host cell invasion while on the other hand forming the so-called pattern signal recognized by the TLR2 receptor, which triggers the pro-inflammatory responses helping to combat the bacteria (143). Of interest, TLR2 is S-palmitoylated, as discussed below. The involvement of lipoproteins in pathogenesis fuels studies on their properties. One such recent work employing click chemistry to profile the lipoproteins of E. coli identified 88 lipoproteins with high/medium confidence, 70% of them predicted before by bioinformatics analysis (144). Notably, in that study a 14-carbon alkynyl fatty acid analog alk-14 rather than alk-16 was preferentially incorporated into the lipoproteins, contradicting earlier studies using gas chromatography and TLC, which found that palmitate was predominantly used for bacterial protein modification (139). Further studies are required to establish whether the fatty acid found in lipoproteins varies depending on culture conditions or is species specific. For example, 17ODYA labeling for click reaction confirmed incorporation of palmitate into pallilysin (Tp0751), a lipoprotein of T. pallidum. Pallilysin is a metalloprotease that degrades human fibrinogen and laminin. It is suggested that its exposure on the bacteria surface enables degradation of host structural proteins to facilitate rapid dissemination of this highly invasive pathogen (140).\",\r\n        \"Bacteria occasionally high-jack the palmitoylation machinery of host cells to modify the environment so as to favor their internalization, survival, and replication inside the cells. Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) is an example of such bacteria that modify S-palmitoylation of host proteins to their ends. The anthrax toxin produced by this pathogen binds to the TEM8 and CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis protein-2) proteins which, under physiological conditions, are involved in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions. They are S-palmitoylated at multiple (two to four) cysteines (54). The S-palmitoylation of TEM8 was found to inhibit its association with plasma membrane rafts preventing its ubiquitination by the raft-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl. The binding of anthrax toxin drives association of the receptor-toxin complexes with rafts possibly correlated with depalmitoylation of the receptor. This allows subsequent ubiquitination of the receptor, an uptake of the receptor/toxin complexes in a clathrin-dependent manner and eventual delivery of the toxin to endosomes. These events are facilitated by S-palmitoylation of partner(s) of the receptors, most likely including kinases of the Src family (54, 145, 146).\",\r\n        \"While B. anthracis utilizes palmitoylated host proteins to induce its internalization, a growing body of data suggests that also bacterial proteins can undergo S-palmitoylation inside the host cells. This type of modification concerns so-called effectors, bacterial proteins that are injected into the host cell cytoplasm either across the plasma membrane or the membrane of vesicles enclosing internalized pathogens, with the help of their secretion systems. These are secretion systems type III and type IV, homologs of which have been described for pathogens and symbionts of mammals, insects, and plants (147, 148). The bacterial effectors can be S-palmitoylated to reach host cell membranes and thereby accumulate at a location most suitable for their activity. Application of the click chemistry-based method utilizing an analog of palmitic acid (alk-16) for cell labeling has revealed S-palmitoylation of two effector proteins of Salmonella enterica, such as SspH2 and SseI (149). S. enterica invades gut endothelial cells and is a leading cause of gastroenteritis and typhoid fever. SspH2 carries an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain while SseI shows sequence homology to bacterial proteins that have a deamidase activity, and inhibits migration of Salmonella-infected cells. The latter activity requires S-palmitoylation of SseI. Both proteins are stably S-palmitoylated, most likely by zDHH3 and zDHH7 of the host and bind to the plasma membrane in a palmitoylation-dependent manner (149). Also two effector proteins of the IpaH family of Shigella spp. were found to be S-palmitoylated in that study, suggesting that this modification can control the activity of effector proteins of other pathogens as well (149). Indeed, GobX and LpdA, effector proteins of Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease invading macrophages and lung endothelial cells, are S-palmitoylated as was found recently using click chemistry. LpdA is a phospholipase hydrolyzing various phosphatidylinositols while GobX is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. GobX is targeted in a palmitoylation-dependent manner to the Golgi apparatus, and LpdA to the plasma membrane and a subset of intracellular vesicles (150, 151). Thus, the diversified subcellular localization of bacterial effector proteins reflects that of eukaryotic proteins.\",\r\n        \"It is worth noting that global profiling of acylated proteins with the application of click chemistry and an alkyne-functionalized analog of myristic acid, alk-14, for cell labeling was effective in reveling the mechanism of action of Shigella flexneri effector protein IpaJ of type III secretion system. This is a unique protease that cleaves off the N-terminal myristoylated glycine. This proteolytic demyristoylation activity of IpaJ is specific toward Golgi-associated ARF/ARL family of GTPases regulating cargo transport through the Golgi apparatus, inhibition of which is apparently pivotal for virulence of the bacteria causing diarrhea in humans (152).\",\r\n        \"In addition to the S-palmitoylation of the effectors of pathogenic bacteria of mammals mentioned earlier, double acylation, N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation, has been reported of the so-called avirulence (Avr) proteins (effectors of type III secretion system) of Pseudomonas syringae, a causative agent of diverse plant diseases. Among them, AvrRpm1 and ArvB are N-myristoylated and S-palmitoylated by host acyltransferases at neighboring glycine and cysteine residues localized at the N-terminus of the proteins (similarly to eukaryotic kinases of the Src family), while in AvrPphB and two AvrPphB-like effectors—ORF4 and NopT, the double acylation motif is exposed after auto-cleavage of the proteins (similarly to some eukaryotic proteins cleaved by caspases). The acylation of the Avr proteins ensures their anchoring in the host plasma membrane, which is required for their functioning. In disease-susceptible plants Avr proteins contribute to successful infection; however, in plants expressing host resistance (R) genes they trigger plant defense signals, in both cases engaging plasma membrane-associated host proteins (153, 154).\",\r\n        \"The importance of palmitoylation of bacterial effector proteins for their infectivity is only beginning to be uncovered, in no small part owing to the development of the click chemistry-based method for detection of this protein modification. However, the strategy of high-jacking the host palmitoylation machinery to modify own proteins seems to be much more commonly employed by viruses.\",\r\n        \"Viruses do not encode palmitoyl acyltransferases but exploit extensively the host palmitoylation machinery to modify their proteins essential for infection of host cells and own replication. In fact, S-palmitoylation of proteins was discovered in 1979 as a modification of envelope glycoproteins of Sindbis virus and VSV. In those studies [3H]-palmitic acid was used for metabolic labeling of virus-infected cells and labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography (12, 155). Subsequently, a number of other viral proteins have been found to be palmitoylated using this approach.\",\r\n        \"The most-studied group of viral palmitoylated proteins is those found in enveloped viruses, i.e., viruses covered by a lipid bilayer obtained during their replication from a membrane of the host cell, such as the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. Influenza virus, HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are the best known enveloped viruses. The envelope is rich in transmembrane, often S-palmitoylated, glycoproteins called spikes, which can bind to cognate receptors on the host cell plasma membrane triggering endocytosis of the virion, mediate subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes allowing entry of the viral genome to the cytoplasm, and are also involved in the budding of newly formed virus particles from the cell. An example of such multifunctional palmitoylated transmembrane glycoproteins is HA present in the envelope of influenza virus together with another palmitoylated transmembrane protein, the matrix protein M2, which forms a proton channel earning the protein the name viroporin. As mentioned earlier, HA of influenza A virus is S-stearoylated and S-palmitoylated, respectively, at one cysteine residue located in the transmembrane domain of HA and two cysteines found in the cytoplasmic (intraviral) tail in close proximity to the membrane (156). On the other hand, M2 is S-palmitoylated on the amphiphilic helix located in the cytoplasmic part of the protein. Due to the S-palmitoylation and the presence of a cholesterol-binding motif the helix bends toward and associates with membranes (157, 158). During infection, HA binds to sialic acid residues of glycans localized on the surface of airway and alveolar epithelial cells. The bound virions are endocytosed and next the viral and endosome membranes fuse. The membrane fusion is driven by HA, which undergoes conformational changes induced by low pH of endosomes. Acidification of endosomes activates also the M2 proton channel activity, protons entering viral core facilitate dissociation of the viral genome which then moves to the nucleus where RNA replication occurs. The S-palmitoylation of HA is required for the fusion of the viral and endosome membranes at least in some subtypes of the virus while the ion channel activity of M2 is not dependent on its S-palmitoylation (159). Newly synthesized viral proteins and RNA are assembled into virions in the plasma membrane rafts which merge into lager platforms crucial for the virion assembly and budding off. The triple fatty acylation of HA is required for its targeting to plasma membrane rafts (160, 161). Besides S-palmitoylation, also the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain of HA determines its association with rafts (45). On the other hand, among the amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of HA no other than the two S-palmitoylated cysteines are required for viral assembly and replication, although it is still not clear whether raft targeting (in cooperation with the transmembrane fragment) is the only mechanism of their participation. It is proposed that they affect conformation of the HA tail controlling its interaction with structural matrix protein M1 lying beneath the viral envelope (162, 163). The budding off of the virion is facilitated by M2 which localizes at the edges of rafts as a result of a combination of its S-palmitoylation, cholesterol binding, and properties of the transmembrane fragment. M2 protein can create a “wedge” altering membrane curvature thereby facilitating membrane scission and release of the virion (157, 164).\",\r\n        \"The influenza virus S-palmitoylated proteins are the archetype for many other viral proteins. Thus, S-palmitoylated spike glycoproteins include S-protein of coronaviruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome virus), the fusion (F) protein of paramyxoviruses (e.g., measles virus), Env of retroviruses [e.g., HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)], and filoviruses (e.g., Ebola). Other viral proteins modified with palmitate are viroporins, such as E protein of coronaviruses, and also peripheral membrane proteins or nucleocapsid proteins absent in influenza virus. It has been found that S-palmitoylation of F13L, a peripheral protein of the envelope of vaccinia virus, controls the association of the protein with intracellular membranes, thereby the formation of the envelope (165). The core protein of the nucleocapsid of HCV resides on the surface of lipid droplets and binds in a palmitoylation-dependent manner to membranes of the droplet-associated endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, it recruits viral proteins and newly synthesized RNA for viral particle formation (166). Besides the interest in the role of viral protein S-palmitoylation for infectivity and possible use of host zDHHC enzymes as targets of anti-influenza drugs (167), viral proteins often serve as a model to study the consequences of fatty acylation for protein functioning and localization in distinct membrane domains (see S-Palmitoylation of Proteins and Its Influence on Protein Localization, Trafficking, and Stability of this review). Readers are referred to recent exhaustive reviews that consider these topics (36, 84, 168) while we will focus here on the recent advances in the field of viral protein palmitoylation brought about mainly by proteomic studies.\",\r\n        \"The click chemistry-based approach has led to the identification of S-palmitoylation in the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane spike protein Env of FIV, considered to be the cat equivalent of HIV-1. Env comprises three transmembrane gp41 glycoproteins and three associated gp120 which bind to CD4 receptor and coreceptors on the surface of T lymphocytes allowing fusion of the viral envelope and the plasma membrane and entry of viral capsid. Four cysteines in FIV Env are S-palmitoylated vis-a-vis two found in the Env of HIV-1. The two most membrane-proximal cysteines, 804 and 811, are required for the FIV membrane-fusion activity and incorporation of Env into virions (169), in agreement with the importance of Env S-palmitoylation for virion assembly of some HIV-1 strains (170–172). The assembly of HIV-1 virions takes place in plasma membrane rafts and is driven by N-myristoylated Gag protein which anchors and oligomerizes preferentially in these plasma membrane domains due to the presence of the fatty acyl chain (18).\",\r\n        \"The development of click chemistry-based methods allowed for the first time global profiling of acylated proteins in virus-infected cells. In addition to identifying acylated viral proteins this approach has also revealed how the viral infection modulates the acylation pattern of the host cell proteins. Thus far, click chemistry has been used to study protein myristoylation and palmitoylation in cells infected with HIV-1 and with HSV. In the latter case, the standard metabolic labeling with alkyne-functionalized myristic and palmitic acid analogs followed by click chemistry and mass spectrometry was combined with SILAC to discern between the changes in the extent of protein acylation and those in their abundance following viral infection. This approach allowed an elaborate quantitative analysis of host protein acylation and has revealed an overall downregulation of the level of both host protein modifications in infected cells. While the decreased content of myristoylated proteins resulted mainly from suppression of host protein synthesis, the drop in several S-palmitoylated proteins ensued from the inhibition of their palmitoylation in infected cells. The affected proteins were localized mainly to the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus and were involved in vesicle-mediated transport and ion transport. In addition, the study has expanded the list of HSV-encoded acylated (mostly palmitoylated) proteins that play different functions in the viral cycle, such as gE, gI, gK, US2, and US3 (110). Similar results pointing to global changes of host protein acylation were obtained upon analysis of protein myristoylation and palmitoylation in cells infected with HIV-1. In that study, the cells were labeled with analogs of palmitic or myristic acid tagged with an azide moiety for click chemistry reaction; however, the following mass spectrometry analysis did not address the relation between changes of protein acylation vs. alteration of protein level. The study identified 17 palmitoylated and 7 myristoylated proteins significantly differing in abundance between HIV-1 infected and uninfected cells. Several of the proteins affected by the infection were of host origin. The abundance of myristoylated proteins was in general increased while that of the palmitoylated ones—decreased in infected cells (173). In other words, the two studies have revealed that HSV and HIV-1 not only encode proteins that are acylated in the host cell but also alter the palmitoylation of host proteins, likely to adapt the cellular environment to favor their replication and budding. The majority of the acylated proteins affected by HIV-1 or HSV infection had not been described earlier in this context; therefore, further studies on these proteins could be crucial for better understanding of viral infection. Thus, the click chemistry-based approach has been highly effective in revealing changes of the host protein palmitoylation and opening new possibilities for the identification of novel antiviral drug targets.\",\r\n        \"The innate immune responses are the first line of active defense against microbial infections. The application of click chemistry-based and ABE methods and their use for large-scale analysis of protein palmitoylation in murine dendritic CD2.4 cells (10, 103), and murine macrophage-like RAW264 cells (14, 48) complemented by proteomic analysis of the raft fraction of those cells (47) have contributed significantly to the understanding of the role of palmitoylation of host receptors and signaling proteins involved in innate immune responses. Thus, the palmitoyl proteome analysis of murine dendritic cells unraveled S-palmitoylation of TLR2, a receptor expressed in cells of myeloidal lineage, which heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to bind bacterial tri- or diacylated lipoproteins, respectively, and also other microbial components, such as glycolipids (e.g., lipoarabinomannan) of Mycobacterium and yeast zymosan (174). Besides TLR2, two other human TLRs out of 10 ectopically expressed in HEK293 cell, flagellin receptor TLR5, and TLR10, a unique TLR negatively regulating the pro-inflammatory activity of TLR2, were also found to be palmitoylated. The S-palmitoylation site of human TLR2 was mapped to Cys609 adjacent to its transmembrane domain. The modification was present in unstimulated cells and was linked with up-regulation of the cell surface localization of TLR2. Mutation of Cys609 abolished the ability of the receptor to induce pro-inflammatory signaling in response to microbial ligands of TLR2 (10). Further studies are needed to reveal whether S-palmitoylation of TLR2 controls its association with rafts as sites of TLR2 activation (175) and/or affects endocytosis of the receptor, as found for the anthrax toxin receptor (54).\",\r\n        \"One of the most extensively studied TLRs, TLR4 activated by bacterial LPS, is not palmitoylated. Yet, saturated fatty acids have been indicated to trigger pro-inflammatory signaling of TLR4. Thus, the TLR4/MD2 receptor complex is involved in the pro-inflammatory outcome of a diet rich in palmitic acid, as was found when analyzing markers of inflammation in the heart and adipose tissue of high fat diet-fed mice (176, 177). The molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory properties of palmitic acid can involve its influence on the plasma membrane lipid order, hence raft organization, in a way that facilitates translocation of TLR4 (and TLR2) toward rafts (178, 179). Palmitic acid also directly binds to the TLR4-associated MD2 protein (177, 180). An influence of palmitic acid on sphingomyelin/ceramide metabolism, which enhances the LPS-induced responses, has also been considered (181). Recent proteomic studies based on 17ODYA labeling of RAW264 macrophage-like cells followed by click chemistry have revealed that stimulation of cells with LPS induces profound changes of the abundance of palmitoylated proteins (182). The data are in agreement with earlier findings showing that LPS induces accumulation of S-palmitoylated Lyn kinase in the raft-enriched fraction of cells, allowing it to downregulate TLR4 signaling (11). One of the upregulated S-palmitoylated proteins was type II phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIβ, which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate. It was shown that palmitoylation determines the involvement of the kinase in LPS-induced signaling (182). These data suggest that S-palmitoylated proteins, including enzymes catalyzing phosphatidylinositol synthesis and turnover, are important factors affecting the pro-inflammatory responses triggered by LPS.\",\r\n        \"Notably LPS induces production of TNFα, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is S-palmitoylated itself. TNFα is synthesized as a transmembrane 27-kDa precursor (tmTNFα) transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus and recycling endosomes (183). Human tmTNFα is S-palmitoylated at Cys30 located at the boundary between its transmembrane and cytosolic fragments, as was found independently by radiolabeling and by labeling with 17ODYA followed by click chemistry (184, 185). Poggi et al. (185) arrived at a complex model explaining how the S-palmitoylation of TNFα affects its activity (Figure 3A). The modification was shown to favor the association of tmTNFα with rafts. Upon cell activation, the extracellular domain of tmTNF is cleaved by ADAM17 metalloproteinase whereupon the soluble TNFα (sTNFα) is released to the extracellular milieu and activates TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2. As ADAM17 localizes to both non-raft and raft regions of the plasma membrane, the S-palmitoylation of tmTNFα does not affect its cleavage and production of the soluble cytokine. However, S-palmitoylated tmTNFα interacts with TNFR1 in rafts thereby reducing the binding of sTNFα and consequently reducing the sensitivity of the cell to this cytokine. In addition, the fragment of tmTNFα which remains after the release of sTNFα in rafts if further processed by intramembrane SPPL2a and 2b proteases giving rise to ICD (intracellular domain) of an own biological activity. By contrast, the non-raft fragment of the ADAM17-cleaved tmTNFα is rapidly degraded (185).\",\r\n        \"The transport and maturation of TNFα are also regulated by another posttranslational acylation, ε-N-myristoylation (22). As shown in Figure 3B, myristic acid residues are attached to two lysines (Lys19 and 20) of human tmTNFα. This modification is reversed by sirtuin 6 catalyzing the demyristoylation. Depletion of sirtuin 6 decreases the release of sTNFα since the ε-N-acylated TNFα precursor is redirected to and accumulates in lysosomes (90, 91). It is worth noting that exogenous palmitic acid stimulates the ε-N-myristoylation of tmTNFα, thereby reducing the release of sTNFα in favor of accumulation of tmTNFα in lysosomes (90, 91). This somehow surprising anti-inflammatory effect of palmitic acid can be explained by competitive binding between long-chain fatty acids (in this case, palmitic) and myristoylated substrates of sirtuin 6 found in vitro—(89) and adds a new dimension to the potential effects of palmitic acid.\",\r\n        \"S-palmitoylation of host proteins is also vital in antiviral defense. Viral nucleic acids, which are recognized by several TLRs and also cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors, induce robust production of type I interferons (IFNs), mainly INFα and IFNβ. The IFNα and IFNβ released from cells which first encounter viruses, e.g., dendritic cells, induce an antiviral reaction in an autocrine and paracrine manner upon binding to plasma membrane IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) consisting of subunits 1 and 2. Both human IFNAR subunits are S-palmitoylated, as has been found by classical radiolabeling. The S-palmitoylation of IFNAR1 on Cys463, localized near the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane domain, is required for downstream activation of STAT1 and STAT2 and the following transcription of IFNα-activated genes (186). Among the IFN-induced proteins, some have been shown to be palmitoylated, using click chemistry and ABE. They include the immunity-related GTPase Irgm1, BST2 also known as tetherin, and IFITM1 and 3 (10, 104). IFITMs are potent restriction factors against a wide range of enveloped viruses, e.g., influenza, West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses (187, 188). IFITMs localize primarily to endolysosomal membranes where they inhibit viral replication by blocking their fusion with these membranes and also facilitate virus degradation (187). The exact mechanism of this antiviral activity is not clear, but it seems to rely on a perturbation of the organization of endolysosomal membranes. This can be linked with the intramembrane topology of IFITMs and their S-palmitoylation. IFITM1 and 3 likely possess two loops embedded in but not spanning the membrane with both the N- and C-termini facing the cytoplasm (55, 189). S-palmitoylation of conserved cysteine residues adjacent to these loops, Cys71, 72, and 105 in murine IFITM3, contributes to the membrane binding, similarly as found earlier for caveolins (119, 189). The S-palmitoylation also facilitates clustering of IFITM3 in the membranes, which is of potential significance for its antiviral activity (103). In support of the latter, the antiviral capacity was markedly reduced for non-palmitoylated mutant forms of IFITM3 (103, 119). However, S-palmitoylation did not affect the endolysosomal localization or stability of IFITM3. Subsequent studies have revealed that the localization and degradation of murine IFITM3, both shaping its antiviral capacity, are orchestrated by numerous posttranslational modifications comprising polyubiquitination, tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src-family kinase Fyn, and methylation (189, 190). By contrast, S-palmitoylation alone of the closely related murine IFITM1 endowed it with an antiviral activity and enhanced stability by preventing proteasomal degradation (55), which indicates diverse effects of this modification on individual IFITM isoforms.\",\r\n        \"The presented data are only beginning to fill the gap which existed in our understanding of the role of protein palmitoylation in innate immune responses. For a long time, it was lagging behind that on acquired immune responses, in which a plethora of S-palmitoylated proteins have long been known to be involved. They include receptors (CD4 and CD8), tyrosine kinases of the Src family, transmembrane adaptor proteins (e.g., LAT, NTAL, and PAG/Cbp), and α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Their S-palmitoylation in most cases targets them to rafts and is a prerequisite for their involvement in the signaling pathways triggered by immunoreceptors [TCR, B cell receptor (BCR), and Fcγ and Fcε receptors] crucial for the acquired immune responses. An association of some components of these signaling pathways with tetraspanin-enriched domains has also been considered. These topics are discussed in several earlier reviews (44, 79, 191, 192). It is worth noting that large-scale proteomic analyses of fatty-acylated proteins of T cells (99, 104, 105, 122) and B cells (121), identifying numerous new palmitoylated proteins, have been published recently. Further studies will shed light on the possible engagement of those proteins in acquired immune responses and/or in the cross talk between the innate and the acquired immune system, in which phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are essential (193).\",\r\n        \"Protein S-palmitoylation affects their localization, trafficking, and stability. It has long been known as an important factor controlling signal transduction by the BCR and TCR receptors involved in acquired immune responses. It is now becoming evident that palmitic acid is also a key lipid affecting the diverse processes at the host–pathogen encounter. Palmitate is a component of bacterial LPS and lipoproteins; S-palmitoylation of viral, some bacterial, and numerous host proteins is recognized as a crucial factor affecting both the virulence of pathogens and the innate immune reactions of the host. Our understanding of the latter has benefited greatly from the development of novel methods of detection of this protein modification. Their application has led to the identification of numerous proteins involved in the host–pathogen interaction. The methods have also allowed high-throughput proteomic analysis of palmitoylation of proteins in infected cells, showing widespread changes of the host cell palmitoylome. Future studies will tell whether complex feedback loops comprising palmitoyl acyltransferases and acylthioesterases, similar to those of kinases and phosphatases carrying out protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, are involved in controlling protein S-palmitoylation in infected cells. Revealing how the S-palmitoylation of particular proteins is regulated during the host–pathogen interactions should allow its modulation to favor the host defense.\",\r\n        \"All authors

understood, but likely involve contributions from both the host and the pathogen. To appreciate the role that the host immune system plays in Mtb reactivation, we used relatively resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (CBA/J) mice, whose susceptibility phenotype is most apparent during late stages of infection, to represent differences in the natural progression of TB between different human populations. CBA/J mice have low numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells that produce relatively small amounts of IFN-γ [1]–[4]. CBA/J mice also have elevated amounts of IL-10 during Mtb infection [5], [6], contributing to their increased susceptibility to infection. However, the importance of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in this mouse strain remains unclear.\",\r\n        \"CD8+ T cells are an important component of the protective immune response to Mtb, as defined by studies showing that mice deficient in CD8+ T cells had impaired control of Mtb infection [7]–[10]. Although there is no consensus on the specific requirement for CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection, CD8+ T cells can contribute to Mtb control by secretion of IFN-γ [11], [12] and cytotoxic lysis of host cells [13], [14], yet their ability to maintain maximal effector function is dependent on CD4+ T cells [15]–[17]. Studies have also reported that CD8+ T cells are most important during latent Mtb infection in mice, and that CD8+ T cell depletion early after infection had little effect on disease outcome [18]. Conversely, other studies suggest that CD8+ T cells are dispensable during Mtb infection [19]–[21].\",\r\n        \"In chronic viral infection models, CD8+ T cells can become dysfunctional after chronic antigenic stimulation, characterized by a lack of functional or proliferative capability, secretion of IL-10 [22]–[24] and surface expression of inhibitory molecules, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (Tim-3) [25], [26]. PD-1 has classically been used as a marker of T cell exhaustion in viral infection and in cancer [27]–[30], while other studies have found that cells expressing Tim-3 are dysfunctional and lack regulation [31], [32], and that coexpression of PD-1 and Tim-3 leads to extensive dysfunction of CD8+ T cells [33]. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (the β subunit of the IL-2 receptor) have been shown to have suppressive qualities and secrete IL-10 [34]. We, and others, have previously demonstrated that Mtb susceptibility in CBA/J mice is mediated by excessive pulmonary IL-10 during infection [1], [2], [5], [35], [36], yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Although numerous cell types are capable of producing IL-10, studies have previously shown that IL-10-producing T cells can actively suppress the immune response in TB patients [37], supporting an investigation into the IL-10-producing properties of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection in CBA/J mice.\",\r\n        \"In this study we show that Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mice accumulated large numbers of CD8+ T cells in their lungs as Mtb infection progressed that could not be fully accounted for by an expansion of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cell expansions expressed the inhibitory molecules PD-1, Tim-3, and/or CD122, and were capable of secreting IL-10. CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice also preferentially expressed TcR Vβ8 and Vβ14, severely limiting the diversity of the CD8+ T cell repertoire. Although Vβ8 CD8+ T cells could secrete IL-10, in vivo depletion of this specific T cell clonal population during chronic infection did not overtly change the Mtb burden in the lungs in the timeframe tested, although the amount of IL-10 in the lung was reduced indicating some biological impact of depletion. Comparing mouse strains that are relatively resistant and susceptible to Mtb has enabled us to uncover a previously unappreciated role for CD8+ T cells in Mtb susceptibility, and links the poor T cell function previously described by us [4], [6], [36] with increased production of IL-10 in the CBA/J mouse strain.\",\r\n        \"This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

To generate CBA/J IL-10−/− mice, CBA/J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine) were crossed with C57BL/6 IL-10−/− mice (Jackson) for eight generations. At each cross progeny mice were ear-punched and DNA was screened for the presence of a neomycin cassette at the il10 gene locus. IL-10+/− mice were selected for further breeding. At the eighth generation, heterozygotes were crossed and IL-10-deficient homozygote CBA/J mice were selected. A homozygous breeder colony of CBA/J IL-10−/− mice was maintained thereafter.

In contrast to the reduced number of CD4+ T cells, CBA/J mice demonstrated a significant late accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs as Mtb infection progressed (\\nFig. 1b\\n), eventually reaching or surpassing the number of pulmonary CD8+ T cells observed in C57BL/6 mice. This late accumulation was absent from C57BL/6 mice which reached a plateau at day 60. Skewing of T cell subset proportions in CBA/J mice could be better appreciated by determination of CD4∶CD8 ratios throughout the course of infection (\\nFig. 1c\\n), where a significant decline in the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was observed by day 90 of Mtb infection, preceding the increasing CFU within the lungs of CBA/J mice (\\nFig. 1d\\n) [4], [6]. BrdU staining of pulmonary CD4+ (\\nFig. 1e\\n) and CD8+ T (\\nFig. 1f\\n) cells from CBA/J mice was not dramatically altered throughout infection, suggesting that the increased numbers of CD8+ T cells that were evident in CBA/J mice may not be due to local proliferation, but a consequence of enhanced cellular recruitment. CBA/J mice are known to produce abundant IL-10 in their lungs as Mtb infection progresses [5] and IL-10 can stimulate the proliferation of CD8+ T cells [41]. Therefore, we examined the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in the lungs of CBA/J IL-10−/− mice over the course of Mtb infection (\\nFig. 1g, h\\n) and did not observe any differences between wild-type and IL-10−/− CBA/J mice in CD8+ T cell accumulations at late stages of infection, demonstrating that CD8+ T cell expansions occur independent of IL-10. A significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10−/− mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced TH1 immunity in these mice (unpublished observations). These data demonstrate that the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10.\",\r\n        \"We examined the number of T cells that were capable of secreting IFN-γ after ex vivo TcR stimulation. As expected, C57BL/6 mice had increasing numbers of CD4+\\n[4] and CD8+ T cells that could produce IFN-γ as infection progressed (\\nFig. 2a\\n), which paralleled the increasing numbers of T cells within the lung (\\nFig. 1\\n). CBA/J showed an equivalent increase in IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells (\\nFig. 2b\\n), albeit at a significantly lower number compared to C57BL/6, as we have previously described [3], [4]. Where the data differed, however, was in the finding that the number of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells reached a plateau as early as day 30 post-infection and did not increase any further, despite a significant accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the lungs of CBA/J mice. As Mtb infection progressed we also observed a significant increase in the number of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice that could express CD69 (\\nFig. 2c\\n), with over 40% of all CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice being activated during chronic infection. CD8+ T cells also expressed the suppressor of TH1 responses Tim-3 (\\nFig. 2d\\n), PD-1 (\\nFig. 2e\\n), with a small population expressing both PD-1 and CD122 (\\nFig. 2f\\n). Therefore, although highly activated, a proportion of CD8+ T cell expansions from chronic Mtb infected CBA/J mice had a phenotype that was not associated with TH1 cytokine secretion but was instead linked to immuno-suppressive properties including IL-10 production [34]. Because IL-10 production has been closely linked to Mtb susceptibility of CBA/J mice [5], we next examined the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10.\",\r\n        \"CD8+ and CD8neg cells were purified from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice and cultured in IL-10 ELISpot plates for 72 hours with autologous bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) that had been infected with Mtb for 24 hours, in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. CD8+ cells from CBA/J mice, and not C57BL/6 mice, were capable of secreting IL-10 in response to TcR cross-linking (\\nFig. 3a\\n). In contrast, CD8neg cells from both mouse strains were capable of secreting IL-10 under these same conditions (\\nFig. 3b\\n). IL-10-secreting CD8neg cells were predominantly CD4+ as adherent cells were removed during cell purification and we have failed to detect IL-10 within B cells and neutrophils in both mouse strains (not shown). We also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J and C57BL/6 mice were capable of secreting IFN-γ under the same culture conditions (measured in the IL-10 ELISPOT supernatants) (\\nFig. 3c\\n). Culture of purified CD8+ and CD8neg cells from Mtb infected CBA/J mice with Mtb-infected BMDCs in the absence of TcR cross-linking, indicative of an Mtb-specific response, resulted in the secretion of IL-10 from both CD8neg and CD8+ cells (\\nFig. 3d\\n). Interestingly, the capacity of CD8+ T cells to produce IL-10 increased over time, in parallel to the increasing CFU and CD8+ T cell numbers in the lung. The low SFU, relative to TcR cross-linking likely reflects the challenges of delivering of Mtb antigen into the appropriate processing pathway for presentation to CD8+ T cells.\",\r\n        \"We determined the clonal repertoire of the CD8+ T cells that accumulated in the lungs of CBA/J mice during Mtb infection to determine whether the reactivity of CD8+ T cells was potentially driven by a dominant antigen, a concept supported by the finding of T cell clonal expansions in TB patients [42], [43]. At late stages of Mtb infection, we observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice primarily expressed two variable regions of the TcR beta chain (Vβ). Vβ8 (8.2,8.3) and Vβ14 were expressed by approximately 45% of all CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection, compared to a less restrictive repertoire in C57BL/6 mice (\\nFig. 4a\\n). Vβ expression was comparable on CD4+ T cells from both mouse strains (\\nFig. 4b\\n), indicating a unique expansion within the CD8+ T cell pool in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progressed. More detailed examination over the course of Mtb infection showed that the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing Vβ8 or Vβ14 was always significantly higher throughout Mtb infection in CBA/J mice, and this population significantly expanded further at late time points of Mtb infection (\\nFig. 4c, d\\n). Similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell expansions, we found that both Vβ8 and Vβ14 CD8+ T cells were highly activated (\\nFig. 4e\\n).\",\r\n        \"We determined the IL-10 producing capacity of CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells using magnetic bead separation, which purified the dominant Vβ8 expressing CD8+ population. CD8+ Vβ8+ and CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells were isolated from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice or C57BL/6 mice (controls) at day 150 post Mtb infection and cultured in IL-10 ELISpot plates with autologous IL-10 deficient BMDCs in the presence of anti-CD3/CD28. Significantly more CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were capable of producing IL-10 than CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells from CBA/J mice or from CD8+ Vβ8+ and CD8+ Vβ8neg T cells from C57BL/6 mice (\\nFig. 4f\\n). These data indicate a dominant role for CD8+ Vβ8+ expressing T cells in the IL-10 production we previously observed in purified CD8+ T cell cultures. Culture supernatants were also assayed for IFN-γ by ELISA (\\nFig. 4g\\n) and our data indicate that CD8+ Vβ8+ T cells can have dual secretion of IL-10 and IFN-γ, or represent a mixed population, as has been described by others [44].\",\r\n        \"CD8+ T cells or Vβ8+ cells were depleted from wild-type CBA/J mice from day 90–120 after Mtb infection, a time when IL-10 and Vβ8+ CD8+ T cells were increasing in the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice [5]. Following CD8+ depletion, Mtb CFU (\\nFig. 5a\\n), total CD4+ T cell numbers (\\nFig. 5b\\n) and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells (\\nFig. 5c\\n) were all moderately altered but data did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, CD8+ T cell depletion led to a significant decrease in the total amount of IL-10 in the lungs of CBA/J mice (\\nFig. 5d\\n), reflecting the IL-10-secreting capacity of CD8+ T cells we observed in vitro. Depletion of CD4+ T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden and mortality before day 120 (not shown) showing that depletion of a known protective T cell subset increased susceptibility. Specific depletion of Vβ8+ cells also failed to significantly impact the Mtb burden (\\nFig. 5e\\n), although a modest reduction in CFU was similarly observed. This modest reduction, similar to our findings with CD8+ T cell depletion, suggests that although IL-10 producing CD8+ T cells may not negatively impact the growth of Mtb during the timeframe we investigated, they do not provide protection.\",\r\n        \"We have demonstrated that clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice accumulate in the lung over the course of Mtb infection. This accumulation did not yield an equivalent increase in IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells and, upon further phenotypic examination, we discovered that highly activated CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice expressed the T cell dysfunction markers PD-1 and Tim-3, as well as co-expression of PD-1 and CD122 suggesting possible immunosuppressive activity. After ex vivo purification and culture, it was shown that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice were capable of secreting IL-10 after TcR stimulation and in response to Mtb infected BMDCs. Depletion of Vβ8+ cells or the entire CD8+ T cell population in Mtb-infected CBA/J mice led to a significant reduction in pulmonary IL-10 levels, however, we observed no significant change in pulmonary CFU.\",\r\n        \"Using an Mtb-susceptible mouse strain, we reveal that CD8+ T cells that are capable of producing IL-10 can accumulate within the lung during Mtb infection. CD8+ T cells within the lung expressed CD69, indicative of activation and functional capacity, yet failed to show a concomitant enhancement of IFN-γ-producing capacity. These findings indicate that highly activated CD8+ T cells within the lung have alternate function, which we show here to be the capacity to secrete IL-10, measured by ELISPOT due to the known difficulties of measuring IL-10 by intracellular flow cytometry. Altered function was associated with the co-expression of a variety of receptors know for negative regulation of cell function (PD-1, CD122, Tim-3) [25], [28], [33], [34]. In support of our findings, previous studies have shown that in chronic murine Mtb infection PD-1+ T cells can proliferate but fail to secrete IFN-γ unless this inhibition is overcome by direct TcR stimulation [45], [46]. It is unclear at this time why CD8+ T cells with inhibitory properties arise in CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progresses but we can hypothesize that this is a consequence of enhanced immune activation and subsequent exhaustion due to increasing bacterial loads in this mouse strain (Fig. 1) [4], [6].\",\r\n        \"Our failure to observe any significant change in CFU following CD8+ or Vβ8+ T cell depletion can be interpreted in several ways, the simplest being that IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells have no biological influence on the control of Mtb infection. While this is a possibility, we would reason that at the least the presence of IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells can be a putative biomarker of TB disease progression as they are only observed in a mouse strain of Mtb susceptibility, and IL-10 producing T cells have been previously described in the blood of TB patients [37]. In support of a negative role for CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice, in vivo depletion led to a moderate, albeit not significant, decrease in CFU. Thus is in contrast to CD4+ T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point (data not shown). These findings indicate that some CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice fail to contribute to protection in a similar manner than might be expected from studies of other mouse strains [47]–[49]. One possibility for our failure to detect significant changes in CFU following CD8+ T cell depletion is our observation that CD8+ T cells can secrete both IL-10 and IFN-γ. Depletion of all CD8+ T cells would also remove a protective population, leading to a neutral effect. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that blocking the action of IL-10 in CBA/J mice during Mtb infection provides enhanced protection [5], and we consider that blocking the action of IL-10 from IL-10/IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells contributed to this phenotype.\",\r\n        \"In addition to IL-10 production, we also observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice had severely restricted diversity of their TcR repertoire which would significantly limit the breadth of antigens that CBA/J CD8+ T cells can recognize. CBA/J mice have an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV-6) that selectively deletes various TcR Vβ chains such as Vβ8.1, and Vβ 17a [50], [51] however this alone is not sufficient to explain the limited TcR diversity in CBA/J mice. It is possible that Mtb infection leads to specific deletion of certain subsets of protective CD8+ T cells or is driving clonal expansion of less protective cells (Vβ8, Vβ14). Alternatively Vβ8/Vβ14 CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice may respond to a dominant Mtb antigen(s) expressed in vivo, where persistent responsiveness leads to immune exhaustion and subsequent regulation through receptors such as PD-1 and Tim-3. Clonal CD8+ expansions have been described in TB patients [52], including pediatric TB [42], supporting the relevance of our findings to TB in man. Clonal CD8+ expansions are also common in the elderly and in many viral models [42], [43], [53]–[58], yet their importance in Mtb infection is still unclear.\",\r\n        \"In summary, we show using an Mtb-susceptible mouse strain (CBA/J) that clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-10 can arise during chronic Mtb infection. In combination with our previous finding that blocking the action of IL-10 can improve outcome of Mtb infection [5], these data further support a negative role for IL-10 in the generation and maintenance of protective immunity against Mtb infection. Our findings are of significance because vaccines that specifically stimulate CD8+ T cells are currently under development [59]–[63]. Given that IL-10-secreting CD8+ T cells with the potential to negatively impact control of Mtb infection can naturally arise, generating such cells in response to vaccination should be considered.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {\r\n        sciwingI2B2: {\r\n          \"0,9\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,10\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,11\": \"problem\",\r\n          \"0,25\":

human beings raises a serious concern worldwide. New viral diseases have been reported continuously with severe health issues, and the lack of effective antiviral treatment makes them more severe (Kapoor et al. 2017). Most of the viral diseases like influenza, HIV, and chikungunya and other diseases caused by alphaviruses and flaviviruses are emerging with the great risk. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected world’s population severely. Nowadays, the development of effective treatment and antivirals against virus has become difficult, due to the ability of viruses to mutate their genome and become resistant to drugs (Irwin et al. 2016). Moreover, the antiviral drugs also exhibit adverse side effects, which directly and indirectly affect the human health. This leads towards the development of plant-based drugs and herbal treatments with minimal side effects (Biswas et al. 2019). Human depends on the traditional plants to fulfill their basic necessities. Plant-based anti-infection treatments are attracting the focus of modern world healthcare researchers, because of the minimal side effects with effective health benefits. Over the past few years, plant-based drug discovery has been continuously evaluated for its antibacterial, antiviral, anticancerous, and antioxidant activities (Biswas et al. 2019; Lillehoj et al. 2018). Moreover, the antiviral activities of plant-based compounds have been evaluated for emerging viral diseases. Plant-based antiviral natural compounds are the most suitable and best alternative of antiviral medicines/inhibitors/drugs, because of less toxicity (Lillehoj et al. 2018). Plant-based potential bioactive compounds, having antiviral properties have been proved superior, and could be combined with the preexisting therapies, along with the different delivery methods to enhance the effectiveness of antiviral along with good bioavailability (Kapoor et al. 2017).\",\r\n        \"Viruses possess DNA or RNA genome with protein envelops, and depend on the host metabolism and environment to replicate and survive. They exploit the cellular machinery of host and disseminate throughout the body (Helenius 2018). Viruses have the ability to invade and adopt evasion strategies, which is an important challenge during the development of antivirals. Since the plants have metabolites/chemicals with variety of properties, they could be evaluated and used to counter the evasion and drug-resistance difficulties related with the antivirals, and thus will inhibit the viral dissemination (Irwin et al. 2016). There are several mechanisms, which govern the antiviral activity of phytochemicals. For instance, few of the antiviral phytochemicals, which bind to carbohydrate moiety tend to target the cell entry (Idris et al. 2016). This approach limits the viral penetration, resists its coating, and eventually inhibits the growth of viruses. Additionally, some of the compounds directly inhibit viral replication and hence prevent its propagation (Kapoor et al. 2017). Herein, we will focus on the plant-based antivirals reported to inhibit viral replication and the mode of their action.\",\r\n        \"Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary compounds of plants with several properties, such as anticancerous, antimicrobial, and antiviral. Flavonoids are widely present in many fruits, seeds, and vegetables as a result of abiotic stress (Carletti et al. 2014; Zakaryan et al. 2017). Flavonoids are being constantly researched upon for antiviral activities (Jacob and Thomas 2019). EGCG is one of the flavonoids, and is an important component of green tea. It has been reported to have antiviral activity against rotavirus strain SA-11 (Lipson et al. 2017). Zakaryan et al. reported baicalein, another flavonoid (flavone), having antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Baicalein is also reported for the inhibition of different stages of the replication of dengue virus. Fisetin and quercetagetin fall under the category of flavonols, and are exploited for their antiviral activities (Zakaryan et al. 2017). Fisetin was successfully reported to inhibit the replication of dengue virus and enterovirus A71 in vitro (Min et al. 2018). The inhibition of hepatitis C virus and the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection was done by the activity of quercetagetin (Zakaryan et al. 2017). Moreover, baicalein, quercetagetin, and fisetin were also reported for the inhibition of chikungunya virus by impeding the intracellular viral replication at early stages (Lani et al. 2016). Phenolic acids have shown significant antiviral activity against HSV-1 very significantly (Medini et al. 2016). Similarly, stilbenes have shown antiviral properties against HIV and HCV (Gastaminza et al. 2011; Krawczyk 2019). Fan and co-workers reported luteolin, a nontoxic dietary flavonoid with antiviral activity against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Luteolin belongs to the flavone group of flavonoids and is present in chamomile tea, perilla leaf, green pepper, and celery. The virucidal activity of luteolin was observed in A549 cell lines infected with JEV, and reported that luteolin inhibits the viral replication at the post entry of virus. Luteolin did not inhibit the replication at the time of viral entry (Fan et al. 2016). More recently, a group of researchers have identified pinocembrin having anti-Zika activity. They screened a library containing flavonoids against Zika virus. They analyzed cell viability and viral titers and finally identified pinocembrin (present in honey, tea, and red wine) as an anti-Zika compound. It was observed that the pinocembrin strongly inhibited the Zika virus infection in JEG-3-infected cells, and also revealed that it inhibits the viral replication at post entry stages inside the cell (Lee et al. 2019). Likewise, LeCher et al. (2019) have identified the potential phytochemical that is effective against herpes B virus. They have reported genistein, a flavonoid present in Fabaceae family and in soy-based foods. Due to the lack of permanent treatment of herpes B virus, the researchers also checked the synergistic effects of genistein with the already available antivirals (acyclovir and ganciclovir) to develop the effective treatment. They have reported the antiviral activity of genistein against herpes B virus, and also revealed that it targets the virus after the viral replication stage. Moreover, its combination with the acyclovir and ganciclovir proved to be effective with the reduction of effective dose (LeCher et al. 2019). Similarly, genistein has been reported to possess antiviral activity against HSV-1, cytomegalovirus, and bovine herpesvirus-1, SV40, human papilloma virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, African swine fever virus, and HIV (LeCher et al. 2019). Anti-simian rotavirus SA-11 activity of the ethanolic extracts was reported from the leaves of medicinal plant (Myracrodruon urundeuva), found in Brazil (Cecílio et al. 2016). Further, they have investigated the crude extracts to analyze the activity of pure concentrated bioactive compounds and did the evaluation of the virucidal activity against rotavirus SA-11. They have fractioned five compounds from the leaves using TLC and HPLC and checked their anti-rotavirus activity. They have identified that the flavonoid-enriched fraction showed the strongest anti-rotavirus activity (Cecílio et al. 2016). More recently, Iloghalu et al. (2019) researched on the plant extracts to identify the effective antiviral against noroviruses, which has yet no treatment and control. They worked on the phytochemicals extracted from seeds and calyces of Zanthoxylum armatum and Hibiscus sabdariffa to identify the antiviral activity. Also, they selected myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin phenolic compounds and observed viral reduction activity by using norovirus-infected RAW 264.7 cell lines. According to them, quercetin was able to considerably reduce the viral titer, and hence suggested that it can be used in controlling the human norovirus infections (Iloghaluet al. 2019). In a study, 500 compounds in flavonoid library were screened for antiviral activities, and finally selected as the top leading flavonoids (ST077124 and ST024734) and elucidated their antiviral activity against human enterovirus A71 (HEVA71) infection. These leads proved to be effective at the noncytotoxic concentration of 50 μM and significantly diminished the viral titers. The compound ST077124 inhibits the human enteroviruses, but another identified compound ST024734 showed the antiviral activity for the infection caused by human enteroviruses, as well as for dengue virus. Both of the compounds hindered the transcription and translation machinery of the virus, and the researchers suggested that these compounds could be the potential inhibitors of HEVA71 (Min et al. 2018). A group of investigators have demonstrated the antiviral activities of Ficus cunninghamii. This plant has been found to contain several flavonoids, such as quercetin-3-O-α-d-arabinopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-β-d-galactopyranoside, kaempferol-3-O-β-d-galactopyranoside, and kaempferol-3-O-α-d-arabinopyranoside. They studied the radical scavenging activity and reported the importance of hydroxyl group (–OH) for the activity of flavonoids. The presence of more number of –OH group enhanced the antioxidant activity of flavonoids. They identified and reported that the flavonoid from F. cunninghamii has mild inhibitory effect against hepatitis A virus (Orabi and Orabi 2016). A comparative study on the antiviral activity of flavonoids (EGCG, ECG, quercetin, daidzein, fisetin, baicalein, kaempferol, biochanin A, theaflavin, and digallate) against murine norovirus (MNV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) was carried out by Seo et al. (2016). These flavonoids were earlier reported to have an antiviral activity against RNA viruses (Sithisarn et al. 2013; Seo et al. 2016). The results of Seo et al.’s (2016) study concluded that the antiviral activity against MNV and FCV of these flavonoids was found to be in the following order: quercetin < daidzein < fisetin < EGCG and ECG < quercetin < daidzein < kaempferol, respectively. FCV viral titer was significantly reduced by the activity of kaempferol and daidzein at 200 mM concentration level. Moreover, the MNV viral titer was reduced by daidzein and quercetin, when used at the concentration of 50 and 100 mM, respectively (Seo et al. 2016). In another study by Bang et al. (2016), the aerial parts of Salvia plebeia R. Br were analyzed for antiviral activity against influenza A (H1N1) neuraminidase. Two of the flavonoids showed antiviral efficacy against H1N1 virus by inhibiting the replication cycle. These flavonoids were found to be potential inhibitors of H1N1 neuraminidase and thus inhibited the growth of the virus (Bang et al. 2016). More recently, the anti-dengue activity of plants found in Indonesia (Myristica fatua, Cymbopogon citratus, and Acorus calamus) was observed by Rosmalena et al. (2019). They have performed in silico as well as in vitro experiments to elucidate the antiviral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). Although the solvent extracts of all the plants showed the inhibitory effect, the highest inhibition was recorded for the methanolic extracts of M. fatua. Hence, they suggested the plant for further exploration to make use of it in the herbal formulations in the treatment of dengue virus (Rosmalena et al. 2019). Moreover, by using in silico studies, Anusuya and co-workers have reported that some of the phytocompounds, such as 5-hydroxy-3,3′,4′,6,7,8-hexamethylflavone, 4′,5,6,7-tetramethylflavone, and 7″-methylamentoflavone, possess the potential of inhibiting dengue virus (Anusuya and Gromiha 2019).\",\r\n        \"Alkaloids, a type of secondary metabolite of plants consist of the presence of nitrogen atom in its ring structure. Alkaloids are generally present in the higher plants and comprise of various biological activities like anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, and antiasthma (Shi et al. 2014). It has been reported that about 43 alkaloids exhibit activity against the influenza virus (Moradi et al. 2018). The antiviral activity against influenza virus by the alkaloids can be due to induction of interferons of the immune system. Some of the alkaloids enhance the activity of macrophages, hence phagocytose to destroy the virus. Alkaloids inhibit the influenza viral infection at different stages of replication. Some of them either inhibit the synthesis of viral proteins or hinder at the other stages of replication (Moradi et al. 2018). In a study by Zhang et al. (2013), it is reported that homonojirimycin (HNJ), an alkaloid extracted from Commelina communis, exhibits a strong inhibitory activity against influenza viral infection. They also carried out in vivo studies, in which the mice infected with the H1N1 showed a good survival rate, when administered with HNJ by developing good immune response against influenza (Zhang et al. 2013). Dendrobine, an alkaloid present in the plant root of Dendrobium nobile, has been analyzed by Li et al. (2017) for its antiviral activity. They reported the antiviral property of dendrobine against influenza A viruses. Their studies revealed that dendrobium failed to inhibit the virus during the viral entry, but reduced the viral titer during viral replication. Dendrobine has the ability to bind the nucleoprotein of virus, restraining the viral replication, and hence restricts its export. Moreover, the synergistic effects of dendrobine and zanamivir (a medication used to treat and prevent influenza) were shown to significantly inhibit the influenza A virus replication (Li et al. 2017). More recently, several synthetic compounds were synthesized, including alkaloid analogues, and investigated for their influenza virus inhibition activity (Chernyshov et al. 2019). According to their study results, these compounds successfully inhibited the viral infection and exhibited the antiviral activity against various influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N2). Wu et al. (2012) extracted alkaloids from the marine-derived fungus Dichotomomyces cejpii F31-1, and elucidated the antiviral activity for the inhibition of dengue virus (Wu et al. 2012). Moreover, Kaushik et al. (2018) reported alkaloids from the plants like Castanospermum australe, Houttuynia cordata, Myrtopsis corymbosa, and Uncaria tomentosa to possess antiviral activity against dengue virus (Kaushik et al. 2018). The preliminary screening of phytochemicals in Phaleria macrocarpa plant showed the presence of alkaloids along with several other phytocompounds. These plant extracts were shown to exhibit nontoxicity to Vero cells, but showed strong antiviral properties against HSV (Ismaeel et al. 2018a, b). Likewise, the methanol extract of Ziziphus jujube plant was shown to have eight cyclopeptide alkaloids. Out of which, three alkaloids showed inhibitory effects against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) using the cytotoxicity assay and cytopathic effect inhibition assay (Kang et al. 2015). Enantia chlorantha (Oliver), a traditional medicinal plant, has been in use in Nigeria for curing malaria fever, caused by Plasmodium spp. This plant has been found to have antiviral activity against hepatitis A, B, C, and D. The alkaloids, such as berberine present in the stem bark of this plant have been assessed by Ohemu et al. (2018) against Newcastle disease virus, and the results showed that alkaloids exhibited toxic effects to the viruses.\",\r\n        \"Terpenes consist of five carbon isoprene units with simple hydrocarbons, and belong to the biggest category of secondary metabolites. On the other hand, terpenoids are just the modified forms of terpenes with various functional groups at different positions. Terpenoids, also called as isoprenoids are natural compounds present in plants and have a significant role in pharmaceuticals, therapeutics, and herbal treatments. Terpenoids like diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and triterpenoids have wide variety of application in the area of medicine (Jaeger and Cuny 2016; Perveen and Al-Taweel 2018).\",\r\n        \"Kazakova et al. (2018) studied the antiviral activity of betulin and dihydroquinopimaric acid derivatives against influenza A virus (H7N1), HSV type 1, non-enveloped RNA virus (ECHO 6), and HIV type 1. The modification at C3 and C28 of betulic acid showed the antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HIV-1. Moreover, the modifications at the C4 position of dihydroquinopimaric acid enhanced the anti-H7N1 activity. Due to the lack of cost-effective treatment and the nonavailability of vaccines for HCV, researchers have moved towards the prospective phytochemical-based therapy, which could be more economical and effective. It has been reported that saikoponins, such as SSa, SSb2, SSc, and SSd isolated from the Bupleurum kaoi root, inhibited the infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Lin et al. 2015). It was reported that saikoponins targeted the viral cycle at their very early steps like viral entry/fusion and not the later phase like transcription and translation of viral cycle. SSb2 was the most effective alkaloid, which significantly inhibited the HCV infection (Lin et al. 2015). The activity of Phyllanthus urinaria plant extract against the HCV early entry was observed by Chung et al. (2016). According to their study, the presence of loliolide, a monoterpene hampered the viral attachment to the host membrane, and thus inhibited its entry. Corlay et al. (2014) analyzed the ethanolic extract from the leaves of Croton mauritianus plant and identified the presence of diterpenes, such as 12-O-decanoylphorbol-13-acetate and 12-O-decanoyl-7-hydroperoxy-phorbol-5-ene-13-acetate along with loliolide, vomifoliol, dehydrovomifoliol, annuionone D, and bluemol C. Among these phytoconstituents, 12-O-decanoylphorbol 13-acetate and 12-O-decanoyl-7-hydroperoxy-phorbol-5-ene-13-acetate showed significant anti-chikungunya activity (Corlay et al. 2014). In a study to evaluate the potential antiviral activity of Aglaia sp. (family, Meliaceae) (Esimone et al. 2010), the presence of terpenes was identified, which could inhibit HIV-1 by creating a cytotoxic environment and resisting the proliferation of the virus. The terpenes also showed the inhibition of several other viruses, such as retroviruses, including simian immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemic virus. The 3, 4-secodammarane triterpenoid was observed to inhibit cell cycle between S and G2/M phase, and thus inhibiting the viral replication and dissemination. Terpenes present in the methanolic extract of Marrubium vulgare were studied for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 through plaque reduction assay (Fayyad et al. 2014). They reported that terpenes could disrupt the attachment of HSV to the cell membrane and interfere in the replication of HSV-1 virus. Likewise, terpenes (oleanolic terpenoids) extracted from the Camellia japonica flowers were analyzed by Yang et al. (2015) for their antiviral activity against PEDV. These compounds suppressed the viral replication by restraining the proper structural formation and inhibited genes coding for GP2 spike, GP5membrane protein, and GP6 nucleocapsid (Yang et al. 2015).\",\r\n        \"Lignans are the phenolic secondary metabolites of plants. Lignans are observed to be antihepatotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antidepressant. Furthermore, many lignans have been found to be antiviral against HIV and influenza (Hazra and Chattopadhyay 2016; Salehi et al. 2018). A lignin bisphenol, namely honokiol, was identified from Magnolia tree by Fang et al. (2015), and the tree parts are routinely used in the Chinese medicine. The treatment of honokiol to dengue virus strains revealed that it could inhibit the synthesis of dsRNA, and interfere in the replication process. The nonstructural proteins, particularly ns1 and ns3, and the intermediate proteins formed during replication were observed to be suppressed by honokiol. The phytochemical studies also revealed that it may affect the endocytic entry of dengue virus, and hence reduce the number of viral particles in the cytoplasm (Fang et al. 2015). A lignan, 3-hydroxy caruilignan C (3-HCL-C), was extracted from the stems of Swietenia macrophylla, and it was found to be effective against chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Wu et al. 2012). Moreover, the antiviral activity of 3-HCL-C in combination with interferon-α (IFN-α), an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor (2’-C-methylcytidine; NM-107), or telaprevir (an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor) reduced the viral infection significantly. This lignin inhibited the virus at both translation and transcriptional phases. Several other studies have demonstrated the similar activity of 3-HCL-C against HIV-1, hepatitis B, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Wu et al. 2012). A prominent presence of bombasinol, a lignan, is observed in many plants belonging the Bombacaceae family. Upon researching, it was found that this compound had the inhibitory activity against hepatitis B virus (Wang et al. 2013). Furthermore, Pilkington et al. (2018) isolated phytochemicals from the seeds of Silybum marianum and elucidated their antiviral activities against HCV. More recently, Rhinacanthus nasutus plant was evaluated for its use to cure fungal and herpes virus infections. Lignans, isolated from the roots of this plant, demonstrated antiviral activities. The compounds were studied and reported to have antiviral activity against PR8 influenza virus strain, Coxsackie virus, and human rhinovirus 1B virus (Ngoc et al. 2019). A Chinese herb, Radix isatidis has been used for treating several viral diseases, such as influenza virus, HSV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mumps virus, coxsackie virus, and hepatitis B virus. Hui et al. (2019) reported the significant antiviral activity of lignans isolated from this plant. The mechanism hypothesized was that the lignans present in the plant can target adsorption and replication of RSV (Hui et al. 2019). Similarly, lignan glycosides isolated from the fruit of Forsythia suspense were established to possess anti-influenza A (H5N1) activity as revealed by in vitro studies (Li et al. 2019).\",\r\n        \"Coumarins belong to the benzopyrones family of phytochemicals and were initially found in the plant Dipteryx odorata. These phytochemicals are in medicinal uses, since a long time in many forms of the traditional medicines across the globe (Matos et al. 2015; Bahadori et al. 2016). As reported by Bahadori and co-workers, Simaroubaceae family members have been observed to contain coumarin as a significant phytochemical, and this phytochemical is demonstrated to be biologically active in inhibiting HIV (Bahadori et al. 2016). In another experiment, Mammea americana and Tabernaemontana cymosa were evaluated for their phytochemicals and antiviral activities. M. americana was reported with two types of coumarin compounds (i.e., 34SK001 and 34SK002) obtained after column chromatography and has antiviral property. The experiments done by the group of scientist included various strategies, including inhibition assays for dengue as well as chikungunya virus. According to them, almost 100% inhibition was obtained in vitro by these two coumarins for dengue and chikungunya virus (Gomez-Calderón et al. 2017). Moreover, the medicinal plants aiding the protection against or treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus were tested for the presence of coumarins by Rohini and Padmini (2016). According to them, hexane extract of Andrographis paniculata contained coumarins. Additionally, ethyl acetate extract of Santalum album was shown to have small quantities of coumarins, whereas ethanolic extract showed a slight presence of coumarin in plants A. paniculata, Trichosanthes dioica, Chrysopogon zizanioides, and S. album. As these medicinal plants and their preparations are effective in inhibiting the viral growth, especially due to the occurrence of coumarins, they are commonly used in the treatment of dengue and chikungunya viruses (Rohini and Padmini 2016). An experiment was performed to understand the phytochemical analysis of medicinal plant, Morinda citrifolia, which has been known to exhibit antiviral properties. The bark extracts of the plant were researched for phytochemicals, and the extracted compounds were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to identify the presence of coumarins (Wang et al. 2016). They also predicted that a very significant amount of coumarins in the extract could be involved in the inhibition of H1N1 virus (Wang et al. 2013).\",\r\n        \"Recently, Hu et al. (2019) designed 24 coumarin derivatives and observed for their activity against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Among all of them, only one coumarin (C4) significantly suppressed IHNV infection by inhibiting apoptosis and causing cellular damages. Hence, it could be the potential lead for the development of anti-IHNV vaccine/drug (Hu et al. 2019).\",\r\n        \"The World Intellectual Property Organization Patent Application (WIPO), with a patent application number of WO2017069661A1 assigned to a limited liability company, claims the antiviral activity of pyrimidyl-di(diazaspiro-alkanes) against herpes virus, HIV, papillomavirus, and hepatitis virus. The US patents US9491193B2 and US 9481630 assigned to Korea Research Institute of Bioscience claim the phorbol-type diterpene compound and ingenane-type diterpene compound, respectively, to show antiviral activity by inhibiting viral replication. Likewise, WO20091589A1, another patent assigned to Instytut Medycyny Doswiadczalnej I Klinicznej PAN, claims the preparations of Viburnum opulus fruit in the prevention and therapy of HSV infections. This preparation claims the use of active ingredients in ointments or creams for external use as well as an active ingredient of pills for oral administration. Another patent, US20170333390A1, assigned to Commission on Higher Education, Chiang Mai University, claims xanthones in combination with sesamin possess anti-inflammatory, anti-cytokine storm, and antiviral activity (against anti-influenza). The patented phytochemicals are listed in Table 2.\",\r\n        \"Traditional plants have been continuously used in the field of medicine for the treatment of various infections. Therapies based on natural products (phytochemicals) for human health are associated with less toxicity and minimal side effects. Thus, the researchers are focusing to elucidate the new plant-based compounds for the treatment of many diseases. Different plant secondary metabolites have been studied and used for various human-based treatments because of antioxidant, anticancerous, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Several in silico and in vitro studies have revealed the promising use of photochemicals for the treatment of viral infections. Among all the phytochemicals, flavonoids have been widely exploited and studied for the treatment of several viral diseases. Furthermore, some of the flavonoids exhibited good antiviral activity against influenza, dengue, chikungunya, and many more viruses and can be a potential candidate which can be processed further to the development of antivirals. Other phytochemicals like terpenoids and alkaloids also showed effective activity against viral diseases. Moreover, the combination of phytochemicals with the different compounds either with any synthetic compound or any drug can be also a new, potential approach to find the good antiviral therapies. Along with this, the dose of phytochemicals and the mechanism behind it to inhibit viral infections needs to be further determined which is very essential for the development of effective and potential antiviral drug.\",\r\n        \"Antiviral therapies for the life-threatening viral diseases are generally expensive and have adverse side effects. Even some of the viral diseases do not have any antiviral treatments like chikungunya virus and HIV. In the realm of the therapeutics, there is an urgent need of effective, safe, and inexpensive antiviral therapies/drugs/inhibitors with minimal side effects to the mankind. Therefore, the approach using the phytochemical could be the better option in the development of antivirals. Synergistic studies employing phytochemicals in combination with either already FDA-approved drugs or inhibitors could be explored in the future for better and long-term efficacy of antiviral. Moreover, repurposing of already reported phytochemical as an inhibitor for viral diseases could be done in search of potential antivirals. Phytochemicals having antiviral activity can be nanoencapsulated for better delivery, prolonged action, and enhanced bioavailability.
