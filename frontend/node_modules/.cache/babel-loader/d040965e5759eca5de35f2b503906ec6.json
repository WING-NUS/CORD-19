treatment for HIV infection. The drug combinations used in this setting normally consist of several inhibitors that target different enzymes in the viral life-cycle, including reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Although HAART can dramatically decrease the levels of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, the emergence of drug resistance is usually unavoidable because of the high mutation and rapid replication rates of the virus. The sequential administration of different drugs is therefore required for the treatment of HIV infection, as well as the development of new targeted therapies [1]. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is an important choice for the treatment of patients who have not responded well to HAART. In contrast to traditional small-molecule enzyme inhibitors, ENF is a 36-residue peptide that binds to the viral envelope gp41 protein and inhibits the gp41-mediated membrane fusion between the virus and the host-cell, which is an essential step for the delivery of the viral genome into the cell [2]. ENF has been successfully used in clinic practice to control HIV infection and transmission. However, as is the case with many peptide and protein drugs [3], ENF exhibits poor aqueous solubility and can be rapidly removed from systemic circulation through metabolic pathways and immune response systems. To maintain an efficacious concentration, ENF must be administered twice daily at a high dosage (90 mg) by subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, ENF therapy must be implemented consistently over an extended period of time because of the chronic nature of HIV infection [4], which can lead to severe injection-site reactions [5]. ENF treatment is therefore inconvenient to the patient and represents an expensive regimen for the health care provider, and these factors have severely limited its application in the clinic.\", \"A number of different approaches have been developed to address the pharmacokinetic problems associated with ENF and several other peptide analogues, which can inhibit HIV fusion in a similar manner. Peptide engineering strategies, such as the incorporation of salt bridges, can lead to increases in the in vivo stability of a peptide sequence, which can result in extended half-lives [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The chemical modification of a peptide with a synthetic or natural molecule, such as cholesterol [11] or albumin [12], [13], can also lead to a reduction in its immunogenicity and proteolysis [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation is a commonly used method for improving the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic peptides and proteins [21], [22], [23], and this method has been applied to a peptide inhibitor of HIV fusion that overlaps ENF by 33 residues [19]. The PEGylated peptide showed a 3.4-fold increase in the half-life against tryptic degradation, although there was a slight decrease in the fusion-inhibitory potency when compared with the unmodified peptide. Despite the positive results reported in this study for the PEGylation of the inhibitor, there have been no reports in the literature to date pertaining to the antiviral activity or the pharmacokinetic properties of a fusion inhibitor conjugated with PEG.\", \"As part of our ongoing research towards the development of persistent inhibitors against HIV fusion, we previously developed a series of glycosylated ENFs with long in vivo half-lives that completely retained their antiviral activities [20]. In a similar manner to PEGylation, the glycosylation of peptides and proteins leads to an increase in their molecular size and steric bulk, which can have a significant impact on their biophysical and physiological properties. However, current techniques for the construction of glycopeptides and glycoproteins are quite challenging. Recombinant expression systems allow for the rapid and large-scale production of glycopeptides and glycoproteins, but these systems provided only limited control over the glycosylation step [24]. Chemical and chemoenzymatic syntheses can produce structurally well-defined molecules [25], [26], but generally require multiple steps and tedious purification procedures that can result in low production yields, thereby limiting their practical application.\", \"Based on our previous experience of the glycosylation of ENF [20], and the fact that PEGylation has advanced many bioactive proteins and peptides into clinical applications [23], we sought to prepare the ENF−PEG (EP) conjugate as a simple alternative. By controlling the modification site of ENF and the molecular weight (MW) of PEG, we successfully synthesized an EP conjugate with a remarkably improved pharmacokinetic profile. This conjugate formed a strong binding interaction with a functional fragment of the gp41 protein and exhibited potent inhibitory activities towards various HIV isolates that are currently in circulation, with in vitro efficacies comparable to that of ENF. It is therefore envisaged that the results presented in this study will provide a basis for the development of further EP conjugates as long-lasting HIV fusion inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection.\", \"Following our established glycosylation strategy [20], we investigated the site-specific addition of PEG to the terminus of ENF using a thiol-maleimide coupling reaction (Fig. 1\\n). Two ENF derivatives bearing a single cysteine residue at their N- or C-termini (cENF and ENFc) were modified with methoxy-PEG-maleimides (mPEG-MAL) of 2 and 5 kDa. These reactions proceeded smoothly under near-physiological conditions to give the corresponding EP conjugates bearing the fully intact ENF sequence. The conjugates were purified by preparative HPLC, followed by the lyophilization of the resulting residues to give the desired products as white powders in 82–90% yields (purity >95%). The subsequent characterization of the conjugates by MALDI-TOF MS revealed a single defined attachment of PEG to the peptide backbone. As expected, all of the conjugates were highly soluble in water (≥3 mg/mL) as opposed to ENF, which has negligible aqueous solubility.\", \"To ensure that the modified ENF retained its binding affinity for the HIV gp41 protein, we measured the strength of the binding interaction between the conjugates and a functional fragment of gp41 known as N46, which contains the full binding region for ENF and has been used as a suitable model for the investigations of HIV fusion inhibitors [27], [28], [29]. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed that all the conjugates strongly bound to N46 with affinities (K\\nd) in the range of 307–1410 nM (Fig. 2\\n). Although the affinities of the conjugates were lower than that of ENF (182 nM), we observed a general trend towards increasing affinity as the MW of the PEG portion of the conjugate decreased. Particularly, the PEG2k-ENF demonstrated an affinity (307 nM) approximating to that of ENF. In contrast, none of the EP conjugates or ENF bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA), confirming that the observed interactions were specific for peptide N46. The SPR experiments measured the binding of ENF or EP conjugates to the chip-immobilized N46, and the assay condition did not exactly match with the membrane environment necessary for the fusion inhibition. However, the potent interaction between EP conjugates and N46 confirmed in this assay suggested that the attached PEG had no significant impact on the intrinsic binding affinity of ENF.\", \"Peptide conformation can have a remarkable effect on the antiviral activity of fusion inhibitors [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. ENF lacks a defined structure in solution, where it has a low α-helicity. In contrast, N46 adopts a typical α-helical conformation in solution, and its α-helicity is reduced dramatically upon its binding to ENF. The ENF and EP conjugates prepared in this study were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD), and the results revealed that the low α-helical content of ENF was further decreased by the attached PEG in a MW-dependent manner (Fig. 3\\nA). Interestingly, all of the conjugates interacted with N46 to form stable α-helical complexes, which had markedly higher α-helicities than that of N46 alone or in complex with ENF (Fig. 3B). This result is, however, inconsistent with the affinity of the conjugates for N46 which is obviously lower than that of ENF, as the α-helicity of binding complexes is positively correlated to their stability [28], [29]. The apparent contradiction between the affinity and the α-helicity likely resulted from the different assay formats. Unlike the chip-based SPR assay in which N46 was immobilized on a solid surface, in CD experiment free N46 and the EP conjugate in solution were able to partake in a dynamic binding process that allowed the attached PEG to interact with the binding complex and the aqueous medium. The mechanism of the improvement in the α-helicity of the complex following PEGylation has not yet been determined. However, the ability of the attached PEG to form an amphiphilic shell capable of stabilizing the coiled-coil peptide core under aqueous conditions [36], [37], [38], may provide some evidence in support of our results.\", \"Having established that the EP conjugates could bind to the gp41 fragment to form high affinity complexes with high α-helicities, we examined their antiviral activities against a laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain SF33. The replication of the virus in TZM-bl cells [39] was measured in the presence of the conjugates, with ENF as a control (Table 1\\n). ENF and all of the conjugates inhibited the replication of HIV at nanomolar concentrations, with no cytotoxicity observed below the micromolar range (CC50 > 100 μM), as determined using an XTT assay [41]. The two conjugates bearing the smaller PEG (2 kDa) showed higher activities than their 5 kDa counterparts. The N-terminally PEGylated peptides showed much greater activity than their C-terminal congeners, with the PEG2k-ENF exhibiting the highest inhibitory activity of all the conjugates. Notably, the EC50 value of PEG2k-ENF (4 nM) was comparable to that of ENF (3 nM). The chemical modification at the C-terminus of ENF has an adverse impact on its antiviral activity [11], [12], [20], because the lipophilic residues (WNWF) in this region are required for the anchoring of the peptide into the membrane interface where the fusion occurs [28], [29]. Our data were therefore in agreement with these earlier findings and revealed that the attachment of PEG2k to the N-terminus of ENF did not lead to a significant decrease in its antiviral efficacy.\", \"We next analyzed the pharmacokinetics of PEG2k-ENF in rats following the subcutaneous injection of a single dose of this material (Fig. 4\\n). In contrast to ENF, which was both rapidly adsorbed and rapidly cleared from systemic circulation, the EP conjugate showed a slower but more sustained release profile from the injection site. The calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters using the well-established non-compartmental method [44] revealed that the conjugate had an elimination half-life [45] (T\\n1/2) which was over 10-fold longer than that of ENF. The overall pharmacokinetic profile of PEG2k-ENF was also superior to that of ENF, with marked increases in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), apparent volume of distribution (V\\nd), and mean residence time (MRT), as well as a marked decrease in systematic clearance rate (CL). This improvement in pharmacokinetic profile, as generally seen for many other PEGylated protein or peptide therapeutics [21], [22], [23], makes the EP conjugate attractive as a long-lasting fusion inhibitor to address the unmet medical needs associated with the treatment of HIV infection.\", \"To further evaluate the therapeutic potential of PEG2k-ENF, we examined its antiviral spectrum using fourteen HIV-1 viruses of different subtypes, including five B′ (also known as Thai B), five BC, and four AE isolates, all of which represent the predominant strains currently circulating in China [46], [47], [48], [49]. The PEG2k-ENF inhibited the replication of these viruses in TZM-bl cells as efficacious as ENF, with activities (EC50) in the low-nanomolar range (Table 2\\n) and selectivity indices (SI) greater than 1000. Taken together with its remarkably improved pharmacokinetic properties, the broad and potent antiviral activities of PEG2k-ENF show that the EP conjugates warrant further preclinical and clinical evaluations.\", \"We have demonstrated that the site-specific PEGylation of ENF improved its pharmacokinetic profile without discernible decrease in its antiviral activity. The coupling of cENF to mPEG-MAL through a concise thiol-maleimide reaction allowed for the large-scale synthesis of the EP conjugate, which could be important for clinical applications that require a sufficient supply of material. The EP conjugate exhibited much better aqueous solubility and in vivo half-life than ENF, which could lead to less-frequent dosing regimens and a reduction in adverse injection-site reactions. In addition, the EP conjugate displayed potent inhibitory activity towards the most common primary HIV strains circulating in China, further highlighting its potential as an effective and long-acting inhibitor of HIV fusion. It is noteworthy that a number of other enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have similar mechanisms of virus−cell fusion to that observed in HIV infection. With this in mind, it is envisaged that the peptide inhibitors currently under investigation against these viruses [50], [51], [52], [53] could also be subjected to the PEGylation approach described in this study.\", \"All peptides used in this study were synthesized using a solid-phase Fmoc method at Beijing Scilight Biotechnology LLC (Beijing, China), purified by HPLC (purity >95%), and characterized by MALDI−TOF MS. The sources of HIV-1SF33 and TZM-bl, as well as the methods used for their preservation and passage have been described previously [20], [41]. The clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtypes B′, BC, and AE were obtained from treatment-naive patients and stored at our laboratory in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [46], [47]. These viruses represent the predominant strains circulating in China from 2005 to 2008. Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 7 weeks old, and 150–180 g) were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China) and fed for 2 days before being used for pharmacokinetic analysis. mPEG-MAL (2 and 5 kDa) was purchased from Beijing Kaizheng Biotech Development (Beijing, China). All of the other chemicals used in this study were purchased as the analytical grade from various commercial sources. HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent 1200 system (Agilent, USA) equipped with a UV detector. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). All experiments with the viruses were performed in an approved biosafety level (BSL-3) containment laboratory.\", \"An aqueous solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate (5 mM) was added in a dropwise manner to a stirred mixture of cysteine-incorporated ENF (cENF or ENFc, 10 mg, 2 μmol) and mPEG-MAL (2 or 5 kDa, 2 equiv) in a sodium phosphate buffer (5 mL, 5 mM, pH 7.5) to adjust the pH of the mixture to 7.2. The resulting mixture was then stirred for 10 min at rt before being directly purified by preparative HPLC to afford PEG2k-ENF (12 mg, 90%), ENF-PEG2k (11 mg, 85%), PEG5k-ENF (15 mg, 82%), or ENF-PEG5k (15 mg, 82%) as a white powder. The HPLC chromatographic conditions are provided in Fig. 1.\", \"The binding affinities of EP conjugates to peptide N46 were analyzed by a Biacore biosensor system (Biacore 3000, Biacore Co., Ltd, Sweden), using a previously described procedure [20]. Briefly, N46 was immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran-coated sensor chip (CM-5, research grade) using a standard primary amine-coupling protocol. Solutions of EP conjugates in PBS containing Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) at different concentrations (0.125–4 μM) were then flowed over the surface of the sensor at a rate of 20 μl/min, and the responses were recorded. ENF was used as a positive control instead of EP conjugate. BSA was used as a negative control instead of peptide N46. The binding kinetic parameters were calculated using the Biacore evaluation software (version 4.1), and the results are shown in Table S1.\", \"The secondary structures of ENF and EP conjugates were analyzed both in the absence and the presence of peptide N46 using a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK). Measurements were conducted using solutions of the peptides in PBS (5 mM, pH 7.2) as described previously [20]. A concentration of 35 μM was used for both ENF/EP conjugates and peptide N46.\", \"The antiviral activities of ENF and EP conjugates against both the laboratory-adapted HIV-1SF33 and the clinical HIV-1 isolates (subtypes B′, BC, and AE) were determined in TZM-bl cell cultures, as described previously [20], [46]. Briefly, TZM-bl cells grown on a tissue culture plate (104/well) were inoculated with 200 TCID50 of the virus in the presence and absence of ENF or an EP conjugate (100 μL, in DMEM, at different concentrations from 1.2 to 1000 nM). After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, the cells (100 μL) were harvested and lysed using a lysing reagent (100 μL, Promega). The activity of the luciferase expressed by TZM-bl cells was then measured, and the EC50 and EC90 values were calculated using the Reed and Muench method [40] based on the percentage inhibition of the luciferase activity.\", \"The cytotoxicity of EP conjugates was measured in TZM-bl cells following a standard XTT assay protocol [20], [41], [54].\", \"Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4) were given a single subcutaneous injection of ENF or PEG2k-ENF at a dosage of 1.7 μmol/kg (in physiological saline). The collection and processing of blood sample, the determination of peptide concentration, and the evaluation of pharmacokinetics were performed as described previously [20]. A known HPLC method [42], [43] was used to identify the plasma concentrations of ENF and PEG2k-ENF. The HPLC conditions were as follows: Waters RP-HPLC column (XSELECT CSH C18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, Waters), 30 → 52% CH3CN/H2O (containing 0.1 v/v% TFA) gradient at 0.6–1.2 mL/min, UV detection at 220 nm.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27240277/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.05.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523416304159; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523416304159\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7117417\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.02.026\",\n  title: \"Isolation of a novel viral agent associated with porcine reproductive and neurological syndrome and reproduction of the disease\",\n  doc_date: \"2008-09-18\",\n  authors: [\"Roman.Pogranichniy\", \"Kent.Schwartz\", \"Kyoung-Jin.Yoon\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Case definition ::: Materials and methods\", \"Biological samples ::: Materials and methods\", \"Biological samples ::: Materials and methods\", \"Immunofluorescence microscopy on frozen tissue sections ::: Materials and methods\", \"Polymerase chain reaction assays ::: Materials and methods\", \"Virus isolation attempts ::: Materials and methods\", \"Virus isolation attempts ::: Materials and methods\", \"Virus isolation attempts ::: Materials and methods\", \"Virus isolation attempts ::: Materials and methods\", \"Electron microscopy ::: Materials and methods\", \"Electron microscopy ::: Materials and methods\", \"Effect of DNA inhibitors on virus growth ::: Materials and methods\", \"Inoculation of pregnant sows at 30 days of gestation ::: Animal inoculation studies ::: Materials and methods\", \"Inoculation of CDCD pigs ::: Animal inoculation studies ::: Materials and methods\", \"Histopathology ::: Materials and methods\", \"Pathological evaluation of clinical cases ::: Results\", \"Pathological evaluation of clinical cases ::: Results\", \"Isolation and preliminary characterization of virus isolates ::: Results\", \"Isolation and preliminary characterization of virus isolates ::: Results\", \"Isolation and preliminary characterization of virus isolates ::: Results\", \"Isolation and preliminary characterization of virus isolates ::: Results\", \"Sow study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"Sow study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"Sow study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"CDCD pig study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"CDCD pig study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"CDCD pig study ::: Outcome of experimental inoculation ::: Results\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Wastage of pigs due to reproductive failure results in significant economic losses to the swine industry. Death losses of sexually mature breeding animals and market hogs add more economic burden to producers. In many situations, both infectious and non-infectious causes can account for reproductive problems and mortality; infectious diseases are considerably more important because of the rapid transmission between animals and many times the lack of effective preventive measures.\", \"Since at least 1995, pork producers and swine practitioners have reported disease outbreaks characterized primarily by early infertility, hence commonly referred to as “sow infertility syndrome” or “growth depression syndrome” (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Typically, producers have observed an acute decline in farrowing rate due to increased early or delayed returns followed by a prolonged period (up to 2 years) of sub-optimal farrowing performance. Loss of pregnancy most commonly occurs in the early stages of gestation (i.e., 30–55 days), although abortion and reproductive failure were reported on sows at later gestations. Affected animals which were confirmed pregnant at 30 days either aborted or demonstrated irregular return to estrus. Besides reproductive disorder, many of the affected animals were presented with neurological signs, such as posterior weakness/paralysis, ataxia, bar chewing, and head pressing/banging (Yoon, 2003). The neurologic symptoms in affected individuals progressed, with death in 2 or 3 days as the usual outcome. Central nervous signs were also observed in younger pigs such as nursery and fattening pigs. To reflect various clinical manifestations, the newly identified disease has also been commonly referred to as “Porcine Reproductive and Neurologic Syndrome (PRNS)”. Reproductive and neurologic problems were not, however, always present simultaneously.\", \"The incidence of the problem seems to continue growing. The pattern of spread within and between herds implies the involvement of an infectious agent. To date, affected herds have been observed in both PRRSV-infected and PRRSV-free swine herds in many states including Iowa (Yoon, 2003). Although many cases with similar clinical presentations have been presented to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL), a conclusive diagnosis could not be reached to date (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Laboratory testing including serology, has not yet demonstrated the role of any recognized reproductive or neurologic pathogens of swine associated with the symptoms described above, including foreign or exotic viral agents. No bacterial or viral pathogens were consistently identified in index cases. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the condition is toxin-related, or associated with any particular management practice or pig genotype. Therefore, the disease was thought to be due to a previously unrecognized agent. With that hypothesis, the following extensive laboratory diagnostic investigations were conducted to identify the causative agent.\", \"Index animals were selected for diagnostic investigations from herds showing the following clinical presentations: Sows exhibiting an unusually high early return or abortion after 30 but before 50 days of gestation; animals that were lethargic, restless, and/or dyspneic particularly after exercise prior to losing the pregnancy; some of the affected animals were also febrile and pale. Besides reproductive failure, some of the affected pregnant sows and weaned pigs also showed neurological signs such as posterior weakness, paresis, ataxia, lameness, head pressing or banging and aggressive behavior often leading to abrasions on the forehead, nose and front legs as well as abortion. Neonates showed “shaking” and many times appeared to be blind as those animals could not walk in one direction. Central nervous signs were also observed in grower-finishers. Some pigs recovered but the majority of affected animals died within several days of showing clinical signs. Sometimes affected animals died suddenly without any overt proceeding clinical signs. To avoid any potential confusion, animals from known PRRS-positive herds were not included in the study.\", \"Serum, whole blood and tissues (brain, secondary lymphoid tissues, kidney, liver) were collected from each animal and used for laboratory testing. Secondary lymphoid tissues included tonsil, regional lymph nodes and spleen. When available, fetal thoracic fluid and tissues were collected from aborted or freshly dead fetuses. Placenta and uterus were also collected from sows.\", \"Buffy coat cells were fractionated from EDTA blood by gradient centrifugation and used for testing. Sera and fetal thoracic fluids were tested as collected. Tissues were tested after 20% (w/v) homogenate was made in Earle's balanced salt solution (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and filter-sterilized through 0.22-μm membrane filters (Fisher Scientific Co, Houston, TX, USA).\", \"The FA test was performed on cryosections of brain, tonsil, kidney and lymph nodes from clinically affected animals submitted to ISU-VDL to detect viral antigens. Sections were attached to prepared glass slides and fixed by immersing in cold 100% cold acetone. Fixed tissue sections were then stained with many FA conjugates against different viruses. Fixed tissues were also stained with commercially obtained polyclonal antiserum for ruminant/caprine pestivirus antibodies (440-BDV 9001) from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, IA, USA). The bovine serum was diluted 1:80 in the 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 for tissue material from sows. Slides flooded with the antibodies were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humid condition and then rinsed with PBS three times. The antigen–antibody reaction in tissues was visualized by staining tissue sections with optimally diluted goat anti-bovine IgG (H+L) conjugated with FITC (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Swine sera collected from naturally or experimentally infected pigs were used in the same manner but FITC-labeled anti-porcine IgG (H+L) was used instead of anti-bovine conjugate. Slides were then observed under a fluorescence microscope.\", \"All clinical specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests for known swine viral pathogens, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) of European and North American genotypes (type 1 and 2, respectively), porcine circovirus (PCV) type 1 and 2, group 1–3 porcine enterovirus (PEV) (currently group 1 and 2 PEV are classified into porcine teschovirus, whereas group 3 remains as enterovirus), influenza A virus, porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reovirus type 1, 2 and 3, porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Japanese encephalitis B virus (JEV), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) type 1, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus type 1 (PLHV-1), swine hepatitis E virus (sHEV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), West Nile virus (WNV), members of genus Pestivirus, and members of alpha Togavirus. A multiplex PCR was used for detecting PCV DNA as previously described (Pogranichnyy et al., 2000). A PCR assays previously described (Ellis et al., 1999) was employed for detecting PPV DNA. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays were used for detecting RNA of PRRSV (Yoon et al., 1999), group 1–3 PEV (Zell et al., 2000), CSFV (Wirz et al., 1993, Hofmann et al., 1994), BVDV (Ridpath and Bolin, 1998, Vilcek et al., 1994), JEV and WNV (Scaramozzino et al., 2001), PERV (Akiyoshi et al., 1998), and alpha-togaviruses (Powers et al., 2001). Detection of SIV or TGEV/PRCV genome in samples was attempted using multiplex RT-PCR assays established in ISU-VDL (Harmon and Yoon, 1999).\", \"Virus isolation was attempted on all samples using various cell lines and primary cells of porcine origin. All cell lines and primary cells were confirmed by virus isolation technique, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay and antigen-capturing ELISA (Syracuse Bioanalytical, Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA) to be free of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) prior to and during use. All cell lines were also confirmed by a commercial PCR test (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) to be free of Mycoplasma spp.\", \"Cells were prepared in 48-well plates and 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Mediatech, Inc., Herdon, VA, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) BVDV-free fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or 5% (v/v) horse serum (Sigma Chemical Co.), 20 mM l-glutamine (Gibco/BRL Life Science, Grand Island, NY, USA), and an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma Chemical Co.). After the confluent monolayer was formed, samples (0.25 ml/well and 1ml/flask) were inoculated into each flask in duplicate or triplicate. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were rinsed with fresh growth medium and were incubated further in a humid 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 supply. Alternatively, samples were inoculated in cell suspension and left for 24 h before material was removed. Inoculated cells were then observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) until 7 days post inoculation (PI). When CPE was evident in more than 70% of cell monolayer, cell culture medium was harvested and inoculated onto freshly prepared cells in duplicate. For cases in which no CPE was evident by 7 days PI, cells were subjected to 2 cycles of freeze thawing at −70 °C and 35 °C, respectively, and then cell lysate was inoculated into freshly prepared cells in the same manner as above.\", \"At day 2 to 4 PI, regardless of the presence or absence of CPE, one set of the inoculated cells was fixed, after cell culture media were harvested, by immerging them in cold 80% aqueous acetone and subjected for an immunofluorescence microscopy using fluorescent isothiocynate (FITC)-labeled antibodies (USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Ames, IA, USA; Rural Technologies, Inc., Brookings, SD, USA; DBA American Bioresearch, Inc., Seymour, TN, USA) raised against known swine viral pathogens, such as PRRSV type 1 and 2, PRV, PCMV, PCV (type 1 and 2), PPV, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), PEV, TGEV, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), swine influenza virus (SIV) of H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, influenza A virus, porcine reovirus, rabies virus and pestiviruses (BVDV/BDV). In addition, the cells were reacted with sera collected from animals affected but surviving during the course of natural infection. For pig and bovine sera, anti-porcine IgG (H+L) and anti-bovine IgG (H+L) conjugated with FITC (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc.) were used as secondary antibody to visualize specific antigen–antibody complex. At the same time another set of the inoculated cells was subjected to freeze thawing and then cell lysates were tested by PCR assays for known swine viral pathogens described above under PCR.\", \"Each cell culture fluid and corresponding unused cell lysates that were negative for all viral agents described above were combined for each sample and inoculated again on each cell for further propagation for use in other laboratory testing such as electron microscopy (EM) or animal studies.\", \"To assess morphological characteristic of the viral isolate, cells inoculated with potential virus material and cell culture fluid containing the virus as well as pig tissues were examined by electron microscopic techniques. Cells inoculated with virus material and tissues were examined by thin-section positive-staining EM. Inoculated cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere for up to 120 h PI. At between 48 and 120 h PI, the cells were harvested using a cell scraper and pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. Each cell pellet was fixed in 2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.05M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for 48 h at 4 °C. Samples were rinsed once in PBS followed by 2 washes in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxidate in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at ambient temperature. The samples then were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared with ultra pure acetone, infiltrated and embedded using a modified EPON epoxy resin (Embed 812, Electron Microscopy Science, Fort Washington, PA, USA). Resin blocks were polymerized for 48 h at 70 °C. Thick and ultra-thin sections were made using a Reichert Ultracut S ultra microtome (Leeds Precision Instruments, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Ultra-thin sections were collected onto copper grids and counterstained with 5% uranyl acetate in 100% methanol for 15 min followed by Sato's lead stain for 10 min. Images were captured using a JEOL 1200EX scanning and transmission electron microscope (Japan Electro Optic Laboratories, Akishima, Japan).\", \"Viruses in cell culture fluid were examined by a negative-staining EM as previously described (Hsiung, 1982). Viral particles were pelleted by centrifugation using SW41 rotor in an ultracentrifuge (Optima LE 80K; Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA) for 3 h at 160,000 × \\ng and resuspended in a small quantity of PBS. Ten microliters of the virus suspension were applied to the carbon-coated grid. Excessive PBS was dried out with an absorbent paper and stained with 4% potassium phosphotungstate acid (PTA) for 5 min at ambient temperature. Grids were then examined under an electron microscope and digital images of virions were captured using a JEOL 1200EX scanning and transmission electron microscope (Japan Electro Optic Laboratories).\", \"Mitomycin C and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BUDR) are known to inhibit the replication of DNA viruses in cells. To determine if Virus X contains a DNA genome, virus titration was performed using a microtitration infectivity assay in the presence and absence of these chemicals as previously described (Benfield et al., 1992). In brief, confluent monolayer of CL ISUVDL33 and CL ISUVDL99 cells were prepared in 96-well plates and inoculated with virus suspensions (100 μl/well) which were prepared by a serial 10-fold dilution technique. After 1-hr of absorption at 37 °C, the virus inoculum was removed and cells replenished with MEM supplemented with 40 or 160 μg/ml of BUDR (Sigma Chemical Co.) or 2 or 20 μg/ml of mitomycin C (Sigma Chemical Co.). Plates were incubated for an additional 48 h; virus titer was determined by the presence of visible CPE and then confirmed by IFA staining using rabbit antiserum raised against virus isolate designated ISUYP604671 from a PRNS case. As controls for RNA and DNA viruses, PRRSV and PRV, respectively were concurrently titrated under the same conditions described above.\", \"Seven sows at 4th or 5th parity were purchased from a high-health-status commercial vendor and transferred to an animal holding facility with farrowing crates and bred through artificial insemination. The facility was operated and managed at BSL2 compliance. Once pregnancy was confirmed by an ultrasound technique, 5 sows were selected and used for the study. Four of the 5 sows at 30 days of gestation were inoculated intranasally, subcutaneously and intramuscularly with one of the following biological materials: (a) cell culture fluid containing virus isolate designated ISUYP604671; (b) homogenate of tissues collected from a clinically affected sow; (c) serum collected from the clinically affected sow. All inoculated animals were kept in the same room but individually in farrowing crates for 30 days. The one remaining sows served as sham-inoculated control and was kept in a separate room. After inoculation, all animals were monitored for changes in behavior and any reproductive problems. In addition, the sows were bled every seven days. At the termination of the study, all sows were euthanized, and various tissues (brain, tonsil, lung, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver, placenta, spinal cord, uterus, uterine fluid) and, if present, fetuses were collected from each sow for histopathology, virus isolation and/or serology.\", \"Seven 7-week-old caesarian-derived-colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs were used to evaluate the clinical effect of Virus X on young swine. Animals were divided to 3 groups. Group 1 (n\\n = 3) was inoculated with cell culture material containing Virus X (ISUYP604671) via intranasal, intramuscular and intravenous routes. Group 2 (n\\n = 3) was inoculated via the same routes with serum from an animal (Sow 800) which was experimentally infected with the virus in the previous animal study. Group 3 (n\\n = 1) was inoculated with virus-free cell culture fluid and served as sham-inoculated negative control. All animals were monitored for the first 2 weeks after inoculation for changes in rectal temperature and behavior and for clinical signs. One pig per group except group 3 was euthanized and necropsied on days 7, 10 and 14 PI. Tissues (brain, tonsil, lung, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes) were collected from each pig for both virus assays and histopathology. Animals were bled at days 0, 7, 10 and 14 PI to collect whole blood and serum. At day 14 PI all remaining animals were euthanized and necropsied.\", \"Tissues were fixed by immersing in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after collection. Fixed tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned according to the standard protocol established at ISU-VDL. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination.\", \"In many cases, external examination revealed trauma to the face and head of clinically affected pigs probably as a result of head-banging and head-pressing behaviors. Traumatic lesions were also seen in the extremities or shoulders possibly due to ataxia or recumbency.\", \"While affected animals showed distinct clinical signs, gross lesions were not present except for the presence of petichial hemorrhage in lymph nodes and sometimes on the serosa of many organs. Microscopically, some lesions limited to the brain were detected as mild focal to locally extensive nonsuppurative perivascular cuffing, gliosis, and lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis. Hepatitis and interstitial pneumonia were other lesions frequently observed in the affected animals.\", \"A cytopathic agent that could pass through a 0.22 μm membrane filter was repeatedly and consistently isolated from serum, tonsil, lymph nodes and/or brain from clinically affected animals. Because of its unknown identity, the agent was tentatively named “Virus X”. Two initial isolates were designated ISU-KJY96 and ISUYP604671, respectively. Besides Virus X, several other viruses, such as PEV, porcine reovirus and PRRSV, were also inconsistently and infrequently isolated from suspect animals.\", \"Morphologically, Virus X was an enveloped virus with the size of approximately 50–55 nm in diameter. As shown in Fig. 1\\n, the virion contains an icosahedral core and acquires its envelope by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. Overall, Virus X resembles members of the family Arteriviridae, Flaviviridae or Togaviridae.\", \"As summarized in Table 1\\n, infection and replication of the virus ISUYP604671, like PRRSV, was not negatively affected by the presence of BUDR and mitomycin C in cell culture media, whereas PRV replication was substantially inhibited by the treatment.\", \"Various cell lines and primary cells of porcine origin were permissive to Virus X and supported productive infection of the virus (Fig. 2\\n). On immunofluorescence tests, Virus X did not cross-react with antibodies raised against PRRSV (type 1 and 2), PRV, SIV (both H1 and H3), TGEV, PPV, PCV (type 1 and 2), porcine reovirus, EMCV, PEV, HEV, PCMV and rabies virus. Interestingly, the virus appeared to be recognized to a degree by the polyclonal antiserum specific for BVDV as weak positive fluorescence was observed when Virus X infected cells were stained with the serum (Fig. 3\\n). However, PCR results for 5′UTR did not support that Virus X was BVDV (both type 1 and 2) or CSFV. PCR assays also demonstrated that Virus X was not PRRSV (neither North American nor European genotypes), PCV (neither type 1 nor 2), PEV (groups 1, 2 and 3), influenza A virus, TGEV, PRCV, PEDV, PPV, sHEV, WNV, JEV, PERV, PLHV-1 or alpha-togaviruses.\", \"Clinical, pathological and virological observations on pregnant sows after experimental inoculation are summarized in Table 2\\n. During a 30-day observation period, inoculated sows became viremic. Yet, all animals remained normal in their behavior during the study period. No abortion was observed in any of the inoculated sows.\", \"At the termination of the study, no lesions were observed in the control sow. In contrast, gross lesions, such as hemorrhages in inguinal lymph node and decolorization of the uterus (green and brown), were observed in the sows inoculated with materials containing Virus X (ISUYP604671). Embryonic or fetal death was also apparent in some of the inoculated sows. One of the 4 inoculated sows did not have any fetus at necropsy although no significant lesions were observed. Microscopically, necrotic edema in the lymph node, mineralization plaques in uterus and necrotic debris in the lumen of the uterus were observed, supporting the possibility of embryonic death and/or fetal reabsorption.\", \"Virus X was recovered from tissues (spleen, liver, jejunum, uterus, serum, tonsil) of the inoculated sows, confirming the replication of Virus X in the animals, particularly in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, the virus was also isolated from fetal tissues such as lung, spleen, heart and kidney, suggesting transplacental transmission of the virus.\", \"All inoculated pigs became viremic during a 14-day observation period but did not show any overt clinical signs by the end of the study. The sham-inoculated negative control pigs remained negative for Virus X in the blood (Table 3\\n).\", \"At each necropsy, significant gross lesions were not apparent although spleen and lymph nodes collected from pigs at days 7 and 10 PI looked edematous. Microscopically, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis was observed in 5 of the 6 inoculated pigs (Fig. 4\\n). Nonsuppurative interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 5\\n) and nonsuppurative periportal hepatitis were other lesions commonly observed in the inoculated pigs. Neither gross nor microscopic lesions were present in tissues/organs of the control pig.\", \"Virus X was recovered from tissues of all inoculated pigs regardless of the presence or absence of detectable lesions. Brain tissues from 4 of the 5 pigs with meningitis or encephalitis were positive for Virus X. The presence of virus particles with morphological characteristics similar to Virus X in brain tissues was confirmed by EM (Fig. 1). The virus was most frequently recovered from tonsils. Spleens and lymph nodes also harbored the virus.\", \"Porcine reproductive and neurologic syndrome brought a challenge to the diagnostic community since no definitive diagnosis as to the cause could be made. Although death loss and reproductive failure in breeding females is not an unusual event in many farms for various reasons, clinical presentations of reproductive problems along with neurologic disorders were a unique feature of PRNS. Unfortunately, diagnostic investigations focusing on all conventional infectious agents that had been implicated in reproductive and/or neurologic problems of pigs at various ages has been unfruitful or yielded inconsistent results. With the hypothesis that a previously unknown infectious agent could be responsible for the disease, extensive laboratory testing resulted in frequent isolation of a relatively small enveloped cytopathic virus (‘Virus X’) from clinically affected animals. Although one might say that Virus X is not necessarily a causative pathogen, isolation of the virus from nervous tissues collected from clinically ill animals with CNS signs is a convincing evidence suggesting that Virus X was likely responsible for the disease. Observations from the animal inoculation study with pregnant sows clearly indicate that Virus X is capable of crossing the placental barrier and causing the loss of pregnancy most likely due to embryonic or fetal death as evident by recovery of the virus from fetal tissues. Furthermore, development of meningitis or encephalitis lesions in the brains of young CDCD pigs after inoculation with Virus X also indicate that the virus may be able to cause neurologic disorder in infected animals, although the inoculated CDCD pigs did not show clinical central nervous signs under experimental conditions. Those lesions were due to the attack by Virus X since the virus was recovered from brain tissues. Since all these experimental findings match well with field observations of PRNS, Virus X is postulated to be the causative agent for PRNS as Koch's postulates were partially fulfilled. It is proposed then that Virus X shall be named “PRNS virus (PRNSV)”.\", \"Under a laboratory setting, PRNSV could not be readily recognized by antibodies raised against various viral agents that have been implicated in diseases of swine except anti-BVDV polyclonal antibody. The positive cross-reactivity of PRNSV with anti-BVDV antibody is of particular interest with respect to taxonomical identification of the virus. The possibility that PRNSV could be CSFV was ruled out at the beginning of the investigation since US swine populations are known to be free of CSFV. Furthermore, diagnostic testing on some early PRNS suspect cases at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory of the National Veterinary Laboratory Service ruled out the presence of CSFV or its infection in those animals as well as the involvement of other foreign animal disease agents (Data not shown). Pigs are known to be susceptible to ruminant pestiviruses such as BVDV and BDV besides porcine pestivirus (i.e., CSFV). Although BVDV infection of pigs has been demonstrated both in the field and under experimental conditions, BVDV has not been considered to be a significant pathogen for pigs. Considering that PRNSV is readily spread among pigs and there is very minimum contact between pigs and ruminants in the US, it would be hard to believe that PRNSV is BVDV or BDV. This argument is supported by negative PCR results (5′ UTR) on isolates of PRNSV for BVDV and CSFV. However, based on its morphological similarity with pestiviruses and cross-reactivity with anti-BVDV antibody, the possibility that PRNSV is a pestivirus cannot be completely ruled out until proven otherwise. At the time of writing this manuscript, PRNSV is proposed to be a novel swine pestivirus which remains to be further characterized for its conclusive taxonomical identification. As a pestivirus is suspected to be responsible for PRNS, development of a specific diagnostic reagent for PRNSV is prudent.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18406081/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508000904; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508000904\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7190306\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)31023-0\",\n  title: \"Remdesivir for COVID-19: challenges of underpowered studies\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-04-29\",\n  authors: [\"John.Norrie\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\n      generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"In The Lancet, Yeming Wang and colleagues1 report a randomised trial of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10, in single daily infusions) versus placebo for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in ten hospitals in Wuhan, China. The authors report on 236 patients (140 [59%] men and 96 [41%] women; median age 65 years [IQR 56–71]), with inconclusive findings on the primary outcome of time to clinical improvement, defined as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale,2 a hazard ratio of 1·23 (95% CI 0·87–1·75; favouring remdesivir), and median observation times of 21 days (IQR 13–28) in the remdesivir group versus 23 days (15–28) in the placebo group (a non-significant difference).\", \"The study was well designed—a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised trial—and well conducted, with high protocol adherence and no loss to follow up. Randomised evidence was needed following high-profile publications on the first US COVID-19 case3 and the subsequent compassionate use of remdesivir in a 53-patient case series,4 which, coupled with in-vitro and animal model evidence, had generated high expectations of remdesivir efficacy.\", \"Promising signals from observational data must be rigorously confirmed or refuted in high-quality randomised trials—particularly given that for COVID-19 no proven safe and effective treatments yet exist. Ideally, efficacy-based trials, including proof-of-mechanism studies, should precede larger pragmatic effectiveness trials.5 That is additionally challenging in a pandemic, and the temptation to lower the threshold of convincing evidence must be resisted, because adopting ineffective and potentially unsafe interventions risks only harm without worthwhile benefit, while making it even harder to undertake trials to find truly effective and safe interventions. We have already seen other drugs, repurposed for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine6 and lopinavir–ritonavir,7 report disappointing findings so far in randomised trials after early promise.\", \"Wang and colleagues' study1 stopped early after 237 of the intended 453 patients were enrolled, because by March 12 there were no further patients meeting eligibility criteria admitted in Wuhan. The study closed on March 29, having begun on Feb 6.\", \"Here, stopping early gives an underpowered trial, which taken alone, gives inconclusive findings. The study has not shown a statistically significant finding that confirms a remdesivir treatment benefit of at least the minimally clinically important difference, nor has it ruled such a benefit out. The study sought a treatment effect of hazard ratio (HR) 1·40, translating to reducing median time to clinical improvement to 15 days (remdesivir) versus 21 days (placebo). The observed HR of 1·23 suggests that a benefit, if it exists, might be smaller than anticipated. This study is the first randomised trial of intravenous remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19, so it is difficult to know what the minimally clinically important difference is.8 That will depend on a complex reckoning of evidence for effectiveness, safety, acceptability, access, and cost. It is possible that even if the 453-patient target was reached, the study would have still been underpowered if a minimally clinically important difference of less than an HR of 1·4 was warranted.\", \"However, likewise, a larger benefit might exist, or remdesivir might actually do harm. It is unknown—more data are needed. Fortunately, ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that five randomised trials involving remdesivir are recruiting globally, with one in severe COVID-19 from Gilead (NCT04292899), the drug manufacturer, with a target of 6000 participants; naively, this trial should be adequately powered.\", \"In the meantime, how can the findings of Wang and colleagues be interpreted? The statistical reporting is clear, stating that the main findings were not statistically significant and acknowledging that the trial was underpowered (their post-hoc calculation indicated a power of 58% given the 236 participants with available data). However, a trial is not just its primary clinical outcome—there are important data on safety, viral load, and secondary outcomes. 22 (14%) of 158 patients on remdesivir died versus ten (13%) of 78 on placebo, and there was no signal that viral load decreased differentially over time between remdesivir and placebo groups. Furthermore, there were no differential signals on safety. Analyses were very similar under both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles.\", \"\\n\\n\", \"The authors also report primary outcome subgroup analyses. Only patients who were 12 days or less from illness onset were eligible overall, so a prespecified subgroup analysis investigated those who started study treatment up to 10 days versus more than 10 days (up to 12 days) from illness onset. Of course, even with an adequately powered study, subgroup analyses are generally not powered (and here, the 2:1 allocation further reduced power). There was no significant interaction of 10 days or less versus more than 10 days—ie, little support statistically of treatment effect moderation by time of initiation. Nor was either the 10 days or less or the more than 10 days within-subgroup treatment effects significant. Nonetheless, the authors give prominence to the 10 days or less subgroup, reporting a non-statistically significant HR of 1·52 (95% CI 0·95 to 2·43), median 18 days (IQR 12 to 28) versus 23 days (15 to 28), and a non-significant reduction in mortality (difference −3·6% [95% CI −16·2 to 8·9]). There was a possible baseline imbalance with 71 (45%) remdesivir patients versus 47 (60%) placebo patients in the 10 days or less subgroup, and possibly more patients with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease allocated to remdesivir than placebo, making interpretation even more difficult. Subgroup analyses, particularly for phase 3 confirmatory effectiveness trials, have justifiably been criticised9 and even ridiculed.10 Giving a subgroup analysis prominence over the primary analysis is unfortunately common. In early phase studies in a pandemic, little is known for certain, and it seems biologically plausible that treating patients earlier could be more effective. Nonetheless, as well as being vigilant against overinterpretation, we need to ensure that hypotheses generated in efficacy-based trials, even in subgroups, are confirmed or refuted in subsequent adequately powered trials or meta-analyses.\", \"We have already seen how different interpretations will be put on these results, with the unintended early release of this study's results on the WHO website.11 This underlines how labelling of trials is mistaken as positive or negative—equating a p>0·05 with no evidence of benefit. There has been a welcome discussion of p value limitations recently.12 An absence of statistical significance in an underpowered trial means that the findings are inconclusive. The particular challenges of delivering pandemic trials underline the importance of data sharing, allowing rapid curation of relevant datasets for individual patient data meta-analyses.13 With each individual study at heightened risk of being incomplete, pooling data across possibly several underpowered but high-quality studies looks like our best way to obtain robust insights into what works, safely, and on whom.

It was an unusual sound that took months to be registered by astute clinicians and the public health system [1]. Today, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is widely recognized as a distinctive clinical entity; it is associated with a precipitous cardiorespiratory decomposition, thrombocytopenia, and atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear and is transmitted by rodents throughout the Americas [2]. The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and Sin Nombre virus were quickly identified as the primary reservoir and etiological agent of disease, respectively, in the originally recognized outbreak in the southwestern United States [3] and, subsequently, in most of North America.\", \"The initial recognition of HPS in the United States hinged on the combined employment of some classically trained virologists and the relatively new skills of molecular biologists at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories who had studied and refined diagnostic tests and treatments for hantaviruses of little relevance to the United States associated with Korean hemorrhagic fever and other hemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome in Eurasia [4]. Their pioneering work led to a reclassification of hantaviruses into 2 distinct groups: (1) Old World hantaviruses, which are associated with renal syndrome, and (2) New World hantaviruses, which typically cause cardiopulmonary disease. The initial recognition in North America rapidly led to the description of numerous newly recognized viruses—in excess of 30 species—found throughout the Americas. New World hantaviruses are associated with a plethora of rodent host species in the sigmodontine subfamily, each with a unique rodent-virus species pairing. These viruses cause a spectrum of clinical illnesses designated as “new hantavirusassociated American hemorrhagic fever” and are thought to represent a coevolutionary relationship between New World rodents and their viruses [2, 3, 5, 6].\", \"The recognition of HPS coincided with an Institute of Medicine report on emerging infections that warned about complacency toward infectious diseases in the era of improved sanitation and immunizations [7]. Similar international recognition of these microbial threats led to a global response that was accelerated after an anthrax bioterrorism incident in the United States and that served the world well for the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome [8].\", \"Andes virus (ANDV)–associated HPS in Argentina and Chile has evidenced a unique predilection for limited person-toperson transmission. To date, there have been at least 6 reports supported by epidemiological and/or molecular data suggesting a potential for person-to-person transmission of ANDV [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The latest is the elegant study by Ferrés et al. [14] presented in this issue of the Journal; it prospectively followed 421 household contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed ANDV infection to test the hypothesis that ANDV retains the ability to be transmitted from person to person. The authors determined that sex partners of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases were at the greatest risk of infection, with an estimated secondary attack rate of 2.5% and detectable viremia 5–15 days before the onset of symptoms. The biological basis for person-to-person transmission of ANDV requires definitive characterization; however, ANDV is the only hantavirus that has been isolated from human serum and that consistently kills Syrian hamsters [15]. This evidence suggests that infection with ANDV results in a higher viral load [16] and perhaps that humans are a much more permissive host for this particular strain than for other hantaviruses. The data suggest that person-toperson transmission is the result of direct contact during the preclinical phase of infection (which is consistent with the timing of viremia) and that the disease is most likely to have an incubation period of 2– 4 weeks and to occur after contact with subsequently severely ill patients. It also explains the paucity of nosocomial transmission, because contact with health care workers is likely to occur much later, during the clinical phase of infection.\", \"We are becoming ever more cognizant that the vast majority of emerging pathogens have zoonotic origins [17]. Through limited person-to-person transmission events, some of these pathogens may be able to establish themselves in a new permissive host or vector. HIV, influenza virus, measles virus, Plasmodium falciparum, and smallpox virus—all pathogens hypothesized to be of zoonotic origin—are but a few examples of human pathogens arising from evolutionary events across millennia. [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Human dengue and urban yellow fever may be examples of a new reservoir allowing sustained person-to-person transmission [23]. Limited person-to-person transmission also characterizes the current panzoonotic H5N1 strain of influenza virus, for which there has been intense scrutiny of the biological mechanism that enables human transmission.\", \"Global pandemic influenza preparedness illustrates a unique challenge for the public health system: responding to diseases that result from the intersection of animals, humans, and the environment. Success will require coordination between the animal and human health sectors [24, 25]. The ongoing H5N1 epizootic, the Rift Valley fever outbreaks in eastern Africa, and the monkeypox outbreak in the United States have illustrated that need. This is an area that has been woefully neglected to date. As the world's population continues to grow, interactions between humans and novel pathogens are likely to increase, resulting in greater numbers of emerging and reemerging diseases [26]. To help understand the ecologies of infectious diseases, the DHHS/CDC, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and numerous ministries of health, is currently establishing Global Disease Detection (GDD) centers in 5 of the 6 WHO regions across the globe. These GDD centers will work in concert with the DoD–Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) centers as partners within the WHO–Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN). The interactions between the DHHS/CDC-GDD centers, the DoD-GEIS centers, and WHOGOARN will undoubtedly enhance global disease surveillance and host country capacity, reducing the overall time from outbreak recognition to response and disease prevention.\", \"These efforts need to be reinforced with coordinated surveillance and rapid-response activities through interactions between ministries of health, US government agencies (DHHS, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of State, and the DoD), United Nations agencies (WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization), the World Organization for Animal Health, and academia and other nongovernmental organizations (e.g., Médecins sans Frontières). We also need increasing emphasis on building local capacities and conducting integrative studies across the animal, human, and environmental domains; on discovery research; and on strategic partnerships. Recognizing and preventing the next pandemic—be it of H5N1 influenza, an efficient human-to-human hantavirus, or an as-yet unidentified pathogen—can be achieved only through strategic animal/human health partnerships and enhanced global disease surveillance.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17471422/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC3205848\",\n  doi: \"10.1378/chest.11-0047\",\n  title: \"The Effect of Steroid Use in Hospitalized Adults With Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Related Illness\",\n  doc_date: \"2011-11-01\",\n  authors: [\"F..Lee\", \"Edward.Walsh\", \"Ann.Falsey\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Study Design ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Sample Collection ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Illness Evaluations ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction ::: Laboratory Methods ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Serum IgG and Nasal IgA Enzyme Immunoassay and Serum Neutralization Assay ::: Laboratory Methods ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Serum ::: Cytokine Assays ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Nasal Samples ::: Cytokine Assays ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Polychromatic Flow Cytometry ::: Cytokine Assays ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Statistical Methods ::: Materials and Methods ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Results ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Discussion ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Discussion ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Discussion ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Discussion ::: Materials and Methods\", \"Discussion ::: Materials and Methods\"],\n      generic: [\"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"The study was conducted during three consecutive winters between 2005 and 2008 at Rochester General Hospital in Rochester, New York.

Of these, 50 were hospitalized and 61 were treated as outpatients. Thirty-three of 50 inpatients (66%) received at least 1 day of systemic corticosteroids compared with three of 61 (5%) outpatients. The analysis of immunologic and virologic changes associated with systemic corticosteroid use was restricted to the hospitalized cohort to provide more balanced illness severity in the comparison groups. Although a variety of steroid regimens were prescribed, most patients received 4 to 10 mg of dexamethasone or 40 to 60 mg of methylprednisolone every 6 h for 1 to 2 days followed by an oral prednisone taper. The mean duration of steroid therapy was 11.3 ± 7.3 days with a range from 1 to 27 days. Five subjects received 2 or fewer days of corticosteroid treatment. Seven subjects were taking oral corticosteroids prior to admission, and all were given IV corticosteroids or higher doses of oral prednisone treatment while hospitalized.\", \"Predictably, the clinical features of the subjects who received corticosteroids were different from those who were not treated (Table 1\\n). Although most differences did not achieve statistical significance, those given steroids in the hospital were more often men with a history of COPD and were receiving oral steroids and supplemental oxygen prior to admission. The presence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease was slightly more common among those not treated with corticosteroids. Admitting diagnoses were similar between the two groups, although COPD exacerbation was most common among those treated with steroids, and a diagnosis of pneumonia was the leading diagnosis for those not treated. Wheezing at the time of admission was more common in the steroid group, whereas the patients not treated with steroids patients were more often febrile. Although not significantly different, there was a trend toward higher rates of infiltrates on chest radiographs and mean peripheral WBC counts in those not treated with steroids.\", \"Overall, the hospital course for patients who received corticosteroids was similar to those who were not treated (Table 2\\n). Rates of respiratory failure, intensive care admission, and in-hospital mortality were not significantly different. Two patients in the steroid-treated group died, and in both cases patients were placed on hospice care because of longstanding severe COPD. No patients developed nosocomial bacterial infections, and there were no overt complications related to steroid treatment, such as psychosis or severe glucose dysregulation. Although the mean last days of reported wheezing or dyspnea were significantly longer in the steroid-treated group compared with those not treated, the length of hospital stay and illness duration were not significantly different.\", \"Group A and B viruses were evenly distributed in those treated with steroids vs those who were not treated. Viral shedding was not prolonged, nor was the mean viral load higher in the steroid-treated group (Figs 1A, 1B\\n). Inflammatory mediators were measured in nasal samples at enrollment, day 12, and day 28 and were not consistently different in either group (Table 3\\n). There was a trend toward lower acute serum IL-6 levels in patients treated with steroids compared with those not treated (5.4 ± 8.5 vs 17.2 ± 34.4, P = .08). Of note, blood samples were collected on average 2 days after steroids were begun. By day 28, serum IL-6 levels were similar in both groups.\", \"RSV-specific serum and nasal antibody titers measured at the time of enrollment were not significantly different between groups. Serum and nasal antibody responses to RSV infection were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group (Figs 2A, 2B\\n) with convalescent titers approximately twofold lower compared with the untreated group. However, only serum-neutralizing antibody responses to group A virus (P = .05) and nasal IgA to the fusion protein (P = .01) were significantly lower.\", \"Twenty-nine randomly selected subjects (16 steroid treated and 13 untreated) had T and B lymphocyte subpopulations analyzed at three time points: acute (∼ 36-48 h after initiating steroids), day 12 to 14, and day 28 post illness.

Notably, 31% of the steroid-treated group (of whom two were receiving steroids prior to admission) and 46% of the untreated group had an ALC of < 1.0 × 103/μL at presentation to the hospital. For those receiving steroids who had repeat measurements, the mean ALC was 0.8 ± 0.5 × 103/μL at 24 h, 1.2 ± 0.7 × 103/μL between days 2 and 6, and 1.2 ± 0.4 × 103/μL after day 9.\", \"Representative flow cytometry results are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4\\nfor a random subset of 35 and 23 patients for T- and B-cell panels, respectively, at the mid time point (day 8-14). Analysis of early and late testing demonstrated similar findings in B- and T-cell subsets (data not shown). A representative sample of B- and T-cell subsets is shown in e-Figure 1A and 1B. No significant differences between steroid-treated and steroid-untreated subjects at any of the time points were noted regarding the total percentage of B cells (% CD19+), CD27+ memory B cells, antibody secreting cells (ASC), or plasmablasts (Fig 3). Additionally, there were no significant differences in the fraction of CD3+ T cells, monocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells (naive and memory), and natural killer cells (subsets of CD56+CD16hi and CD56hi) (Fig 4).\", \"In our study of patients hospitalized with RSV-related respiratory illness, short-term systemic corticosteroids were not associated with significant adverse clinical or virologic outcomes. No episodes of severe hyperglycemia, avascular bone necrosis, or steroid-induced psychosis were observed during the hospitalization or 1-month follow-up period. However, it is important to note that our study was not powered to detect important clinical steroid-related adverse events. Given the importance of cellular immunity for viral clearance and the recognized effects of long-term steroid use, we were surprised that peak RSV viral loads and duration of viral shedding were not increased in the steroid-treated group.20 This finding may reflect the relatively brief course of systemic steroids received by study participants. Although steroids exert an antiinflammatory effect, no uniform trend was detected in serum or nasal cytokine levels in patients receiving steroids.\", \"The complex quantitative and qualitative effects of systemic glucocorticosteroids on the host immune response are well described.21 Nearly every type of immune cell, including B and T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, are affected. A substantial reduction in circulating lymphocytes can be demonstrated almost immediately upon injection of hydrocortisone in animal studies, with no further effect of increased dose or duration.22 Lymphopenia is reversible but lasts throughout the period of exposure. Steroids also inhibit T-cell activation, lymphocyte proliferation, and T helper 1/T helper 2 regulation.21 Given the known effects of steroids on the immune system, the lack of significant differences in lymphocyte numbers and subsets in our steroid-treated subjects is puzzling. However, very few data are available on the immune affects of steroids in acutely ill patients, particularly those with viral infections. Lymphopenia is associated with a number of acute viral infections, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.23, 24 It is noteworthy that many of the patients in this study were lymphopenic at the time of presentation, and thus it is possible that RSV infection induces significant immunologic perturbations that may complicate interpretation of a steroid effect.\", \"The primary adverse effect of steroid use appeared to be a modestly diminished serum and secretory antibody response. Although differences were only statistically significant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded significant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specific protective antibody titer is not known.19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these findings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a significant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specific T-cell responses or ASC, which may have been preferentially affected by steroid administration.\", \"Our study is limited by the small sample size, the lack of randomization, and the restriction to one type of viral infection. Because steroids were more commonly used in patients with COPD, which is an inflammatory condition, the effects of steroids on inflammatory markers and immune function may have been difficult to discern given the unequal distribution of patients with COPD in the analysis groups. Although it is reasonable to presume steroid effects would be similar for other respiratory viruses, RSV has unique immunomodulatory effects, and, therefore, our findings may not be broadly applicable.26, 27, 28\\n\", \"In conclusion, a short course of systemic corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with acute RSV infection was not associated with major deleterious side effects. Since specific respiratory viral infections, with the exception of influenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassuring. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinflammatory effects and potential clinical benefits.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21565965/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369211605801; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369211605801; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3205848?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.11-0047\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7138107\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68624-8\",\n  title: \"Poliomyelitis eradication and pandemic influenza\",\n  doc_date: \"2006-05-04\",\n  authors: [\"David.Heymann\", \"R.Aylward\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\n      generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"When an outbreak of febrile haemorrhagic disease first occurred in the Ulge Province of Angola in November, 2004, it was the poliomyelitis surveillance officer in that province who did the initial case investigation, collected blood specimens, and ensured that those specimens were sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for Haemorrhagic Fevers.1 After the diagnosis of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, the poliomyelitis surveillance officers provided logistic support to the national and international team that implemented containment activities, which included case finding, contact tracing, case management and infection control in adapted isolation facilities, on-site laboratory diagnosis, safe burial, and social mobilisation. In addition, all 65 poliomyelitis eradication officers in Angola, of whom six are international and the rest nationals, organised mobile teams for active surveillance in provinces at risk outside the outbreak zone to investigate and report suspect cases.\", \"These poliomyelitis surveillance officers are part of a worldwide system for surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis that identifies, investigates, and collects specimens each year from over 60 000 paralysed children under the age of 15 years in more than 190 countries.2 The system is supported by the poliomyelitis eradication partners—Rotary International, UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO—through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). This system, which is constantly monitored for performance against international surveillance standards, provides a structure for rapidly detecting and responding to diseases of national and international importance, and in some resource-poor countries in Africa and south Asia is the most reliable surveillance and response mechanism available.\", \"Poliomyelitis surveillance officers also support countries in planning, social mobilisation, and implementation of poliovirus vaccination campaigns; and they train school teachers and community volunteers to participate in vaccination campaigns along with health workers. Vaccination coverage of more than 90% is usually attained, providing near-universal access to oral poliovirus vaccine, with performance assessed by independent monitors.\", \"Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis is underpinned by a network of 145 laboratories in 90 countries that isolate and genetically characterise polioviruses, providing an understanding of their geographical distribution and guiding response activities.3 These laboratories, some of which receive external financial support from GPEI, use standard equipment, reagents, and methods. They must be reaccredited every 1–2 years to remain in the network, and are distributed around the world (figure\\n).\", \"There are 279 international and 2964 national GPEI-funded poliomyelitis eradication staff in over 50 countries with or at risk of wild poliovirus infection (table\\n). These staff are concentrated in areas with the weakest health systems. Mainly because of financing constraints, the number of GPEI-funded surveillance officers is systematically reduced as countries are certified poliomyelitis-free, with some transferred to other international funding sources (eg, for activities to reduce measles mortality) or national government service. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers are usually medical epidemiologists who have been specially trained in poliomyelitis surveillance, case investigation and outbreak response, and are equipped with computers, transport, and real-time communication capacity through cell or satellite phones.\", \"In over 125 countries, the epidemiological and laboratory capacities have been broadened to include diseases such as measles, yellow fever, the haemorrhagic fevers, meningitis, and Japanese encephalitis.4 The network has also been mobilised to support countries during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Most recently, capacities have been broadened to include avian influenza. For example, in Kaduna State in Nigeria, poliomyelitis surveillance officers provided key messages about avian influenza to community leaders during poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns in early February, and poliomyelitis surveillance officers are now providing such messages throughout Nigeria. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers in Maharashtra State in India have been asked to report any information they obtain on sick or dying poultry to federal health authorities.\", \"Further broadening the epidemiological capacities of poliomyelitis surveillance officers by providing training in influenza can substantially enhance surveillance and investigation of severe respiratory disease in human beings living in areas where there are lethal outbreaks in poultry and, potentially, assist in the early detection of avian disease. Broadening the laboratory capacity to include diagnosis of H5N1 where feasible could provide wider support to the influenza-laboratory network. Should there be a need for rapid and effective social mobilisation and distribution of antiviral drugs or eventually vaccines, the capacity of the poliomyelitis eradication officers to ensure access is proven.\", \"External support for national poliomyelitis surveillance is presently borne entirely by GPEI, with about US$100 million in annual funding from donor countries, multilateral institutions, foundations, and Rotary International. Broadening the funding base for this unique international public-health surveillance and laboratory network could maintain its geographical distribution and ensure a stronger response capacity for any national or international pandemic of influenza. To ignore this dividend of the 20-year international investment in poliomyelitis eradication will increase vulnerability to avian influenza in countries where health systems are weakest and least able to detect and respond.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138107/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7140243\",\n  doi: \"10.1007/s15033-017-0557-4\",\n  title: \"Diagnostik granulomatöser Erkrankungen mit Lungenbefall\",\n  doc_date: \"2017-02-22\",\n  authors: [\"Stella.Piel\", \"Michael.Kreuter\", \"Felix.Herth\", \"Hans-Ulrich.Kauczor\", \"Claus.Heußel\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Radiologische Stadieneinteilung ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Radiologische Stadieneinteilung ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Extrapulmonale Beteiligungen ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Lymphadenopathie ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Pulmonale Manifestationen ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Pulmonale Manifestationen ::: Sarkoidose\", \"Bildgebung ::: Exogen-allergische Alveolitis\", \"Bildgebung ::: Exogen-allergische Alveolitis\", \"Bildgebung ::: Exogen-allergische Alveolitis\", \"Chronische Form ::: Exogen-allergische Alveolitis\", \"Pulmonale Manifestationen ::: Granulomatose mit Polyangiitis\", \"Veränderungen im Krankheitsverlauf ::: Granulomatose mit Polyangiitis\", \"Veränderungen im Krankheitsverlauf ::: Granulomatose mit Polyangiitis\", \"Akute Form ::: Silikose\", \"Klassische Form ::: Silikose\", \"Bildgebung\", \"Bildgebung\", \"Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose\", \"Tuberkulose\", \"Tuberkulose\", \"Tuberkulose\", \"Nicht tuberkulöse Mykobakteriosen\", \"Nicht tuberkulöse Mykobakteriosen\", \"Nicht tuberkulöse Mykobakteriosen\", \"Nicht tuberkulöse Mykobakteriosen\", \"Weitere Erkrankungen\", \"Fazit für die Praxis\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\", \"CME-Fragebogen\"],\n      generic: [\"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Bei mehr als 90 % der Patienten mit Sarkoidose zeigen sich im Lauf der Erkrankung in der Thoraxübersicht pathologische Befunde. Trotz eines z. T. sehr auffälligen Röntgenbildes bleiben 60 % der Patienten asymptomatisch [2]. Eine radiologische Stadieneinteilung anhand des Röntgenbildes wurde von Scadding et al. bereits im Jahr 1961 etabliert. Diese wird teilweise auch heute noch verwendet, obwohl sie wissenschaftlich nicht mehr aktuell ist, sich das Ausmaß der Erkrankung nicht alleine durch das konventionelle Röntgenbild beurteilen lässt und der teilweise in Bezug auf die Prognose signifikantere extrapulmonale Befall hierdurch nicht abgebildet wird (▶Tab. 1).\", \"Manifestationen, die in der CT, aber nicht in der\\nThoraxübersicht erkennbar sind, werden in dieser Stadieneinteilung nicht berücksichtigt. Die CT hilft v. a. bei unklaren klinischen und/oder radiologischen Befunden [43], bei begründetem klinischem Verdacht auf Sarkoidose und gleichzeitigem Vorliegen eines unauffälligen Röntgenbildes und bei der Detektion von Komplikationen der pulmonalen Erkrankung [3].\", \"Eine nachgewiesene extrapulmonale Beteiligung bei Sarkoidose besteht in ca. 30 % der Fälle. Dabei ist am häufigsten ein abdomineller Befall bei bis zu 70 % der Patienten mit extrapulmonalen Manifestationen. Die Leber ist in bis zu 80 % dieser Fälle betroffen, dabei handelt es sich um Hepatomegalie, multiple hypodense, teils konfluierende Noduli, Zeichen der portalen Hypertension und der Leberzirrhose oder eine Pfortaderthrombose. Eine Milzbeteiligung besteht in 23–54 % der Fälle; in 30 % der Fälle mit abdomineller Beteiligung zeigt sich eine Lymphadenopathie, v. a. im Bereich der Leberpforte, paraaortal und um den Truncus coeliacus [4]. Weitere wichtige extrapulmonale Manifestationen der Sarkoidose betreffen Haut (25 %), Herz (5–10 %), Augen 25 %, zentrales Nervensystem (5 %) und selten Nieren [5, 6].\", \"Typisch für das radiologische Stadium I und II ist die bihiläre Lymphadenopathie (▶Abb. 1). Die Lymphknoten zeigen in der Regel keine Zeichen einer Nekrose sowie keine relevanten raumfordernden Effekte [44]. Kavernen sind selten (▶Abb. 2). Bei langem Krankheitsverlauf können sie Verkalkungen aufweisen [7]; in der MRT kann schon früh ein Schießscheibenzeichen der Lymphknoten erkennbar sein (▶Abb. 3; [8]). Umgekehrt ist eine bihiläre Lymphadenopathie selten bösartig (in 3,8 % der Fälle liegt ein malignes Lymphom vor, in 0,8 % ein Bronchialkarzinom, in 0,2 % extrathorakale Malignome [9]).\", \"Die häufigste pulmonale Manifestation der Sarkoidose sind Mikronoduli und Noduli mit einem Durchmesser von 1–10 mm und unscharfer Begrenzung. Diese haben eine „random“, d. h. eine „zufällige“ Verteilung, also sowohl zentrilobulär als auch perilymphatisch, wobei letzteres richtungsweisend für eine Sarkoidose spricht. Typischerweise liegt eine Betonung der Mittel- und Oberfelder vor. Dichteanhebung und irregulärer Verlauf der bronchovaskulären Bündel werden häufig beobachtet. Oft konfluieren mehrere Mikronoduli zu einem größeren Knoten >10 mm, umgeben von zahlreichen kleinen, satellitenartig angeordneten Mikronoduli, von Nakatsu [10] mit dem Begriff „sarcoid galaxy“ bezeichnet (▶Abb. 1). Konsolidierungen mit oder ohne Bronchopneumogramm treten bei 12–38 % der Patienten auf [2]. Retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung sowie Milchglasinfiltrate kommen ebenso vor und sind ein Hinweis auf den Übergang der Erkrankung in eine fibrosierende Form (▶Abb. 4).\", \"Im radiologischen Stadium IV stehen fibrotische Veränderungen im Vordergrund. Es zeigen sich Deformierungen und Distorsionen der Bronchien, Konsolidierungen, Rundherde, retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung, seltener Traktionsbronchiektasen (38 %), Honigwabenmuster (32 %) v. a. in den Oberlappen, Emphysem (12 %) und Zysten (19 %) [11]. Dabei kann sich ein das Muster einer gewöhnlichen interstitiellen Pneumonie (UIP) ergeben, welches aufgrund seiner apikalen Betonung von dem für eine idiopathische pulmonale Fibrose (IPF) typischen UIP-Muster mit basaler Betonung manchmal unterschieden werden kann (▶Abb. 4) [45].\", \"Die Bildgebung spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Diagnosestellung. In den etablierten Diagnosekriterien der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin (DGP) und der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Allergologie und Klinische Immunologie (DGAKI) für akute/subakute EAA werden Röntgen- und, sofern vorhanden, Dünnschicht-CT-Zeichen einer EAA gefordert. So ist ein entsprechender radiologischer Befund in der Dünnschicht-CT eines der Diagnosekriterien für eine chronische EAA [12]. Je nach Stadium sind unterschiedliche Befunde zu erwarten: Die Thoraxübersicht ist bei der akuten EAA in 20–30 % der Fälle unauffällig [13]. In den restlichen Fällen zeigen sich beidseitige interstitielle Infiltrate, meist unter Aussparung der kostophrenischen Winkel. Bei der chronischen EAA sind retikuläre und noduläre Zeichnungsvermehrungen zu erwarten, v. a. im mittleren und apikalen Feld, ggf. auch Zeichen eines Emphysems oder eines Cor pulmonale. Die Dünnschicht-CT ist damit der diagnostische Standard bei Verdacht auf eine EAA, gerade auch bei unauffälliger Thoraxübersichtsaufnahme [40].\", \"Im akuten und subakuten Stadium ist ein diffuses Milchglasmuster v. a. in Mittel- und Unterfeldern zu erwarten (▶Abb. 5). Bei der subakuten Form zeigen sich zusätzlich auch unscharf begrenzte, „wattebauschartige“ zentrilobuläre Knötchen sowie ein Mosaikmuster durch „airtrapping“ bei Bronchiolitis der terminalen Bronchiolen. Letzteres kann in der Exspirations-CT deutlicher gesehen werden.\", \"Die Kombination von Milchglasinfiltraten und Mosaikmuster bezeichnet man als „head cheese sign“ („Presskopfzeichen“), d. h. das benachbarte Auftreten lobulärer Areale mit erniedrigter, normaler und angehobener Dichte. Früher wurde dies als ein hochspezifisches radiologisches Zeichen der EAA gedeutet, mittlerweile ist es aber auch bei weiteren Erkrankungen beschrieben worden, wie u. a. bei Infektionen mit Bronchiolitis (z. B. Virus-, Chlamydien- oder Mykoplasmenpneumonie), Sarkoidose, respiratorischer Bronchiolitis mit interstitieller Lungenerkrankung (RB-ILD [14]). Im Falle eines gleichzeitigen Auftretens von Milchglas, Knötchen und Mosaikmuster sowie passender Anamnese und Klinik besteht eine hohe Spezifität für die Diagnose einer EAA [13].\", \"Eine radiologische und klinische Herausforderung ist die chronische EAA. Dabei ist eine Überlappung der Befunde zum akuten und subakuten Stadium möglich. Es finden sich v. a. retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung in Mittel- und Oberfeldern, zentrilobuläre Knötchen, Milchglas sowie Mosaikmuster. Bei der fortgeschrittenen EAA kommt es oft zu Traktionsbronchiektasen, Volumenminderung, Verdickung von Interlobulärsepten und fibrotischem Umbau mit Honigwabenmuster, sodass ein radiologisches UIP-Muster möglich ist. Die zentrilobulären Noduli der Frühphasen können fehlen, was die differenzialdiagnostische Abgrenzung zur idiopathischen Lungenfibrose erschwert. Ebenso ist eine idiopathische nichtspezifische interstitieller Pneumonie (NSIP) als Differenzialdiagnose möglich (▶Abb. 6; [15]). Eine Untersuchung von Silva [16] hat folgende wesentliche Unterschiede einer chronischen EAA im Vergleich zu IPF hervorgehoben: Bei der EAA zeigen sich signifikant öfter lobuläre Areale mit Dichteminderung weniger in den Unterfeldern, sondern v. a. in den Mittel- und Oberfeldern mit zentrilobulären Noduli. Auch „airtrapping“, nachgewiesen durch zusätzliche Aufnahmen in Exspiration, war signifikant häufiger bei einer chronischen EAA zu sehen (75 %) als bei IPF (35 %) oder NSIP (10 %). Als Besonderheit der chronischen EAA bei einer Farmerlunge ist die höhere Prävalenz von Emphysemen zu nennen [17]. Zusammenfassend kann eine Abgrenzung zu den Differenzialdiagnosen nur im interdisziplinären Kontext erfolgen.\", \"Die typischen pulmonalen Manifestationen betreffen sowohl das Tracheobronchialsystem als auch das Lungenparenchym. Tracheobronchial kommt es in 10–30 % der Fälle zu Stenosierungen, oft an mehreren Lokalisationen [13]; am häufigsten ist dabei die subglottische Trachealstenose. Ferner treten Schleimhautnekrosen an den unteren Atemwegen auf, aus denen oft Stenosen, postobstruktive Infektionen und inflammatorische Pseudotumoren hervorgehen. Darüber hinaus kommt es manchmal zur tracheobronchialen Malazie, ösophagobronchialen Fisteln und Bronchiektasen. Der Trachealbefall kann uni- oder multifokal sein und ist im Mittel 2–4 cm lang. Charakteristisch ist der Befall der gesamten Trachea inklusive ihrer Hinterwand (Pars membranacea), die bei anderen Erkrankungen oft ausgespart bleibt.\", \"Die häufigste Veränderung (Prävalenz von 70 %) in der CT ist der Rundherd im Lauf der Erkrankung [18] mit Neigung zur zentralen Nekrose (in 50 % der Fälle, v. a. bei Knoten >2 cm) und Kavernenbildung (▶Abb. 7). Diese können sich rasch entwickeln und auf die Thoraxwand übergreifen. Ein Halozeichen zeigt sich dabei in 15 % der Fälle, seltener ein Reverse-Halo- oder Atollzeichen. Die Rundherde haben eine variable Verteilung, häufig bestehen auch wechselnde Infiltrate. Oft beobachtet man ohne adäquate Therapie eine Kavernenbildung, unter Behandlung dagegen können Kavernen ausheilen und plattenartige Vernarbungen ausbilden. Knoten, die nicht mit klinischer oder serologischer Aktivität der Erkrankung korrelieren und größenprogredient sind, sollten aufgrund des zweifach erhöhten Malignitätsrisikos bei der GPA invasiv abgeklärt werden [18, 19]. Ebenso kann es im Rahmen der Vaskulitis zur Kapillaritis im Lungenparenchym kommen. Eine alveoläre Hämorrhagie tritt dann bei ca. 10 % der Patienten mit Kapillaritis auf [13]. Bei einer akuten alveolären Hämorrhagie zeigen sich Milchglasinfiltrate. Bei rezidivierenden Blutungen können auch retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrungen, ein peripheres Honigwabenmuster und Traktionsbronchiektasen entstehen [20].\", \"Sowohl bei bei GPA als auch viel häufiger bei MPA ist die Entwicklung einer Fibrose mit UIP-Muster, seltener mit NSIP-Muster, möglich und kann anderen klinischen Manifestationen der Vaskulitis vorausgehen [21, 22]. Nebenbefundlich werden Pleuraergüsse in bis zu 20 % der Fälle beobachtet, entweder als Zeichen des Pleurabefalls oder als hydropische Dekompensationszeichen bei Nierenbefall. Selten zeigen sich auch mediastinale Lymphknotenvergrößerungen (▶Abb. 8).\", \"Die Erkrankung kann in zwei verschiedenen Formen auftreten: die akute und die klassische Silikose. Die wichtigste Ursache für die akute Silikose ist eine massive Exposition gegenüber auslösenden Noxen. Es kommt zu einem frühen Erkrankungsbeginn innerhalb von 2 Jahren. Die akute Silikose manifestiert sich in der Regel klinisch und radiologisch als eine Alveolitis. Radiologisch kommen in der Thoraxübersicht diffuse, beidseitige, basale alveoläre Infiltrate, in der CT beidseitige Milchglasinfiltrate bei gefüllten Alveolen (histologisch einer alveolären Silikoproteinose entsprechend) zur Darstellung. Der Verlauf zeichnet sich durch frühen Progress zum Lungenversagen und die schlechte Prognose aus.\", \"Die klassische Silikose tritt in der Regel länger als 5 Jahre nach Staubexposition auf und führt zu einer langsam progredienten Lungenfunktionseinschränkung, wobei verschiedene Komplikationen an anderen Organsystemen möglich sind. Hierbei gehen die radiologischen Manifestationen in der Regel den klinischen und funktionellen Veränderungen voraus. Die Grundlage der radiologischen Diagnostik bildet die Thoraxübersicht. Dort zeigen sich in der Regel ein feinretikuläres Muster mit kleinen Fleckschatten, disseminierte Noduli in den Ober- und Mittelfeldern, oft zentrale Verkalkungen sowie Verschmelzung zu irregulären Konglomeraten von 1 cm bis zu Lappengröße in den Mittelfeldern und pleurale Schwielenbildung (▶Abb. 9). Eine Höhlenbildung in Konglomeratknoten ist aufgrund oben genannter Nekrosen möglich. Oft zu erkennen ist ein kompensatorisches (Narben-)Emphysem mit Überblähung und Bullae neben Konglomeraten (▶Abb. 10). Die Hiluslymphknoten sind vergrößert mit peripherer eierschalenartiger Verkalkung [25].\", \"Die radiologischen Befunde der Silikose werden nach der International Labour Organization (ILO) klassifiziert. Dort werden „kleine Schatten“ auf dem Lungenbild mit rundlicher, unregelmäßiger und gemischter Form ebenso erwähnt wie „große Schatten“. Die Klassifikation erfolgt anhand von Größe, Form, Ausdehnung/Streuung und befallenen Feldern. Bezüglich der Pleura gehen diffuse Verdickungen, Pleuraplaques und die Adhärenz des kostophrenischen Winkels in die Bewertung ein [26]. Selten ist der Einsatz einer Dünnschicht-CT nötig, empfohlen wird dies laut der aktuellen S2-Leitlinie bei fortwährender diagnostischer Unsicherheit nach einer Zweitbegutachtung der Röntgenübersicht im Rahmen der Diagnostik der Berufskrankheit. Die CT soll in Low-dose-Technik und nach standardisierten Vorgaben erfolgen [27].\", \"Das Risiko für das Auftreten eines Bronchialkarzinoms, einer Tuberkulose (in diesem Fall Silikotuberkulose) und einer Kollagenose ist bei Silikosepatienten erhöht. Ebenso besteht eine gesteigerte Infektanfälligkeit, sodass opportunistische Infektionen, u. a. invasive Mykosen, ebenso gehäuft auftreten. Daher kann insbesondere bei akut kranken Patienten oder inkonklusiver Röntgenübersicht die CT von hoher klinisch-diagnostischer Bedeutung sein [28, 29].\", \"Bei der Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose (LCH) handelt es sich um eine seltene Erkrankung, die sowohl als klonale, generalisierte Form im Kindes- und Jugendalter als auch lokalisiert und im Erwachsenenalter auftreten kann. Hier wird über die diffuse pulmonale Verlaufsform des Erwachsenen berichtet (pLCH). Die pLCH tritt bei Rauchern auf und geht mit einer Proliferation der Langerhans-Zellen in den Atemwegen einher. Histologisch zeigen sich Granulome mit Langerhans-Zellen und eosinophilen Granulozyten. Das konventionelle Röntgenbild ist in der Regel nicht diagnostisch. In der hochauflösenden („high resolution“, HR) Dünnschicht-CT sieht man oft das pathognomonische „Schrotschussmuster“: Irregulär verteilte, die ganze Lunge betreffende, unscharf begrenzte zentrilobuläre Noduli (1–5 mm im Durchmesser), selten größere Noduli mit Durchmesser >10 mm, die teils zentral einschmelzen können, sowie begleitende zystische Läsionen (▶Abb. 11). Die Zysten sind oft kleiner als 2 cm, unregelmäßig, zu Beginn dick- und im späteren Stadium der Erkrankung dünnwandig (Wanddicke <1 mm). Ober- und Mittelfelder sind vermehrt betroffen, die Herde sind wahllos vom Zentrum nach außen verteilt. Selten treten Milchglasinfiltrate und eine paratracheale und mediastinale Lymphadenopathie auf [30]. Das charakteristische CT-Bild erlaubt bei einem Raucher im jüngeren Alter auch ohne eine bioptische Sicherung bei Fehlen sonstiger Pathologien die Diagnose einer Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose [30, 31].\", \"Unter den infektiösen Granulomatosen sind an erster Stelle die Tuberkulose und die nicht tuberkulösen Mykobakteriosen zu erwähnen [48].\", \"Eine immer noch große Rolle bei Screening, Erstdiagnose und Verlaufskontrolle der Tuberkulose spielt das konventionelle Röntgenbild [32]. Die CT besitzt jedoch sowohl eine höhere Sensitivität (bis zu 91 %) als auch einen höheren negativen prädiktiven Wert (bis zu 76 % [33]). Eine höhere Sensitivität zeigt sich insbesondere bei kleinen Befunden oder beim Nachweis von Komplikationen [39, 41]. In den seltenen Fällen einer chirurgischen Therapienotwendigkeit ist eine CT in der Planung unverzichtbar [42, 49, 52].\", \"Bezüglich Nomenklatur, Einteilung, Diagnostik und mögliche Manifestationen der Tuberkulose verweisen wir auf den gleichnamigen Artikel von Kienzl-Palma in Radiologe 2016;56:866–73. DOI 10.1007/s00117-016-0166-y.\", \"Die nicht tuberkulösen Mykobakteriosen (NTM) umfassen eine Gruppe von Erkrankungen, die von Mykobakterien verursacht werden, die nicht dem Mycobacterium-tuberculosis-Komplex und nicht M. leprae zugerechnet werden. Die Erreger sind in verschiedenen Umweltbereichen weit verbreitet. Oft handelt es sich um Patienten mit HIV-Infektion, Immunsuppression oder solche mit einer pulmonalen Grunderkrankung. Die Klinik ist unspezifisch und besteht v. a. in produktivem Husten, Hämoptysen, Fieber und Gewichtsverlust.

domesticus) and 25 fourteen-day-old turkey poults (Meleagris gallopavo) from the specific pathogen–free flock of the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center of The Ohio State University (Wooster, Ohio, USA). This flock has no prior exposure to swine or to PDCoV, PEDV, or TGEV. After acclimating in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facilities for 1 day, all birds appeared healthy with no evidence of diarrhea or other clinical signs. Animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.\", \"We determined PDCoV titers from intestinal contents of pigs by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay (23). We seeded LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cells at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate (BD Biosciences, https://www.bdbiosciences.com). We washed 100% confluent monolayers once with 200 µL of maintenance media (MM): minimal essential media (MEM), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), GlutaMAX (GIBCO, https://www.thermofisher.com) consisting of MEM with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% HEPES. We inoculated 100 µL from 10-fold dilutions of PDCoV in 8 replicates per dilution. Each plate included 1 row of negative control MM only with 5 µg/mL of Trypsin (Corning, https://www.corning.com). After absorption for 1 h, we added another 100 µL of MM with 5 µg/mL of Trypsin to each well. We monitored cytopathic effects for 3–7 days, calculated virus titers after immunofluorescent (IF) staining by using the Reed-Muench method (24), and expressed results as log10 TCID50/mL (23).\", \"Birds were floor housed in a temperature-controlled BSL-2 containment room with wood litter shavings and provided ad libitum access to food and water. In consecutive experiments of poults and chicks, we randomly divided the flock of 25 birds into 2 groups, 15 uninfected and 10 infected birds. Each group was housed separately and inoculated through the choanal cleft. The uninfected group was inoculated with 200 µL of unfiltered, undiluted small intestine contents (SIC) from an uninfected gnotobiotic pig (GP-8). The infected group was inoculated with SIC from a PDCoV-infected pig (DC175) with 6.87 log10 TCID50/mL. One poult in the uninfected group died of unknown causes unrelated to known pathogens before inoculation.\", \"After inoculation, we observed chicks and poults for clinical signs 2 times each day. We scored fecal consistency as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semiliquid; and 3, liquid (25). We considered a fecal consistency score of >2 as diarrhea. At 2 days postinoculation (dpi), we randomly assigned 5 birds from each uninfected group as sentinels and allowed them to comingle with the infected group for the duration of the experiment. We recorded body weights and collected cloacal swab, tracheal swab, and serum samples at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. Except for sentinel birds, we euthanized 2 chicks and 2 poults from each group at 3 and 7 dpi for blood and tissue collection. We concluded the study at 14 dpi and euthanized the remaining 33 birds, including sentinels, for blood and tissue collection.\", \"We modified and optimized an ELISA (26) to detect PDCoV-specific IgY antibodies in serum from PDCoV-inoculated chicks and poults. We added 50 µL of serum diluted 1:1,000 to the PDCoV antigen-coated and mock antigen-coated wells and incubated for 90 m at 37°C, then added 100 µL of biotin-conjugated antichicken IgY (Invitrogen Goat anti-Chicken IgY [H+L] Secondary Antibody, Biotin; ThermoFisher, https://www.thermofisher.com) or biotin-conjugated antiturkey IgY (Goat Anti-Turkey IgY (H+L) Biotin pAb; Cell Sciences, https://www.cellsciences.com) at a dilution of 1:10,000 and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. We added 100 µL of HRP-Conjugated Streptavidin (ThermoFisher) to each well at a dilution of 1:5,000 and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. We washed wells with phosphate buffered saline solution with 0.05% Tween-20 (×5) between each step. We added 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (SureBlue TMB 1-Component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate; Seracare, https://www.seracare.com), then added 100 µL of 0.3 mol/L sulfuric acid to stop the reaction. We read plates at an absorbance of 450 nm by using a SpectraMax F5 (Molecular Devices, https://www.moleculardevices.com) plate reader. We conducted statistical analysis by using Prism software (GraphPad, https://www.graphpad.com). We used analysis of variance to compare multiple groups and a 1-tailed Student t-test to compare groups of 2.\", \"We examined gross tissues from small intestines, duodenum to ileum, and large intestines, cecum and colon, as well as other organs, including bursa, lung, liver, kidney, proventriculus, and spleen, and then fixed tissues in 10% neutral formalin for 1–2 days at room temperature for histopathology (27). We embedded, sectioned, and then stained samples with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy examination. We measured mean jejunal or ileal ratios of villus height and crypt depth (VH:CD) by using MetaMorph software (MetaMorph, Inc., https://www.metamorphsoftware.com), as described previously (18). We tested prepared tissues by IF staining to detect PDCoV antigen using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against PDCoV (provided by E. Nelson, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, USA) (28). We also tested tissues from a PDCoV-infected pig for comparison.\", \"We suspended cloacal swabs, tracheal swabs, SIC, and large intestine contents (LIC) in 1–4 mL MEM as a 10% suspension. We extracted RNA by using GenCatch Viral RNA Miniprep Kit (Epoch Life Science, https://www.fishersci.com). We further processed samples containing fecal matter by using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research Corporation, https://www.zymoresearch.com). \", \"We determined viral RNA titers by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR), as reported previously (23). In brief, we amplified a 541-bp fragment of the M gene that covered the quantitative RT-PCR–amplified fragment. We designed 5′-CGCGTAATCGTGTGATCTATGT-3′ and 5′-CCGGCCTTTGAAGTGGTTAT-3′ primers according to the sequence of a strain from the United States, Illinois121/2014 (GenBank accession no. KJ481931). We purified the PCR products by using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagen.com), sequenced, and then used these as the template to construct a quantitative RT-PCR standard curve. The detection limit of the rRT-PCR was 10 genomic equivalents (GEs)/reaction, which corresponded to 4.6 log10 GE/mL of PDCoV in cloacal and tracheal samples.\", \"By 2 dpi, 70% of infected chicks had diarrhea and fecal scores >2; that percentage decreased to 17% by 9 dpi (Table 1). By 14 dpi, most (5/6) of the remaining infected chicks had normal feces. The 5 uninfected sentinel chicks that comingled with the infected birds at 2 dpi demonstrated mild to moderate diarrhea 2 days after comingling (4 dpi); diarrhea peaked 5 days after comingling (7 dpi). At 14 dpi, only 2 sentinel chicks had abnormal feces. Two chicks in the uninfected group had transient diarrhea during the study but tested negative for known pathogens, including PDCoV.\", \"In poults, 50% exhibited diarrhea at 2 dpi. During the study, the rate of diarrhea increased, and poults did not recover by 14 dpi. (Table 1). Sentinel poults began exhibiting mild to moderate diarrhea 5 days after comingling (7 dpi), and by 9 dpi, 60% were affected. At 14 dpi, all 5 sentinel poults had moderate diarrhea. \", \"Two infected chicks necropsied at 3 dpi had distended gastrointestinal tracts containing a mixture of yellow liquid and gas. Similar but less extensive findings were seen in infected chicks at 7 dpi. No gross pathology was detected in infected chicks or sentinel chicks at 14 dpi. In necropsies of infected poults, we observed distended gastrointestinal tracts containing a mixture of yellow liquid and gas at all time points.\", \"Birds were weighed before inoculation and then at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. PDCoV infection greatly affected the chicks’ weight at 2 dpi (Figure 1, panel A). At 4 and 7 dpi, weight gain averages in infected chicks were comparable to those in uninfected birds, but at 9 and 11 dpi, infected chicks had gained much less weight than the uninfected chicks. By 14 dpi, infected chicks rebounded and showed compensatory weight gain at higher levels than uninfected chicks.\", \"Poult weight gain responses differed from those of the chicks. At 2 dpi, infected poults were gaining weight at a much higher rate than uninfected poults (Figure 1, panel B). However, by 4 dpi, poult weight gain was severely curtailed; several lost weight, and the average weight gain for the infected group was 0.5 g, compared with almost 10 g for uninfected poults. By 7 dpi, the infected poults recovered and gained weight at a slightly higher, but not statistically significantly different, rate than the uninfected poults. This trend continued until the end of the study.\", \"We examined tissue sections by using light microscopy. We noted suspect zymogen depletion in several poults in both the infected and uninfected groups, suggesting possible inanition. We conducted VH:CD measurements of the ileum and jejunum of intestinal tissues from chicks at 14 dpi (Table 2). Infected chicks had a VH:CD ratio of 4.26:1 compared with a ratio of 6.15:1 for uninfected chicks. The VH:CD ratio was lower in sentinel chicks than in uninfected chicks but the difference was not statistically significant. \", \"We could not obtain enough measurements for poult tissues to provide accurate comparisons. IF tissue staining in infected poults demonstrated PDCoV antigen detectable in the epithelial cells lining the villi of the jejunum, although at reduced levels from the ileum and from infected porcine tissue (Figure 2, panel A). We also detected PDCoV antigen in numerous epithelial cells that had sloughed off and remained in the lumen of infected poults when compared with stained tissue sections from uninfected poults (Figure 2, panel B and C). We were unable to visualize a signal in tissues from chicks.\", \"We analyzed serum samples collected at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. We used indirect ELISA to test samples at 2 and 14 dpi for PDCoV-specific IgY antibodies in all birds from each group, including sentinel birds. We assigned experimental values by averaging 3 replicates. Because we did not have positive controls in chicks and poults, we established a cutoff by using the average final optical density value of uninfected birds at 2 dpi plus 2 SD. We established a separate cutoff value for sentinel birds.\", \"At 14 dpi, infected chicks had increased IgY antibody levels in serum, demonstrating an antibody response to PDCoV (Figure 3, panel A), but sentinel chicks did not have antibody levels demonstrating exposure to PDCoV (Figure 3, panel B). Serum samples from poults exhibited a similar range of IgY values. The average IgY values were much higher in infected birds at 14 dpi compared with infected birds at 2 dpi and uninfected birds (Figure 3, panel C). The IgY greatly increased in sentinel poults at 14 dpi compared with IgY values at 2 dpi, but were still below the cutoff value (Figure 3, panel D).\", \"All experimentally infected chicks rapidly shed detectable viral RNA postinoculation, and viral RNA titers remained relatively constant through 11 dpi (Figure 4, panels A, B). Viral RNA from cloacal swabs reached 6.52 log10 GE/mL by 2 dpi and remained >6.5 log10 GE/mL until 11 dpi, when levels at 7.14 log10 GE/mL at 9 dpi, then decreased to 5.82 log10 GE/mL at 14 dpi. Despite an absence of noticeable respiratory signs, tracheal swab specimens also showed high levels of PDCoV RNA throughout the study (Figure 4, panel B). PDCoV spread rapidly from infected to naive birds, and all 5 sentinel chicks became positive for PDCoV RNA in both tracheal and cloacal swabs within 2 days of comingling with infected birds (Figure 4, panels C, D).\", \"We calculated titers and viral RNA loads in SIC and LIC from infected and sentinel chicks at 3, 7, and 14 dpi (Figure 5). We used RNA isolated at 14 dpi from SIC of 1 infected and 1 sentinel bird to amplify an ≈1,300-bp portion of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PDCoV, then gel extracted and sequenced the resulting product. The samples sequenced had >99% identity with the original inoculum, Ohio FD22 strain of PDCoV. We tested infectivity of intestinal contents of infected and sentinel chicks by using TCID50 assay at 7 and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel A).\", \"Similar to the results from chicks, results for infected poults showed all had high levels of PDCoV RNA in cloacal and tracheal swabs through 14 dpi (Figure 6, panels A, B). Poults appeared to have higher initial viral loads, averaging 8.07 log10 GE/mL by 2 dpi, decreasing to ≈6 log10 GE/mL at 4 dpi, and persisting through 14 dpi (Figure 6, panel A). Naive birds also were susceptible to infection, and cloacal and tracheal swab specimens from all sentinel poults were positive for PDCoV RNA within 2 days after comingling with infected poults (Figure 6, panels C, D, E). We calculated titers and viral RNA loads in SIC and LIC from infected and sentinel poults at 3, 7, and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel B). We tested infectivity of intestinal contents of infected and sentinel poults by using TCID50 assay at 7 and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel B).\", \"We isolated viral RNA from the SIC of 1 infected and 1 sentinel bird at 14 dpi and used it to amplify an ≈1,300-bp portion of the N gene of PDCoV, then gel extracted and sequenced the resulting product. As we noted in chicks, the samples sequenced had >99% identity with the original inoculum, the Ohio FD22 strain of PDCoV.\", \"Emerging viruses in at least 2 genera of porcine CoVs have exhibited increased propensity for interspecies transmission (2,29). Porcine APN was identified as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV (19,30). APN is a protein that exhibits enzymatic activity, peptide processing, cholesterol uptake, and chemotaxis to cell signaling and cell adhesion (31). APN is widely distributed and highly conserved in amino acid sequences across species of the Animalia kingdom (19) and is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including epithelial cells of the kidneys (31), respiratory tract (32,33), and gastrointestinal tract (34).\", \"Our data suggest that chicks and poults are susceptible to infection with PDCoV. In addition, the rapid transmission of PDCoV to the sentinel birds that comingled with infected birds demonstrates that the virus could spread easily. The length of our pilot study did not allow us to determine how long the chicks and poults would be affected by PDCoV or how long they might shed viral RNA. The chicks appeared to recover more rapidly than poults; clinical signs diminished or were completely absent by 14 dpi. However, chicks still were shedding low viral RNA titers at 14 dpi. Poults did not recover by the end of the study and still exhibited gross pathology and mild to moderate diarrhea. PDCoV RNA shedding titers were higher in poults than in the chicks. Cloacal shedding titers in chicks peaked at 9 dpi and then decreased. In poults, cloacal viral RNA shedding titers were multiphasic, peaking at 2 dpi, with additional smaller peaks at 9 and 14 dpi. The rapid onset of viral RNA shedding correlates with previous in vitro data in which the PDCoV S1 domain bound most efficiently to APN of galline origin (19) and cytopathic effects were observed more rapidly in leghorn male hepatoma and DF1 chicken cell lines compared with swine testicular cells (S.P. Kenney, unpub. data).\", \"ELISA results showed that both chicks and poults developed PDCoV antibodies by 14 dpi. Pig infection dynamics have demonstrated a similar serum neutralizing antibody titer increase at 7–14 days (12,23). Sentinel birds had low or undetectable antibody responses compared with experimentally challenged birds, likely because of the passive infection method and because less time passed between exposure to the virus and the end of the study.\", \"Recent studies demonstrated that PDCoV can infect and kill cells of other species through APN receptors (19,35). PDCoV has been reported to infect commercial chickens in vivo (36). The differences in susceptibility to PDCoV infection between chicks and poults we observed could be related to differences in APN expression levels between the species. \", \"The true incidence rates for PDCoV infection, natural host range, reservoirs, and routes of transmission are still relatively unknown, and no plans for vaccine development have been reported (37). DCoV RNA has been detected in fecal samples from wild birds (38,39), Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata), and leopard cats (40). In addition to swine, calves have been shown by experimental testing to be susceptible to PDCoV infection (41). These data, coupled with the PDCoV binding receptor APN being conserved across many species, suggest that the host range for PDCoV is broader than initially expected (19). The close sequence homology between DCoV isolates from mammalian and wild bird species implies a transmission cycle in which PDCoV regularly crosses from wild birds and mammals into animal production systems, including the swine and poultry industries. More epidemiologic data are required to understand the full extent to which DCoVs are threatening food production systems and whether they pose a direct threat to human health. \", \"Our results are consistent with the likelihood that avian species act as potential passthrough or intermediate hosts for PDCoV. In vivo confirmation of avian susceptibility to PDCoV suggests that in vitro data implicating human susceptibility should be evaluated further. Research regarding how PDCoV is adapting and mutating in different species and whether it infects humans is critical to determining if PDCoV poses a pandemic health risk to commercial poultry or humans.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2602.190346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31961296/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7172267\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/j.jcv.2008.12.007\",\n  title: \"Human polyomaviruses, WU and KI in HIV exposed children with acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitals in South Africa\",\n  doc_date: \"2009-03-31\",\n  authors: [\"Marietjie.Venter\", \"Adele.Visser\", \"Ria.Lassauniere\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Specimen collection ::: Materials and methods\", \"HIV testing ::: Materials and methods\", \"Extraction and amplification ::: Materials and methods\", \"Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis ::: Materials and methods\", \"Detection of co-infections ::: Materials and methods\", \"Prevalence of WUV and KIV ::: Results\", \"Prevalence of WUV and KIV ::: Results\", \"Prevalence of WUV and KIV ::: Results\", \"Prevalence of WUV and KIV ::: Results\", \"Prevalence of WUV and KIV ::: Results\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"abstract\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"WU (WUV) and KI (KIV) polyomaviruses were recently identified in respiratory specimens from patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI).1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 WUV was present in respiratory secretions of 1–3% of cases of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) in children in Australia, the USA,1 Canada,4 Great Britain,5, 12 and China11; 3.2–8.1% in Germany10; 6.2% in Thailand13; and 7% in South Korea.6 KIV was detected in 1% of cases in Sweden.3 Australia,2 Great Britain,5, 12 China,11 and 2% in Thailand.13 Co-infections were identified in >50% of cases and a similar frequency were identified in hospitalised patients without symptoms in Canada and Scotland.4, 12 A higher frequency of co-infection was noted in symptomatic (7%) as compared with asymptomatic (4.2%) children in South Korea, although this finding was not statistically significant.6 Although this places the disease association of WUV and KIV in question in immunocompetent children, their role as pathogens in immunocompromised children, especially those with HIV/AIDS remains unknown.\", \"Previously, JC and BK virus (JCV and BKV) were the only polyomaviruses considered as undisputed human pathogens.14 Both cause latent and asymptomatic infections in the majority of people, but may cause serious disease in immunocompromised individuals.15, 16 Specific JCV genotypes are associated with specific populations and certain genotypes are identified more frequently in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) cases.17, 18, 19, 20, 21\\n\", \"The HIV sero-prevalence amongst antenatal clinic attendees in the Gauteng province, Republic of South Africa (RSA) was 32.4% by 2005.22 The important role that JCV and BKV play in mortality in HIV-infected patients raises questions about the role of WUV and KIV in respiratory tract disease in HIV-infected children.\", \"To address this, nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with respiratory disease from South Africa, were screened for WUV and KIV by PCR over a period of 1 year.

Healthy control specimens from 50 children attending a vaccine clinic in the same region were included. The control group was only tested for WUV and KIV. Disease severity was classified as: mild (upper respiratory tract infections, seeking medical care at outpatients); moderate (LRTI, requiring hospitalisation); or severe (LRTI, admission to the intensive care unit or oxygen dependent). Negative specimens were selected randomly each month for inclusion in this study.\", \"HIV-1 was detected by HIV Ag/Ab Combo Assay (Abbott, Santa Clara, CA) followed by either a HIV-1 DNA Amplicor assay version 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics) for patients <18 months of age or a 4th generation ELISA (Roche diagnostics) in older patients.23 Polyomavirus-positive specimens of unknown status were retrospectively tested by HIV-1 DNA PCR assay on DNA obtained from NPA cell pellets.24, 25, 26 Specimen quality was monitored using an internal control. All specimens in the database were blinded and handled anonymously.\", \"Nucleic acids were extracted with the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit, Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). PCR screening was carried out using the Expand High Fidelity PLUS PCR System, Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany).1, 3 WUV and KIV amplicons were 250 bp (VP2) and 323 bp (VP1) in size, respectively.\", \"DNA sequencing of positive amplicons was carried out as recommended by the supplier using the ABI Prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit Version 3.1 on an ABI 3130 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequence editing was performed with SequencherTM Version 4.6, Gene Codes Corporation (Ann Arbor, USA). Nucleotide sequences were aligned with Clustal X (1.8).27 Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the VP1 region for KIV and the VP2 region for WUV.1, 2, 3 Maximum-likelihood trees were created using DNAML version 3.573c of Phylip28 using optimised transition to transversion ratios and base frequencies. Bootstrap statistics was calculated from a Neighbor-Joining consensus tree using 1000 replicates and the maximum-likelihood model. Trees were midpoint rooted in Figtree V1.1.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac za). Percentage nucleic acid and amino acid differences were calculated using the P-distance option of MEGA version 4.29\\n\", \"WUV- and KIV-positive specimens were screened for co-infections by a newly developed multiplex realtime RT-PCR for RSV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus, human coronaviruses NL63 (CoVNL63), CoV229E, CoVOC43, HKU1, PIV 1,2,3, adenovirus, influenza A and B, and rhinovirus (RV) thereby covering both newly identified respiratory viruses and viruses not commonly included in routine respiratory virus tests, as well as viruses included in conventional tests. Screening all specimens by PCR eliminated the bias of immunofluorescence testing, which requires high quality specimens with intact cells. Details of this tests will be reported elsewhere (Lassauniere and Venter, unpublished data).\", \"Patients were between 0 days and 77 years old with 98.7% being <2 years (mean age = 3 months) and 45% female. This was representative of the demographics of patient specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis over a one-year period to the virology laboratory. In total 21/300 specimens were positive for WUV (7%) and 3 for KIV (1%). Co-infections were identified in 15/21 (71%) and 2/3 of WUV- and KIV-positive specimens, respectively. Most co-infections were with RV (6/21), followed by bocavirus (3/21), and adenovirus, RSV, PIV3 and influenza A (2/21 each); CoVNL63 and hPMV were each identified in one case. No CoVOC43, −229E or HKU1 co-infections were identified. Bacterial co-infections were identified in three cases (Table 1\\n). KIV-positive specimens were also positive for WUV in 2/3 cases. No seasonality was observed. None of the 50 healthy patients tested positive for WUV or KIV.\", \"Nine of 21 (42%) WUV- and 1/3 KIV-infected patients were HIV-positive. The HIV status was unknown in a majority of cases (47.69%). Retrospective anonymous screening by DNA PCR on NPA cell pellets increased the WUV/HIV-positive group by 14% to 12/21 (57.1%) (Table 1). HIV DNA PCR results on NPAs correlated with known HIV PCR positive blood tests. HIV infection in WUV-positive patients was more common than in the screened patient group (57.1% vs 33%), although not statistically significant (Fisher's exact test; P\\n = 0.10 at a 95% confidence interval).\", \"Seventy-one percent of WUV-infected patients were <1-year old, although an infection was detected in an HIV-positive patient of 40 years. No gender association was found for either virus infection. Clinical presentation ranged from mild to severe, presenting as RSV-like disease, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and broncho-pneumonia (Table 1A). Clinical symptoms similar to pneumocystis jerovecii pneumonia (PCP) were diagnosed in three cases despite negative IFA on NPA's for PCP. Two of these cases had no other infecting agent identified, while the third was co-infected with RV. All three had moderate to severe disease, required hospitalisation, and had AIDS. All HIV-positive patients infected with WUV were classified with moderate and severe disease.\", \"Ten WUV sequence products were of sufficient quality to use for phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide alignments identified five distinct RSA strains. Comparison of the RSA strains to all available WU partial VP2 sequences on Genbank clustered existing strains into four genotypes that were named genotypes 1–4 for this study on the basis of bootstrap and p-distance analysis. Representative sequences of each unique strain in Genbank were included in the tree in Fig. 1\\n. Genotypes differed on average between 1.3% and 3.6% to each other and less than 1.3% within groups (results not shown). Most RSA WU strains clustered with genotype 1, which could be subdivided into five subgenotypes (1a–1e). Nineteen variable sites were identified across the 250 bp VP2 gene region (Fig. 2\\n). Most nucleotide differences between the main genotypes translated into amino acid changes (2.1–7% average amino acid difference between genotypes) (Fig. 2B). RSA isolates in subgenotypes 1b, 1c and genotype 2 were unique and differed from all other strains. Strain B2 had a deletion of 12 nucleotides (translating into five amino acids) that was not present in the RSA genotype 2 strain (SAW526524) and was not visible in the alignment. RSA genotype 1d strains differed by one amino acid from genotype 1b, 1c, and 1e strains, which were identical at amino acid level. RSA strains in subgenotype 1e and 1d were identical to strains identified in Australia, the USA and Korea (Fig. 2). No correlation seems to exist between disease severity and genotype, but this should be confirmed with larger sample sizes.\", \"Nucleotide sequence of the VP1 region of RSA KIV strains was 100% identical to strains identified in Sweden and Australia.\", \"This study confirms the presence of WUV and KIV in respiratory secretions of children with mild to severe respiratory infection symptoms in Africa. The frequencies of WUV (7%) was higher than those detected in Scotland12; Australia, the USA and Canada,1, 4 but similar to levels in Thailand13 and Germany.10 The only study including immunocompromised patients, which was performed in Scotland, had very limited numbers of patients with advanced HIV disease. HIV infection was more prevalent in WUV-positive patients (57%) as compared with the overall respiratory virus patient group screened in the present study (33%), although not yet statistically significant due to the small sample size. Too few KIV-positive patients were identified to draw any conclusion about HIV prevalence. The low number of detected KIV-positive cases (1%) does not suggest a significant role in either HIV-positive or HIV-negative patients. Although immunocompromised patients were identified among WUV-positive patients from Australia, and the USA, very few HIV-infected patients were included. The immune status of children in Thailand or Germany was not clear.10, 13 Fifty healthy volunteers were all negative for WUV and KIV suggesting an absence of these viruses in healthy immunocompetent children. Despite the small number of specimens in this control group, they represent truly healthy children rather than hospitalised patients that may be more susceptible to infections. WUV-positive control patients in previous studies were all immunosuppressed or hospitalised for other reasons.4, 12 Larger control groups of children without respiratory disease that are immunocompetent and immunosuppressed may shed further light on WUV disease association.\", \"Most HIV-positive RSA patients with WUV had moderate to severe disease with symptoms ranging from pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, and PCP-like pneumonia. This may be due to the immunosuppression as seen in HIV disease, but may also be linked to the increased incidence of co-infections, compounding clinical severity. Patients with mild disease were mostly HIV-negative, but again due to limited patient numbers, this finding was not statistically significant. Co-infections were identified in 71% of WUV-infected patients in our study group, relative to Germany (54.8%), Thailand (43%), Australia (79.7%), and the USA (71%). Two patients had co-infections with both WUV and KIV, one that was HIV-negative with a bocavirus co-infection had mild disease, while the other had stage 4 AIDS with moderate disease, and a co-infection with rhinovirus and symptoms similar to PCP-like pneumonia. Further investigations are needed to determine if these polyomaviruses contribute to respiratory syndromes in young patients with AIDS.\", \"Comparison of our data to populations without significant HIV burden does not indicate a greater infection rate in immunocompetent relative to immunosuppressed children. However, 71% of cases were associated with ALRI in RSA vs 56% in Germany which may possibly be due to the higher HIV sero-prevalence. The range of co-infections was also similar, but may increase the severity of disease in immunosuppressed patients although this should be confirmed in larger studies.\", \"Identification of WUV in a one-day old child complements similar findings in the USA.7\\n\", \"Phylogenetic analysis of strains from 5 continents has identified at least 4 major WUV genotypes. WUV genotype 1 is the most widely distributed and is present in Australia, Africa, Europe and Asia, while genotype 4 is specific to China. Genotype 1 was the most abundant in our study group and was identified in patients with mild to severe disease. Larger study cohorts will determine if a statistical significant disease association can be attributed to specific genotypes.\", \"The frequent identification of WUV with co-infections in pediatric HIV patients with lower respiratory tract infections in hospitals in RSA warrant further investigations to determine if WUV contribute to disease in AIDS patients.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653208004678; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19171499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653208004678\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7264578\",\n  doi: \"10.1002/hed.26166\",\n  title: \"Tracheostomy during SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic: Recommendations from the New York Head and Neck Society\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-04-20\",\n  authors: [\"Brett.Miles\", \"Bradley.Schiff\", \"Ian.Ganly\", \"Thomas.Ow\", \"Erik.Cohen\", \"Eric.Genden\", \"Bruce.Culliney\", \"Bhoomi.Mehrotra\", \"Steven.Savona\", \"Richard.Wong\", \"Missak.Haigentz\", \"Salvatore.Caruana\", \"Babak.Givi\", \"Kepal.Patel\", \"Kenneth.Hu\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"BACKGROUND\", \"BACKGROUND\", \"BACKGROUND\", \"Monitor endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuff pressures every Q4 hours ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Monitor endotracheal and tracheostomy tube cuff pressures every Q4 hours ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Delay timing of tracheostomy until 21 days after the onset of symptoms if feasible ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Delay timing of tracheostomy until 21 days after the onset of symptoms if feasible ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Tracheostomy technical considerations and recommendations ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Tracheostomy technical considerations and recommendations ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Use of appropriate PPE during tracheostomy procedures for active SARS‐CoV‐2 ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Use of appropriate PPE during tracheostomy procedures for active SARS‐CoV‐2 ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Avoid emergent tracheostomy if possible ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Appropriate posttracheostomy management ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Organize an appropriate team ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"Organize an appropriate team ::: RECOMMENDATIONS\", \"CONCLUSION\", \"SUMMARY POINTS\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\", \"RESOURCES\"],\n      generic: [\"references\", \"references\", \"references\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"related-works\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"The rapid spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in 2019 and 2020 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic.1, 2, 3, 4 The dramatic proinflammatory effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 result in a wide variety of clinical presentations; however, severe pulmonary inflammation, effusions and rapid respiratory compromise are a hallmark of this disease.5, 6, 7 Subsequent pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death have been reported not infrequently. The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Certainly, the rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months.14, 15\\n\", \"Although a generally well‐tolerated and safe procedure, the risks and benefits of tracheostomy in terms of outcomes, pulmonary care and risks to the health care team remain unknown.16, 17 Fortunately, although not perfect, rapid testing protocols have allowed us to be able to detect active infection in patients who are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2.18, 19, 20, 21 What is clear is that the upper aerodigestive tract, the nasopharynx and the trachea harbor a high viral load during the acute stages of the infection.22, 23, 24 Therefore, performing a tracheostomy in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers. The risk of this procedure has to be balanced with the known risks of prolonged intubation, primarily tracheal and subglottic stenosis, the management of which can be problematic if significant mucosal injury and subsequent stenosis occur.\", \"The New York Head and Neck Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1979, which encourages the exchange and advancement of scientific knowledge relative to the management of head and neck cancer and includes several member institutions, including Columbia University Medical Center, Cornell Medical College, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York University Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and has several other affiliate institutions in the greater New York City area. The New York Head and Neck Society has collaborated on this document to provide guidance on the performance of tracheostomy during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.\", \"In patients who are intubated, especially in prolonged intubations >72 hours, the risk of tracheal stenosis increases over time. Teams managing these patients should stress that all intubated patients have a Q4‐hour cuff pressure check with a goal of approximately 30 cm H2O if feasible, given the vent parameter requirements, as pressures higher than 30 cm H2O may result in pressure necrosis. Certainly, adequate pressure to avoid cuff leakage and aerosolization is critical when managing SARS‐CoV‐2 patients, but it should be recognized that unnecessarily high cuff pressures are also problematic. The minimum cuff pressure required to create an adequate seal should be individualized for each patient and verified frequently by care providers. Certainly, high peak pressures, or issues with ventilation may make the appropriate cuff pressure a moving target. This is a dynamic process, and frequent adjustments may be indicated depending on ventilation parameters. Prevention of tracheal mucosal pressure necrosis, resulting tracheal and cricoid chondritis and subsequent stenosis is critical in the SARS‐CoV‐2 population.25, 26\\n\", \"SARS‐CoV‐2 testing via the reverse transcription‐ polymerase chain reaction (rt‐PCR) detection platform for SARS‐CoV‐2 and pan‐sarbecovirus detection is recommended for all patients who are being considered for tracheostomy. It should be remembered that data surrounding accuracy of the test during the pandemic is forthcoming, and false negatives are a real possibility.\\n27\\n In addition, rt‐PCR may not be reliable when determining infectivity/active virus vs the mere presence of viral DNA and therefore while levels detected by rt‐PCR do tend to correlate with the active viral load, robust data are lacking to support the utilization of a testing protocol for viral load and decision making in SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients. The test may be performed a second time if clinical suspicion or institutional policy warrants repeat testing for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 prior to high‐risk procedures.\", \"When determining the appropriate time of tracheostomy in the SARS‐CoV‐2 patient, several factors are considered, and individual cases may certainly have mitigating circumstances that lead to the decision to perform tracheostomy. However, for the majority of patients, health care teams should seek to capitalize on the intersection of the risk of contamination/infection and decreasing viral load in the upper and lower airways over time with the risks of prolonged intubation (ie, tracheal stenosis, weaning issues, pulmonary toilet, etc.). Although the overall risk of tracheal stenosis secondary to prolonged intubation depends on a variety of factors, reported rates of severe, symptomatic stenosis are generally in the 1% to 2% range when modern low‐pressure cuffs are utilized.28, 29, 30, 31, 32 Therefore, in light of the relatively low risk of clinically relevant stenosis, and despite the traditional 10‐day cutoff for increased stenosis risk used by many practitioners in the general population, when dealing with a SARS‐CoV‐2 patient, the risk for symptomatic or severe tracheal stenosis is acceptable in light of the significant risks of tracheostomy in the acute phase of the infection during periods of the highest viral loads. The decreasing viral load, although logarithmic in nature, is somewhat variable, and high viral loads have been observed somewhat late in the course of the infection in critically ill patients (Figures 1 and 2).23, 24, 33 Therefore, when feasible, waiting until approximately 21 days after the onset of symptoms is recommended prior to consideration of tracheostomy for the majority of cases in order to avoid exposing health care teams to increased risk. Earlier tracheostomy may certainly be medically indicated in some situations depending on the clinical situation, or health care system issues during a pandemic situation, and we recognize the potential need to perform tracheostomy more urgently. Tracheostomy should not be delayed regardless of SARS‐CoV‐2 status in life‐saving situations or in situations in which the tracheostomy would significantly improve the prognosis of the patient. Certainly the timing of tracheostomy remains a controversial issue and data is limited related to SARS‐CoV‐2.\\n53\\n Alternative emerging strategies in the management of SARS‐CoV‐2 critically ill patients, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, antiviral therapy and convalescent plasma therapy, may also be considered by the team, but the available data and decision making regarding this is beyond the scope of these recommendations.34, 35, 36, 37, 38 Clearly, these are multidisciplinary decisions that will be individualized depending on the patient and institutional expertise.\", \"In addition, it should be noted that avoiding tracheostomy in patients at high risk of mortality is critical. If the primary team managing the patient determines that there is an extremely high risk of mortality in the near future or that the patient has a high likelihood of withdrawal of care, the risks of tracheostomy should be avoided in this situation. Patients with significant medical comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome/severe respiratory failure and a low chance of recovery who are infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 should be carefully evaluated, and discussions with family members, consultants, institutional ethics committees and the treating team should focus on overall prognosis and goals of care prior to performing tracheostomy as a routine matter of care. These decisions are highly individualized and rely on solid communication among team members managing these high‐risk patients.\", \"Although the exact technical details regarding tracheostomy will depend on the situation and procedural protocols and technical expertise, there are some specific technical aspects related to the SARS‐CoV‐2 (and other viral pandemics) that should be considered. Ideally, the procedure should be performed at bedside in the intensive care unit in a negative pressure room or using a portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration system to avoid patient transportation and contamination of other areas in the medical center. If it is necessary to perform the procedure in the operating room (OR), a specific OR cluster should be designated to avoid contamination of additional OR resources for noninfected patients. In addition to standard airborne and droplet precautions, techniques to minimize aerosolization of the virus during the procedure include the following: paralysis to prevent coughing; consider glycopyrrolate to reduce secretions; preoxygenation and cessation of ventilation during the tracheostomy procedure; utilization of closed suctioning systems; avoiding monopolar electrocautery, or harmonic technology, and using cold instrumentation when feasible; minimizing suctioning and bronchoscopy during the procedure; and ensuring the cuff is inflated prior to resuming ventilation, so the circuit is closed.\", \"In addition to standard open tracheostomy with an apneic technique, percutaneous/dilational tracheostomy techniques have been evaluated extensively in the literature and have been shown to be a safe alternative to traditional open surgical tracheostomy.39, 40, 41 Understandably, the techniques utilized when performing tracheostomy will vary based on patient characteristics, provider expertise and institutional experience. Although data are limited, techniques that avoid opening the airway and are closed, such as a percutaneous dilational technique, may be preferential in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.42, 43 Therefore, if there are no anatomical or other contraindications, percutaneous dilational tracheostomy may be considered if the expertise is available. It should be remembered that the decrease in aerosolization during percutaneous tracheostomy only holds true if airway manipulation (ie, bronchoscopy with cuff deflation or concurrent ventilation) is not performed, and although there have been some associated higher complication rates with blind percutaneous tracheostomy compared to bronchoscopic technique, ultrasound‐guided techniques have been shown to be noninferior to bronchoscopic techniques.44, 45, 46 Therefore, when considering a percutaneous tracheostomy, a closed ultrasound‐guided or “cuff‐up” apneic technique is recommended for SARS‐CoV‐2 patients.\", \"Although there are limited data on the current pandemic to fully inform personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, performing tracheostomy in an actively infected SARS‐CoV‐2 patient is certainly a high‐risk procedure for health care workers.\\n47\\n Health care personnel performing the tracheostomy should wear at minimum: waterproof cap, goggles with an antimist screen, impermeable operating room surgeon's gown and gloves and a transparent plastic facial shield worn outside the goggles and N95 that is effective in filtering 99.5% particles larger than 0.75 μm and 95% effective in the .1 to .3 μm range.\\n48\\n The minimum number of health care workers required to perform the procedure should be present to prevent unnecessary exposures.\", \"The effectiveness of the N95 mask in the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection during tracheostomy procedures remains unknown, but given the high risk and the reported size of thevirus ranging from 70‐90 nm, consideration for power air‐purifying respirator (PAPR) systems for personnel performing tracheostomy should be entertained.\\n54\\n These systems should be used when available in situations of acute active infection, or suspicion of high viral loads, as there is some evidence of superior protection (PAPR provides 2.5‐100 times greater protection than the N95 when staff are appropriately trained).47, 49, 50 The effectiveness of N95 and PAPR in this situation has certainly not been compared in a head‐to‐head trial, and therefore, the use of PAPR vs N95 will depend on institutional resources and policy and the clinical situation until further data is available.\", \"Techniques to manage the acute airway with endotracheal intubation, video laryngoscope for example, should be utilized if possible to avoid emergent tracheostomy in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients due to the high risk of unsafe conditions and health care worker contaminations.\\n48\\n Similarly, intubation techniques (ie, rapid sequence intubation) that avoid mask ventilation, such as prolonged open airway manipulation, are recommended when appropriate. When life‐threatening airway obstruction occurs in a setting in which intubation is not possible, health care workers should perform the tracheostomy with the above‐noted PPE, keeping in mind that PAPR respirator use is often not feasible or available in emergent situations. In situations in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation is being performed, chest compressions should be avoided at the time the airway is entered until the airway is secured and the cuff is inflated on the device to minimize health care worker exposure.\", \"Posttracheostomy management should also be mentioned as, in addition to routine tracheostomy care, there are some considerations for SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. Securing circuits properly and avoiding unnecessary humidification systems may reduce the risk of unexpected circuit disconnection and aerosolization leading to exposure. The circuit should remain closed as much as possible, and closed‐line suctioning should be used. Heat moister exchangers with viral filters and HEPA filtration should be used when possible. Tracheostomy tube changes should be avoided and should only be performed in cases of cuff failure or emergent situations.\", \"Although the members of the health care team performing tracheostomy vary across institutions, team members may include surgeons, medicine/intensivists, anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists, nurses and other ancillary staff required during these procedures. The importance of appropriate PPE/PAPR training and usage cannot be overstated in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Teams that perform the procedure regularly will be more efficient and less likely to be unfamiliar with the procedure or appropriate health care protective measures and infection control. The inclusion of trainees such as residents and fellows during these procedures requires careful consideration and will vary based on institutional policies.\", \"Currently, there are limited data on the host innate immune status of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients.\\n51\\n Consideration of the inclusion of health care workers who have previously been exposed and subsequently recovered from documented SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may be warranted. Although the exact timing of immunity and subsequent safety for the return of health care providers infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 remains unknown, sufficient antibody responses have been documented to occur between 15 and 20 days, or approximately 2 weeks, after the onset of symptoms (Figure 3).\\n23\\n Inclusion of these individuals on these teams may allow for high‐risk procedures to be performed by health care workers who have mounted an immune response to the virus depending on institutional quarantine policies. Similarly, these individuals should not be involved in tracheostomy procedures or other airway procedures in noninfected patients due to the risk of iatrogenic infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 due to limited available data about the risks.\\n52\\n\\n\", \"Tracheostomy in the SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patient represents a unique situation, with a unique set of risks and implications. When compared to traditional tracheostomy procedures in the setting of prolonged ventilation, SARS‐CoV‐2 represents a unique entity in terms of timing, indications and infection control considerations that must be remembered when performing these procedures and managing patient's posttracheostomy. Additional resources are listed below.\", \"\\nCareful consideration of “who” and “when” when tracheostomy is planned is recommended.Careful consideration of the location and technique to avoid unnecessary risks to health care providers is recommended.When clinically appropriate, delay of tracheostomy procedures is recommended to allow for reduced viral load and to decrease the risk of nosocomial infection to critical health care providers.Selecting appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT), and careful monitoring of ETT cuff pressures to maintain appropriate seal to avoid aerosolization when mitigating the risk of long‐term tracheal complications is recommended.Appropriate PPE training and utilization, including N95 or PAPR when indicated, is recommended for all patients undergoing tracheostomy, regardless of SARS‐CoV‐2 status, during the pandemic.Avoidance of unnecessary airway manipulation, such as ventilation during bronchoscopy; routine trach changes, with a focus on a closed‐circuit ventilation; and utilizing apneic open tracheotomy/bronchoscopy or ultrasound guidance for percutaneous tracheostomy, is recommended.\\n\", \"American Academy of Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery.\", \"Tracheostomy Recommendations during COVID‐19 Pandemic.\", \"\\nhttps://www.entnet.org/content/tracheotomy-recommendations-during-covid-19-pandemic\\n\", \"American Head and Neck Society Guidance for Tracheostomy during COVID‐19 Pandemic.\", \"\\nhttps://www.ahns.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Guidance-for-Surgical-Tracheostomy-and-Tracheostomy-Tube-Change-during-the-COVID.pdf\\n\", \"Percutaneous Tracheostomy Technique:\", \"\\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/tracheostomy/about/how.html\\n\", \"\\nhttps://www.vumc.org/trauma-and-scc/sites/vumc.org.trauma-and-scc/files/public_files/Protocols/Tracheostomy%202019.pdf\\n\", \"Open Tracheostomy Technique:\", \"\\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/tracheostomy/about/pac-20384673\\n\", \"\\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17568-tracheostomy-care\\n\", \"\\nhttps://medicine.uiowa.edu/iowaprotocols/tracheotomy-tracheostomy\\n\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304119/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26166\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7107314\",\n  doi: \"10.1093/infdis/jis573\",\n  title: \"Viral Etiology of Influenza-Like Illnesses in Cameroon, January–December 2009\",\n  doc_date: \"2012-12-15\",\n  authors: [\"Richard.Njouom\", \"Elsie.Yekwa\", \"Pierre.Cappy\", \"Astrid.Vabret\", \"Pascal.Boisier\", \"Dominique.Rousset\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Study Design and Settings ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Study Design and Settings ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Study Design and Settings ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Study Design and Settings ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Sample Collection and Laboratory Procedures ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Sample Collection and Laboratory Procedures ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Sample Collection and Laboratory Procedures ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Sample Collection and Laboratory Procedures ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Sample Collection and Laboratory Procedures ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Data Management and Statistical Analysis ::: MATERIALS AND METHODS\", \"Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With ILI ::: RESULTS\", \"Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients With ILI ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Virus Detection ::: RESULTS\", \"Seasonality ::: RESULTS\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\", \"DISCUSSION\"],\n      generic: [\"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Cameroon is located in Central Africa, and it exhibits many of the major climates and ecosystems of the continent.

In the south and along the coast, temperatures vary between 22°C and 29°C.\", \"We conducted a prospective observational study from January through December 2009 in 14 ILI sentinel sites established for influenza surveillance in 2007, located in major urban centers in the following 4 regions of the country: Center (5 sites), Littoral (3 sites), North (2 sites), and West (4 sites) (Figure 1). The sentinel sites were private (7 sites) and public (7 sites) primary healthcare centers. At each sentinel site, trained nurses or physicians identified all ILI cases presenting at the clinics from Monday through Sunday. The surveillance staff consisted of facility staff who worked on the surveillance program on a voluntary basis. An ILI case was defined as an outpatient presenting with sudden onset of fever (temperature >38°C) and cough or sore throat, with the onset of symptoms within the prior 5 days. All individuals with ILI were considered eligible for enrollment. Subjects were enrolled on a daily basis. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all identified cases who were ≥18 years of age. For case patients aged <18 years, proxy informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians. Patients who did not meet the case definition or did not provide verbal consent were excluded from the study.\\n\", \"A standardized questionnaire to record patients' demographic characteristics and medical history was used. The questions included information on date of enrollment and symptom onset, sex, age, clinical symptoms, and vaccination status for influenza. In very young children (<3 years of age), specific symptoms (eg, sore throat, headache, and myalgia) could not be properly ascertained.\", \"The surveillance protocol was reviewed and approved by the National Research Ethics Committee and the Ministry of Health of Cameroon.\", \"Throat and/or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from all enrolled patients and then placed in 2-mL cryovials containing virus transport medium. If throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from the same patient, both swabs were placed in the same cryovial. The specimens were kept refrigerated at 4°C at the sentinel site and then were transported twice per week to the CPC, where they were divided into 3 aliquots. One aliquot was used for molecular analysis, one was used for virus isolation, and one was stored at −80°C for further analysis. Specimens were packaged using a triple packaging system at the sentinel sites and were transported refrigerated in cool boxes.\", \"At the CPC, total RNA was extracted from 140 µL of each sample, using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (QIAgen, Courtaboeuf, France) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Purified RNA was frozen at −80°C in aliquots.\", \"We tested samples by real-time and multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using a modified version of a previously published protocol for RNA virus detection [9, 10]. The positive controls for each virus were made of RNA extracts of cell supernatants of cultivated viruses and were provided by the Virology Laboratory of the Caen University Hospital (France). Water was used as a negative control.\", \"All samples were first tested using a 1-step real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of influenza A and B viruses, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol. Subsequently, the same samples were tested using 4 multiplex RT-PCR methods, targeting 12 RNA respiratory viruses. HMPV and RSV were detected by multiplex RT-PCR method 1; PIV 1–4 by multiplex RT-PCR method 2; HRV, enterovirus, and influenza C virus by multiplex RT-PCR method 3; and HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1 by multiplex RT-PCR method 4. The products of multiplex RT-PCR methods 1–3 were subjected to heminested multiplex RT-PCR, as described previously [9]. However, multiplex method 1 was modified by using only primers for HMPV and RSV. Multiplex method 4 was developed for the simultaneous detection of the 4 HCoVs, using primers described by Vabret et al [10]. Multiplex RT-PCR and heminested PCR products were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis, using an ethidium bromide–stained 2% agarose gel.\", \"We amplified each sample in the 4 different multiplex RT-PCR assays, each containing primers for 2 or 4 different viral targets. For each viral target, limit of detection (LOD) was assessed using 10-fold dilution series of the corresponding positive control. The LOD corresponded to the highest dilution of the positive control that gave a visualized band on the electrophoretic agarose gel. A sample was considered positive for a specific virus when its electrophoretic band was the same size as that of the corresponding sample of positive-control virus. We observed amplification only in the presence of RNA derived from the specific positive control virus. No amplification occurred in the negative controls. The LODs demonstrated a similar sensitivity between the different multiplex assays.\", \"Questionnaire information and laboratory results were recorded in a central database (MS Access) situated at the CPC. We analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects and the positive cases, as well as the seasonal patterns of all respiratory viruses. The Student t test, the Mann–Whitney U test, and the Kruskal–Wallis rank test were used for continuous variables, and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of infected patients, using a stepwise logistic regression model. Statistical significance was assessed at a P value of < .05 for all parameters. Uncertainty was expressed as 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical analysis was implemented using Stata, version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\", \"From January through December 2009, we obtained 561 samples from patients presenting with ILI (Table 1) at the 14 surveillance sites: 335 (59.7%) were from the Center region, 137 (24.4%) were from the West region, 58 (10.3%) were from the Littoral region, and 31 (5.6%) were from the North region. There were 281 males (50.1%), 273 females (48.7%), and 7 (1.2%) with no sex specified. The patients' age ranged between 1.2 months and 75 years (median, 6 years). A total of 44.6% of all enrolled patients with ILI were children <5 years of age.\\n\", \"All patients presented with fever, because this was the inclusion criterion. Cough, rhinorrhea, and fatigue were present in >50% of cases (Table 1). Of the 561 samples tested, 365 (65.1%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen. Among the 365 positive samples, a single infection was detected in 312 (85.5%), while coinfections were found in 53 (14.5%). Single infections and coinfections occurred in all age groups, but the highest percentage of viral infections was observed in children <5 years old (180 of 365 [49.3%]). Of the 180 infections among children <5 years of age, 142 (78.8%) were single infections, and 38 (21.2%) were coinfections.\", \"Influenza virus and HRV were the most frequently identified viruses, with detection in 158 (28.2%) and 100 (17.8%) of patients with ILI, respectively. Of the 158 influenza viruses detected, 154 (97.5%) were influenza A virus (4 were A[H1N1], 8 were 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [A{H1N1}pdm09], and 142 were A[H3N2]), 2 were influenza B virus, and 2 were influenza C virus. The detection rate of the other viruses was 7.5% for PIV types 1–4, 5.9% for enterovirus, 5.7% for RSV, 5.3% for HCoV, and 5.0% for HMPV (Table 2).\", \"HRV was the most common virus detected in children <5 years of age (25.6%), followed by influenza A virus (18.4%), PIV (12.0%), and RSV (10.4%). In contrast, influenza A virus (35.3%) was the most common virus detected in the groups aged ≥5 years, followed by HRV (11.5%). The remaining viruses were detected in <10% of individuals in all age groups, with the exception of enterovirus, which was detected in 13.0% in the 15–24-year age group (Supplementary Table 1).\", \"The detection rate was significantly higher among children <5 years old, compared with persons ≥5 years old, for RSV (26 of 250 [10.4%] vs 5 of 296 [1.7%]; P < .001), PIV (30 of 250 [12.0%] vs 9 of 296 [3.0%]; P < .001), and HRV (64 of 250 [25.6%] vs 35 of 296 [11.8%]; P = .001). Conversely, influenza viruses were more frequently detected in persons ≥5 years old, compared with children <5 years old (105 of 250 [42.0%] vs 48 of 296 [16.2%]; P = .001).\", \"In the multivariate analysis adjusted by age, influenza viruses were more likely to be detected in patients with cough (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1–9.2), rhinorrhea (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6–6.2), and fatigue (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1–4.9), whereas RSV was more likely to be detected in patients with sore throat (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.3–31.5). No clinical symptoms were specifically associated with the other surveyed viruses.\", \"Among the positive patients with known age, the detection rate for coinfections was significantly higher (P = .001) in the group aged <5 years (38 of 250 [15.2%]) than in the group aged ≥5 years (14 of 296 [4.7%]). No significant difference (P = .345) was detected for single infections between the 2 age groups (142 of 250 [56.8%] vs 162 of 296 [54.7%]).\", \"Age-adjusted analysis of clinical symptoms in patients with coinfections versus those with single infections found no statistical differences. Of the 53 coinfections, dual infections occurred in 49 cases, triple infections in 3 cases, and quadruple infections in 1 case. The viruses most frequently observed in coinfections were HRV (28 cases), influenza A virus (19 cases), enterovirus (13 cases), and HMPV (11 cases). HRV with HCoV or PIV or influenza A virus were the most common coinfections, constituting 9 (16.9%), 9 (16.9%), and 7 (13.2%) of all 53 coinfections, respectively.\", \"We observed virus circulation throughout the study period. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the temporal patterns of virus detection. Influenza A virus was mostly detected from June through November, with 2 major peaks observed during June–July and October–November. Enterovirus was mostly detected from January through June. Higher HRV, PIV, and enterovirus activity coincided with a decrease in influenza A virus circulation. RSV was mostly detected from October through December, with a peak in October. HMPV was mostly detected in June and July. The period of higher activity of RSV and HMPV coincided with that of influenza A virus. HRV, PIV, and HCoV were detected throughout the study period, with no evident temporal patterns.\\n\", \"This report contains the first description of the etiology of respiratory viruses associated with patients with ILI in Cameroon. We detected respiratory viruses in 65.1% of our samples; influenza virus and HRV were the most common viruses detected. The high frequency of virus detection among patients with ILI in our study is consistent with that of studies conducted in other countries, including Madagascar (75.1%) [7], Senegal (58.5%) [6], Kenya (56%) [5], Shanghai (59.5%) [11], and Brazil (61.8%) [12]. In other studies in the developed and developing worlds, however, respiratory viruses were detected in <50% of cases [2, 4, 11, 13–16]. These differences could be due to true differences in overall burden, to differences in study populations, or to the use of different diagnostic techniques. Druce et al in Australia [14] included hospitalized patients in their study for 5 months over a 12-month period, and Puzelli et al in Italy [4] included hospitalized patients during the winter. Lina et al in France [2] used immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and immunostaining for the detection of respiratory viruses in their samples, and Laguna-Torres et al in Peru [13] used viral isolation. These techniques are known to be less sensitive than molecular techniques.\", \"Like in many other studies [4, 6, 7, 13–15], influenza A virus was the most common viral pathogen detected in patients with ILI. In addition, PIV, RSV, HCoV, HMPV, and enterovirus were identified from patient's specimens and contributed collectively to 29.4% of all ILI cases in our study. The rate of detection of RSV in our study (5.7%) was lower than rates reported by other investigators. For example, in a study performed in Madagascar [7, 17], 21.2% of samples from patients with ILI were positive for RSV. The low proportion of RSV-positive samples in our study could be because we did not include hospitalized children, as RSV has been shown to be a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital [2, 14]. The detection rate for HCoV (5.3%), PIVs (7.5%), and HMPV (5.0%) was in agreement with data from other studies [16, 18–21].\", \"The detection rate of influenza A virus was significantly higher among patients with ILI who were ≥5 years of age [13], while other viruses, such as HRV, PIV, and RSV, were prevalent among children aged <5 years. These findings are consistent with reports from other studies [2, 14, 18, 22–24]. A(H3N2) was predominant in 2009 in Cameroon, a finding that was similar in other Central and West Africa countries [25, 26] despite the introduction of A(H1N1)pdm09 in several countries worldwide in that year.\", \"Recent data from tropical countries, including Senegal and Cambodia, demonstrate that the seasonality of influenza virus transmission corresponds mostly with the rainy season, and only a few cases can be detected during the dry season [27, 28]. This is consistent with our finding of a higher circulation of influenza virus during June–July and October–November 2009, corresponding to the rainy season in most of the areas where our sentinel sites are located. However, the seasonality of influenza virus in Cameroon in 2009 contrasts our earlier study that showed that A(H1N1) was the prevalent influenza A virus subtype circulating in the country in 2008 and that it had no marked seasonality [8]. This highlights the need for multiple years of influenza surveillance to properly define the temporal patterns of influenza virus circulation, especially in tropical areas, where less demarcated seasonal patterns are observed.\", \"HRV was the second most frequent viral agent detected, with positive results for 17% of patients with ILI, including all age groups. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that HRV is responsible for a large proportion of acute respiratory tract infections in both adults and children, composing 10% to >40% of respiratory infections [12, 16, 29, 30]. HRV circulated year-round, a finding shown in other studies [7, 12, 15]. Increased HRV circulation coincided with a period of decreased activity for influenza virus, a situation also observed in Madagascar [7]. In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected in children <5 years of age (25.6%). This finding contrasts with other studies conducted in Senegal [6] and China [11], where the predominant virus detected in children <5 years of age was RSV. This difference could be due to different inclusion criteria for the study subjects. We included mostly children with upper respiratory tract infection; the studies conducted in Senegal and China also included children with lower respiratory tract infection. HRV has been reported to be the major cause of upper respiratory tract infections in children in Italy [29].\", \"Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, we did not test for some respiratory DNA viruses (adenovirus and bocavirus), and we did not test for any respiratory bacteria. Adenovirus has been shown to be responsible for up to 13% of acute respiratory tract infections [18, 20]. As such, our results may underestimate the overall frequency of respiratory viral infections among ILI patients in Cameroon. Second, although our findings suggest considerable circulation of respiratory viruses in the country, we are limited in our ability to fully assess the burden of these viral agents: because our focus was on patients with ILI who presented at selected outpatient clinics, we lack data on the contribution of the investigated viruses to cases of pneumonia resulting in hospitalization. Third, the involvement of facility staff on a voluntary basis, with frequent shifts in personnel to other facilities, resulted in the poor performance of sentinel sites in some regions. This, coupled with the narrow interval of our study (1 year), hindered our ability to implement region-specific analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in virus circulation in relation to climatic and geographic factors.\", \"Despite these limitations, this study is the first to describe the etiology of RNA viral pathogens involved in upper respiratory tract infections in Cameroon. These viruses may also induce more severe disease, especially in young children, which should be investigated. We have also shown that the use of multiplex RT-PCR permits a rapid differential diagnosis of ILI cases, which could potentially facilitate rapid detection of epidemics of respiratory virus infection and, therefore, rapid responses to outbreaks.\", \"This study should be expanded over several years and in different settings (eg, hospitals) to ascertain the seasonal variation of ARI and individual viruses and to provide a better understanding of the epidemiology and spectrum of illness caused by respiratory viruses in Cameroon.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23169968/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis573\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC3259199\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/j.virol.2011.12.002\",\n  title: \"Characterization and inhibition of norovirus proteases of genogroups I and II using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay\",\n  doc_date: \"2012-02-01\",\n  authors: [\"Kyeong-Ok.Chang\", \"Daisuke.Takahashi\", \"Om.Prakash\", \"Yunjeong.Kim\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"MD145pro efficiently cleaved substrates originated from the cleavage site of GI norovirus ::: Results\", \"Z factor analysis ::: Results\", \"DMSO tolerance ::: Results\", \"NVpro and MD145pro showed a similar inhibitor profile ::: Results\", \"Chemical shift mapping to study the interaction of NVpro and chymostatin ::: Results\", \"Docking model of NVpro with chymostatin ::: Results\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"The expression and purification of proteases from NV and MD145 viruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"The expression and purification of proteases from NV and MD145 viruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Substrates ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"FRET protease assays ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Correction factor for the inner filter effects ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Determination of kcat/km ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Determination of Z factor ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Determination of Z factor ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"DMSO tolerance ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\", \"Pilot screening of protease inhibitors ::: FRET protease assay with protease inhibitors ::: Materials and methods\", \"Determination of IC50 and Ki of chymostatin ::: FRET protease assay with protease inhibitors ::: Materials and methods\", \"Solution NMR spectroscopy of NVpro ::: Materials and methods\", \"Docking calculations ::: Materials and methods\", \"Statistics ::: Materials and methods\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Noroviruses are responsible for more than 60% of all food- or water-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks in humans with an estimated 23 million annual cases in the U.S. alone, followed by Salmonella infection (C.D.C., 2010, Fankhauser et al., 1998). The symptoms of noroviral gastroenteritis such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, fever, chills, myalgias and sore throat usually last for 24 to 48 h (Green et al., 2001). Although noroviruses generally cause mild to moderate gastroenteritis, it can incapacitate affected individuals in military troops on ships or in war zones (Green et al., 2001), and can be severe to life-threatening in the young, elderly and immunocompromised patients (Atmar and Estes, 2006, Dolin, 2007). Recent studies have shown that noroviral diarrhea can persist for up to 4 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002, Sakai et al., 2001) and the viruses can be excreted for up to 3 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been reported that norovirus diarrhea and shedding lasted longer than 2 years in an immunocompromised patient (Nilsson et al., 2003).\", \"The Norwalk virus (NV) is the first enteric calicivirus discovered in 1972 (Kapikian et al., 1972). Since the discovery of the first norovirus, at least five genogroups have been established in the genus Norovirus. Among them GI, GII, and rarely GIV viruses infect humans. The GI and GII noroviruses are further subdivided into genotypes GI/1–7 and GII/1–15 (Green, 2007). NV is the most studied prototype virus and is classified as GI/1 strain. In recent years, GII/4 noroviruses became predominantly associated with norovirus outbreaks and sporadic cases worldwide (Siebenga et al., 2010, Zheng et al., 2010). Overall, norovirus strains belonging to the GII are found in 75–100% of sporadic cases of norovirus infections (Patel et al., 2009), and GII/4 strains account for 60–70% of all reported norovirus outbreaks globally (Kroneman et al., 2008, Siebenga et al., 2009).\", \"However, no vaccine or antiviral drug is currently available for norovirus infections, which is largely due to the absence of cell culture systems and animal models for human noroviruses. Noroviruses show high diversity, and immunity to one strain does not necessarily provide protection from infection with another strain. In addition, inadequate long-term immunity against noroviruses is indicated by repeated infections in adults (Glass et al., 2009, Green, 2007). Although noroviruses do not multiply in food or water, they can cause large outbreaks because as few as 10–100 virions are sufficient to cause illness in a healthy adult (Green, 2007). Noroviruses are classified as NIAID category B priority pathogens (NIAID) due to their highly contagious nature and a potential to cause a serious public health challenge. Therefore, development of antiviral drugs is highly desirable for preventing and treating norovirus infections.\", \"Noroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses and encode three open reading frames (ORFs) for a nonstructural polyprotein and minor and major structural proteins. The gene organization of the norovirus nonstructural polyproteins encoded by ORF1 is N-terminal protein (Nterm, NS1-2), NTPase (NS3), p22 (3A-like protein, NS4), VPg (NS5), protease (Pro, NS6), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol, NS7) (Green et al., 2001) (Fig. 1\\n). Norovirus protease specifically recognizes and cleaves LQ/GP (Nterm/NTPase), LQ/GP (NTPase/p20), PE/GK (p20/VPg), FE/AP (VPg/Pro), and LE/GG (Pro/Pol) junctions to produce the mature proteins during viral replication (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Liu et al., 1999, Sosnovtsev et al., 2006). Norovirus protease is classified as 3C-like cysteine protease due to its similarity to picornavirus 3C protease, which has a catalytic triad of amino acids composed of C, H, and E or D (Green, 2007, Nakamura et al., 2005). Since norovirus protease is essential for viral replication, viral protease represents an attractive target for antiviral drug development. The design and screening of antiviral agents targeting viral protease can be greatly facilitated by the availability of an assay that is suitable for large scale screening of potential novel drugs targeting viral protease.\", \"The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protease assay has been developed to provide a rapid and specific identification of protease inhibitors for various cellular and viral proteases including foot-and-mouth virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Blanchard et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007). In this assay system, substrates have a fluorescence donor and a quencher on each end, and the donor fluorescence signal in the uncleaved substrate is inhibited by the interaction of the fluorescence donor and quencher. Once substrates are cleaved by a protease, the donor fluorescence is no longer quenched, yielding an increase in fluorescence intensity. Addition of protease inhibitors to the assay inhibits the cleavage of the substrates, which leads to reduced fluorescence intensity, enabling screening of potential protease inhibitors. The FRET protease assay system is also a useful tool for measuring the activity and substrate specificity of a protease. So far, most of information on the proteolytic processing of the norovirus proteases has been obtained using in vitro transcription–translation assay systems (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Scheffler et al., 2007, Seah et al., 1999, Someya and Takeda, 2009). Limited studies are reported on the kinetics of GI norovirus proteases using fluorogenic (Someya et al., 2008) or chromogenic substrates (Hussey et al., 2011). However studies on those of GII norovirus protease are not available. Furthermore, a FRET-based protease assay suitable as a high-throughput screening of protease inhibitors has not yet been reported for norovirus proteases of GI or GII noroviruses (Zeitler et al., 2006).\", \"In this study, we describe the development and application of a high-throughput FRET assay using norovirus proteases from NV (NVpro) and MD145 virus (MD145pro) that belong to genogroups I (GI/1) and II (GII/4), respectively. Based on the assay, similar kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrates and inhibition by a selection of standard protease inhibitors including chymostatin were observed for NVpro and MD145pro. The binding of chymostatin and NVpro was also studied to validate the interactions using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\", \"The NVpro and MD145pro exhibited enzymatic activity with similar cleavage efficiency on each substrate (kcat/km) (Fig. 2\\n, Table 1\\n), suggesting that MD145pro is able to efficiently recognize and cleave the substrates derived from a cleavage site of GI norovirus. Both proteases showed higher cleavage efficiency towards the truncated substrate (DFHLQGP) as indicated by higher kcat/km value, compared to the substrate of 14 residues (EPDFHLQGPEDLAK) (Table 1). The mutant NV protease (C139A) did not increase fluorescence signal on addition of substrates, as expected (data not shown). The edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl was used as a substrate for further experiments.\", \"The Z factor is a measure of the distance between the standard deviation for the positive (fluorescence signal) and negative (background) controls of the assay, and is used to evaluate the overall quality of a high-throughput screening assay (Inglese et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 1999). A Z factor of 0.5 or greater is considered robust and reliable indicator for an assay system for screening purpose (Blanchard et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 1999). Fig. 3\\nis the scatter plot of fluorescence units from positive or negative control wells, showing assay range and the data variation. The mean Z factor for our FRET protease assay using NVpro and edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl as a substrate was calculated as 0.86, demonstrating excellent signal-to-background ratio, and robustness and sensitivity of the assay.\", \"The effect of DMSO on the FRET-assay with NVpro was determined and shown in Fig. 4\\n. DMSO concentrations of 0.5–2% (final concentration, v/v) did not significantly affect enzymatic activity, indicating that this assay is tolerant of DMSO up to 2%. All the experiments in this study contained less than 1.5% DMSO.\", \"Four commercially available serine protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, TPCK, and TLCK) and a papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (antipain) were used to probe the inhibitor specificity of each protease. Chymostatin and TPCK at 50 μM markedly decreased fluorescence intensity from inhibition of substrate cleavage by NVpro and MD145pro (Fig. 5\\n). However, TLCK, antipain and leupeptin failed to show significant inhibition of NVpro or MD145pro under the same condition. Then, chymostatin was used to determine the IC50 and inhibition constants Ki against both proteases. The dose response curves for chymostatin on NVpro and MD145pro are shown in Fig. 6A. Chymostatin inhibited NVpro and MD145pro with a similar efficiency indicated by comparable IC50 and inhibition constant Ki values (Table 2\\n). These results indicate that proteases from two predominant norovirus genogroups share a similar inhibitor profile.\", \"Since chymostatin significantly inhibited norovirus proteases in the FRET assay, the binding of chymostatin and NVpro was validated using NMR spectroscopy. A series of 1H–15N HSQC spectra of NVpro with increasing concentrations of chymostatin were analyzed to identify the residues of NVpro involved in the interaction with chymostatin. NMR chemical shift perturbations of backbone amide (1H and 15N) resonance in the 1H–15N HSQC spectra are sensitive probes for changes in chemical environments surrounding amino acid residues and/or in the relative populations of different conformations in protein structural ensemble (Shuker et al., 1996). The weighted chemical shift differences of 1H–15N resonances for NVpro in the presence of varying concentrations of chymostatin were compared to those observed in the absence of chymostatin (Fig. 7A). Significant chemical shift changes were observed during chymostatin titration in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 7A and B), indicating the specific interaction between NVpro and chymostatin. On the other hand, PB compound added as an unrelated control caused no significant chemical shift perturbation for NVpro (Fig. 7C). In the presence of 2-fold molar excess of chymostatin, the residues of NVpro that showed significantly shifts (Δd ≥ 0.04) were T4*, K11*, G17, T27, V31*, I49, A52*, E54, G60, L97, R100, G102, A105*, Q110*,V114*, H115*, Q117*, G119*, A141*, R147*, G133*, G137*, D138*, C139*, G140*, A141*, R147*, V152, H157*, A159, A160*, T161*, K162*, S163*, N165*, and T166*. The residues that could not be traced out due to the peak disappearance and/or line broadening are marked with asterisks and the largest positive values (Δd ≥ 0.15) in Fig. 7A. The line-broadening effects are likely indicative of chemical exchange on the slow time scale (μs–ms) due to the conformational dynamics of NVpro interacting with chymostatin.\", \"To corroborate the result obtained for NVpro-chymostatin interaction using NMR spectroscopy, we constructed a docking model for NVpro complexed with chymostatin using HADDOCK program (de Vries et al, Dominguez et al., 2003). During the docking, experimental information on the interface between NVpro and chymostatin derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation was required as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking of two molecules. Based on the NVpro chemical shift perturbation observed in the presence of chymostatin and higher solvent accessibility, T4, K11, S14, A52, K62, R65, D90, E93, L95, R100, Q110, M120, K146, R147, T161, K162, and S163 are designated as active residues in AIRs. In addition, catalytically important residues E54, G137, and C139, which displayed significant perturbation but lower solvent accessibility were also selected as active residues. H30, S91, R112, I135, and P136 adjacent to those active residues were defined as passive residues. The positions of the active and passive residues for NVpro are indicated on the structure (Figs. 8A and B). As a result of the docking calculation, several different clusters with similar HADDOCK score were obtained. For all those clusters, it is indicated that chymostatin is positioned near the active and substrate binding sites of NVpro. The structural ensemble in the lowest energy cluster has RMSD value of 0.8 ± 0.2 Å over all backbone atoms. The representative structure of the lower energy cluster is presented in Fig. 8. The structure has favorable energy values, van der Waals energy of − 27.1 kcal mol− 1 and electrostatic energy of − 145.3 kcal mol− 1, but higher restraint violation energy of 169.9 kcal mol− 1. This higher violation is mostly due to our unbiased selection of active residues showing chemical shift perturbation. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, several residues do not have any direct interactions with chymostatin (T4, K11, K62, R65, S91, E93, L95, R100, M120, K146, and R147). It is highly probable that those residues distant from the binding site were indirectly affected and experienced a certain degree of conformational changes upon binding of chymostatin. The docking model depicted in Fig. 8 demonstrates that chymostatin bound to NVpro in a canonical substrate binding mode as also suggested by NMR data; NVpro-chymostatin interactions occur mainly in C-terminal domain and an arch formed by two β-sheets, βII and cII, covers the chymostatin.\", \"Noroviruses are the leading cause of food- or water-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, affecting millions of people in the U.S. alone. Norovirus infection causes debilitating illness in people of all age groups at military bases, as well as in cruise ships, schools, and hospitals. Noroviruses require only a few viral particles to initiate infection and are highly contagious. Moreover, long-lasting immunity following natural infection rarely develops in people. Considering these challenges, antiviral drugs for controlling norovirus infections are in urgent need. Norovirus protease is known to be responsible for critical virus-mediated post-translational cleavages of the polypeptide encoding the viral proteins. Therefore, inhibition of the viral protease has the capacity to prevent viral replication. There are several viral protease inhibitors on the market or under development for pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and SARS coronavirus (Ghosh et al., 2007, Kazmierski et al., 2006, Tsantrizos, 2008, Walker et al., 2003). Robust and reliable assays for high throughput screening of potential norovirus protease inhibitors can greatly facilitate the development of antiviral drugs against the viral protease.\", \"The genogroup I and II noroviruses are associated with majority of norovirus infections in humans. The amino acid homology of proteases among GI noroviruses is 90–94%, while the homology between GI and GII norovirus proteases is about 65–69%. However, the amino acid sequence analysis showed that the key residues of the catalytic site and residues forming the S1 subsite are conserved in GI and GII noroviruses (Ng and Parra, 2010). A co-transcription and translation assay study using MD145 ORF1 on the enzymatic activity of MD145 (GII) protease suggested that substrate specificity requirements are similar to those for NV (GI) based on western blots and radioactive microsequencing mapping (Belliot et al., 2003). However, there is little information on the comparative kinetic properties of proteases from GI and GII noroviruses. Therefore, we developed a FRET protease assay with high-throughput capability to use for screening of norovirus protease inhibitors, and study the substrate and inhibitor specificities of norovirus proteases of GI and GII noroviruses.\", \"The conserved amino acid sequences of P7-P6′ at the N2/3 cleavage site of NV and MD145 noroviruses differ in P3 (H/E), P4 (F/Y) and P6 (P/G) residues, of which P4 position is reported to be important for maximal activity by earlier mapping studies of the cleavage sites recognized by calicivirus proteases (Hardy et al., 2002). In our study, MD145pro cleaved the substrates spanning P7–P7′ or P5–P2′ residues from the NS2/3 cleavage site of NV with an efficiency similar to NVpro, indicating that MD145pro recognized and cleaved the substrates with H and F in P3 and P4 positions, respectively, as efficiently as NVpro. In addition, NVpro and MD145pro cleaved the substrate with P5–P2′ residues more efficiently than substrate with P7–P7′ residues, suggesting that P3′–P7′ and P6–P7 residues are not necessary for substrate binding and cleavage by both proteases. These results are in line with an earlier report that p-nitroaniline peptide with P5–P1 residues was most efficiently cleaved by GI protease (Southampton strain) compared to those containing P6–P1 or P4–P1 residues, and the substrate of P3–P1 residues was not cleaved (Hussey et al., 2011). In addition, Chiba virus protease (GI)-substrate complex modeling based on crystal structure suggested that the substrate binding is stabilized by interactions of substrate residues P5–P2 to the corresponding binding sites of the protease (Nakamura et al., 2005).\", \"We then evaluated the inhibitor specificities of NVpro and MD145pro using a set of commercially available standard protease inhibitors. Norovirus protease is structurally similar to the chymotrypsin superfamily based on X-ray crystallography (Nakamura et al., 2005, Zeitler et al., 2006). The standard protease inhibitors share a common mechanism of action, although they do not share the primary sequence for the three-dimensional structures (Bode and Huber, 1992, Laskowski and Kato, 1980). The screening of protease inhibitors in our assay revealed that the activities of both proteases were significantly inhibited by the presence of chymostatin and TPCK. Detailed kinetic studies of the inhibition of NVpro and MD145pro by chymostatin confirmed that both proteases have similar inhibition profiles, suggesting that protease inhibitors may be developed against multiple norovirus genogroups. In addition, the versatility of the assay allows incorporation of proteases from different genogroups so that screening of compounds against various norovirus genogroups can be performed. The quality and suitability of the FRET assay for high throughput screening were demonstrated by high Z factor of 0.86.\", \"The interaction of chymostatin and NVpro was validated by the NMR studies. The analysis of NMR chemical shift mapping data revealed that the resonances of residues that are involved in substrate binding sites or active sites are greatly affected. Chymostatin that exhibited strong inhibitory effects against both proteases contains G–L–F moiety. Previous structural studies on the interaction of chymotrypsin and serine standard protease inhibitors showed that side chain of the P1 residue (F) of chymostatin fits into the specificity subsite of chymotrypsin, and the carbonyl oxygen extends toward the oxyanion hole formed by the G and S residues located in the active site of the enzyme. The P1–P3 residues of chymostatin also interact with the enzyme by forming a short, anti-parallel β-sheet interaction (Coombs et al., 1999). These interactions represent a substrate-like binding mode for enzymes. Our docking results using HADDOCK based on NMR chemical shift perturbation study indicate that chymostatin specifically interacts with NVpro in a canonical binding mode that can be seen in the protease-substrate/substrate-directed inhibitor complexes. At this stage we are not able to give a clear answer for whether chymostatin covalently modifies the nucleophilic thiol group and forms hemithioacetal adduct or forms non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. However our results indicate that critical residues for the catalysis are targeted by chymostatin.\", \"In conclusion, we demonstrate a development and application of a FRET norovirus protease (GI and GII) assay with high-throughput capability for screening potential antiviral compounds and monitoring enzymatic reactions, and the interaction of chymostatin and norovirus protease by NMR spectroscopy. These results provide valuable information for the study of antivirals and enzyme activities.\", \"Full-lengths codon-optimized cDNAs corresponding to the complete amino acid sequence of NVpro and MD145pro were synthesized and cloned into the pET28a vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). The synthesized cDNA sequences include start and stop codons as well as sequences encoding N-terminal six H for Ni column purification. The plasmid encoding NVpro or MD145pro was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Each protein was expressed in a regular Luria-Bertani broth by induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37 C° in a shaking incubator. The harvested cells were sonicated and ultracentifuged. Both proteases were soluble and the supernatants were applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) for purification. The mutant NVpro with C (nucleophile) to A substitution at position 139 (C139A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All proteins were monomers with a size of approximately 20 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 9\\n), which is in contrast to previous reports that norovirus proteases stably formed a dimer (NVpro) or were predominantly dimeric in solution (Southampton virus protease) (Hussey et al., 2011, Zeitler et al., 2006). Interestingly, our preliminary x-ray crystallography revealed NVpro as dimers, suggesting that the His-tag at the N-terminus does not interfere with dimerization (data not shown). These results indicate that the concentration and/or condition of the prepared protease may influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium of NVpro.\", \"For NMR studies, uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro was expressed in the E. coli BL21 cells grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 g/L 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and purified as previously described (Takahashi et al., 2011). Briefly, the cells containing the expression plasmid encoding NVpro were grown in a starter culture consisting of 50 ml Luria Bertani media at 37 °C for 6–8 h. The cells were then grown in M9 minimal media to an OD600 value of 1.0 and induced with 1.0 mM IPTG for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, subsequently resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM imidazole, and sonicated at 4 °C. After centrifugation of the cell lysates, NVpro was purified from the cell lysate supernatant using a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 prep grade (GE healthcare, Amersham, UK) was applied as a final purification step. Gel-filtration standard (Biorad, Hercules, CA) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) was used to analyze the molecular weight of the eluted proteins. NMR samples contained uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro (0.1–0.6 mM), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 3 mM NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O unless otherwise noted.\", \"Two fluorogenic substrates, edans-EPDFHLQGPEDLAK-dabcyl (Zeitler et al., 2006) and edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl derived from the P7–P7′ and P5-P2′ residues on the NS2/3 cleavage site in ORF1 of NV, respectively, were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). The designation of substrate residues for P1 and P1′ starts at the scissile bond and counts toward the N- or C-terminus, respectively, as suggested by Schechter and Berger (1967).\", \"Stock solutions (10 mM) of the substrates were prepared in DMSO, and diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES buffer [pH 8.0] containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 60% Glycerol, and 6 mM DTT). The 25 μl of protease (0.5 μM, final concentration) was mixed with 25 μl of serially diluted substrates in assay buffer in a 96-well black plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). The fluorescence signals were detected using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800, Biotek, Winooski, VT) every 5 min for 30 min at 37 °C.\", \"The background (substrate control well without protease)-subtracted relative fluorescence units (RFU) were corrected for inner filter effects. The inner filter effects are produced at higher substrate concentrations due to the absorption of fluorescence by the quencher on the adjacent substrates, and cause attenuation of fluorescence intensity, abolishing the linear correlation between the cleaved substrate concentration and the fluorescence intensity (Cuerrier et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007). Briefly, serially diluted edans reference standards (free edans) were added to wells in a 96-well plate with or without equal concentration of substrate, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader. The correction factors to compensate for the inner filter effects were determined empirically as described previously (Cuerrier et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007).\", \"The corrected RFU was converted to the concentration of the product of protease reaction by plotting edans fluorescence reference standard as RFU versus concentration. The initial velocities (Vo), rate of enzyme reaction, were calculated using the first 30 min of the progress curve, and plotted against substrate concentrations (Michaelis–Menten plot) using GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine the ratio of kcat/km, which is the measure of efficiency of the catalytic reaction (specificity constant).\", \"The substrate edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl (16 μM, final concentration) was added to wells containing NVpro at 0.5 μM of final concentration (positive control wells) or assay buffer (negative control wells) in a 96-well black plate. Since Z factor is dependent on means and standard deviations, each combination had more than 30 wells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for up to 1 h and the fluorescence readings were obtained. The means and standard deviations of fluorescence were calculated for negative and positive wells to determine Z factor as previously described (Blanchard et al., 2004, Inglese et al., 2007).Zfactor=1−3σρ+σnμp−μn.\\n\", \"Where, σp\\n = standard deviation of positive controls, σn\\n = standard deviation of negative controls, μp\\n = means of positive controls, μn\\n = means of negative controls.\", \"To investigate the tolerance of the assay toward DMSO, a solvent typically used to dissolve test compounds, 50 μl reactions containing 0.5 μM NVpro and 16 μM fluorogenic substrate (edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl) in assay buffer were supplemented with DMSO. The DMSO concentrations varied between 0% and 6% (v/v) at otherwise constant conditions. Fluorescence was measured following incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate to determine the effect of DMSO on enzyme activity.\", \"Commercially available standard protease inhibitors including serine protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone [TPCK], and tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone [TLCK]) and a papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (antipain) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Stock solutions (10 mM) of inhibitors were prepared in DMSO, and further diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations of DMSO in the assay did not exceed 1.5% (vol/vol). NVpro and MD145pro at a final concentration of 0.5 μM and the substrate (edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl) at 16 μM that give a strong signal and minimal inner filter effects were used for the studies. Inhibitors at a final concentration of 50 μM were pre-incubated with NVpro or MD145pro in 25 μl for 30 min at 37 °C, and the same volume of substrate was added to a 96-well black plate, followed by incubation. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader after 60 min of incubation. The substrate concentration used for pilot screening was well below the km, but substrate depletion was not observed in the control well (without an inhibitor) during 60 min incubation time. The reduction of cleaved products by each preparation was calculated by the comparison to that of control without any inhibitor.\", \"Continuous monitoring of activity kinetics of NVpro and MD145pro was performed to evaluate the detailed efficacy of chymostatin. Proteases (0.5 μM, final concentration) were mixed with serially diluted chymostatin (0–50 μM) in 25 μl of assay buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of various concentrations of substrates (30–100 μM). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader at every 5 min for up to 30 min. The RFUs were corrected for inner filter effects and converted to the concentration of the product of protease reaction. The dissociation constant for inhibitor binding (Ki) values was determined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. The dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with variable slope (four parameters) using GraphPad Prism software in order to determine the concentration of chymostatin that reduces enzyme velocity by half (IC50). The IC50 values were determined in the presence of substrate at 30 μM at 60 min.\", \"All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Varian VNMR 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance inverse detection cryogenic NMR probe. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), and analyzed with Sparky (Goddard and Kneller, 2006) and CARA software (http://www.nmr.ch) (Keller, 2004). Inhibitor titration experiments were carried out by direct addition of 10 mM stock solution of chymostatin dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) into uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro solution. 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of NVpro were monitored during addition of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 M equivalents of chymostatin. Complex points 1024 × 128 and spectral widths of 14 × 38 ppm were used to record all the spectra. Recently we have reported a total of 94% of the backbone 1H and 15N resonance assignments of free NVpro (Takahashi et al., 2011). The assignment of the HSQC spectra in the presence of chymostatin was used to investigate the interaction with the inhibitor by following the peak shifts during titration. Since the use of DMSO-d6 as a co-solvent caused a slight but traceable resonance peak shifts in dose-dependent manner, the titrations were repeated with DMSO-d6 alone. Each spectrum with varying amount of chymostatin was compared with that of DMSO-d6 at a corresponding titration point. As a control, similar experiments were repeated using an unrelated compound dissolved in DMSO-d6 that does not inhibit NVpro activity (PB compound). Chemical shift changes were characterized using a weighted chemical shift difference (Δδ − [1/2{δH\\n2\\n + 1/25δN\\n2}]1/2) (Grzesiek et al., 1996).\", \"The docking models of NVpro in complex with chymostatin were built using the HADDOCK (high-ambiguity driven biomolecular docking) program (de Vries et al, Dominguez et al., 2003), in which the experimental information on residues involved in intermolecular interaction can be used as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking. Protein residues directly involved in intermolecular interaction are defined as “active residues”, while neighboring residues of active residues as “passive residues”. HADDOCK docking protocols consist of three-stage procedure, a rigid-body energy minimization, a semi-flexible refinement in torsion angle space and a final refinement in explicit solvent. Crystal structure of NVpro (PDB code: 2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) was used as the starting structure. NVpro residues showing peak disappearance or chemical shift perturbation greater than the average shift value, 0.019 ppm, in 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of NVpro with chymostatin and possessing higher solvent accessibility were selected as active residues. Solvent accessibility was calculated using GETAREA (Robert Fraczkiewicz, 1998), where residues are defined as solvent exposed when the ratio of side-chain surface area to its random coil value exceeds 50%. All solvent accessible surface neighbors of active residues were then defined as passive residues in the docking calculation. Whole residues of the small ligand, chymostatin, were selected as active residues. Initially, a total of 1000 structures were calculated at the rigid body minimization stage. From this calculation, the 200 lowest-energy structures were then selected for the subsequent semi-flexible simulated annealing and the refinement in explicit solvent. The final structures were clustered using the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with a cutoff of 7.5 Å. All the structures were drawn with the PyMol (DeLano).\", \"The student t-test was used to compare the significance of the unpaired sample means.

With the population in Europe aged 85 years and above projected to rise from 14 million currently to 19 million by 2020 and to 40 million by 2050, and the expectation that more than 30% of European citizens will be aged over 60 years by 2050, the proportion of the population in countries at all levels of development which requires long‐term care is only set to increase dramatically over the coming decades.2\\n\", \"Outbreaks of seasonal influenza in LTCFs are well recognised, as are the challenges of preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks in these settings. The development of universally applicable guidance on the prevention and control of influenza and other respiratory viruses in LTCFs is difficult due to the huge variation in the size of facilities, patient characteristics, the intensity of care provided and resources available. Although some countries have produced guidance on IPC for use specifically in LTCFs,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 most have not. To help fill this gap, the WHO has recently published a best practice guidance document to support managers of LTCFs in the 53 WHO European Region Member States and which can be tailored according to national and local circumstances12 ( http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/330225/LTCF-best-practice-guidance.pdf?ua=1).\", \"In this review, we examine the impact of seasonal influenza in LTCFs, and approaches to the prevention and control of outbreaks, as outlined by the advice and evidence we provided in the WHO best practice document.\", \"Persons residing in LTCFs present a population very susceptible to the acquisition and spread of infectious diseases and for whom the consequences of infection may be serious. Nursing home residents are at greatest risk due to their overall frailty, close quarter living arrangements, shared caregivers, and opportunities for introduction of healthcare‐associated infections and the spread of pathogens to other facilities through resident transfers and the movement of staff and visitors in and out of the home.13, 14\\n\", \"Outbreaks of influenza caused by both influenza A and B viruses are well documented in LTCFs, and may be explosive,15 with high mortality, highlighting the need for early recognition and prompt initiation of control measures. Accurate measurement of the burden of influenza is heavily influenced by circulating types and subtypes of virus and may vary between communities and between institutions so studies that attempt to estimate this burden require temporal, geographical and institutional breadth.16 Older studies, relying on culture‐based detection techniques, may have underestimated total burden. A review of 206 published infectious outbreaks in elderly care facilities across 19 countries over 40 years identified 37 different pathogens, but influenza viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks (23%).17 In the 49 outbreaks caused by influenza, the median attack rate in residents was 33% (range 4‐94%), and 23% (range 3‐58%) among staff, with a median case‐fatality rate for residents of 6.5% (range 0‐55%). Over three consecutive 9‐year time periods between 1980 and 2008, there was no observed decrease in attack rates or case‐fatality rates; nevertheless, these data should be interpreted cautiously as antiviral use and the stringency of application of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices has changed over time.\", \"Exposure to influenza in residents of LTCFs for the elderly increases their risk of respiratory‐origin hospitalisation (relative risk [RR] 1.43 [95% CI 0.99‐2.08]), and particularly increases the risk of death due to a respiratory cause (RR 2.77 [95% CI 1.55 to 4.91]) compared to unexposed residents, despite high levels of vaccination among the residents (93%).18\\n\", \"Bronchitis and pneumonia, either primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, are the most common respiratory complications of influenza infection, but infection may also cause extrapulmonary cardiovascular, neurological and musculoskeletal manifestations. In a retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents in 381 nursing homes across three seasons, estimated for the 63% of residents with comorbid conditions, influenza contributed to approximately 28 hospitalisations, 147 courses of antibiotics and 15 deaths per 1000 person‐years annually; a higher burden than residents without comorbid conditions but in whom there were still seven hospitalisations, 99 excess antibiotic prescriptions and six deaths per 1000 residents annually.16 Increased age itself is a recognised risk factor for serious influenza infection. A systematic review evaluating populations at risk of severe influenza‐related illness found that for seasonal influenza (H3N2 or type B), there was raised risk of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR] 4.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74 to 12.41) and risk of death (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.70) among elderly people (>65 years) compared with non‐elderly people.19 Modelling studies suggest that the burden on the health services is particularly onerous for those aged 75 and above, with an estimated 36% of all influenza‐attributable respiratory hospitalisations and 74% of all influenza‐associated deaths occurring in this age group in the UK over 13 seasons,20 and accounting for 52% of total hospital bed occupancy and 69% of excess bed days occupancy in England over a similar number of seasons.21\\nKey Points 1\\nLTCFs are susceptible to seasonal influenza outbreaks, which may be explosive and with high attack rates in residents.Written IPC policies, vaccination policies for residents and staff, provision of ongoing staff IPC training and the facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices should be in place throughout the year.Although influenza vaccine efficacy is lower in the elderly and in the presence of comorbidities compared to healthy younger adults, vaccination of LTCF residents remains a major public health tool and is recommended.Vaccination of LTCF staff is recommended and should be encouraged. Although evidence for a protective effect of HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly is weak, HCW vaccination can help to protect themselves, maintain the workforce during an outbreak and act as a barrier to transmission of infection to the vulnerable.\\n\\n\", \"Outbreaks of influenza (and other respiratory virus pathogens) in LTCFs in the Northern Hemisphere occur most commonly during the winter but may occur at any time of year, particularly in the autumn months, usually due to circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and before seasonal vaccination campaigns have been fully implemented or when matching is poor; also in the spring when influenza B often peaks22 and when antibody titres may have declined in the vaccinated.23, 24\\n\", \"Influenza virus replicates in the epithelium of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with infected hosts releasing virus into the environment during breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing, producing a spray of virus‐containing particles ranging in size from 0.01 to 500 μm.25 Transmission of influenza may occur by three routes: droplet (larger‐sized particles too large to be inhaled into the lungs and which settle quickly to the ground or other surface within 2 m of the source); aerosol or droplet nuclei (small particles <5 μm which can remain suspended in the air much longer and are potentially inhalable into the lower respiratory tract); and contact (transfer of infectious particles to the mucous membranes directly or indirectly through contaminated objects). The relative importance of each of these routes in influenza transmission is unclear, and the contribution of aerosolised infectious droplet nuclei has been particularly contentious.26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 However, most influenza transmission is short‐range, and when it has occurred over longer distances, contact transmission has generally not been ruled out.32 Transmission studies often do not control for confounders such as vaccination status, handwashing practice, supershedders, amount of coughing, ward layout, surface contamination and ventilation,33 and further studies which control for these are required in this area.\", \"The incubation period of influenza is typically short, usually reported as ranging from 1 to 4 days,34 with a serial interval (time between symptom onset in a secondary case and that of its primary case) of 2.2 to 3.5 days for influenza A and 3.4 to 4.9 days for influenza B.35 The relatively short incubation period and serial interval enables the virus to spread rapidly through communities, so mitigation measures such as isolation and transmission‐based precautions should be instigated as soon as a case of suspected influenza is identified to minimise the risk of transmission to contacts.\", \"Viral shedding has generally been considered to be a proxy for influenza infectiousness,36, 37, 38 peaking 1 to 3 days after symptom onset with most healthy volunteers clearing virus by day 6 to day 7.34 However, a recent study of household influenza transmission found at most only a weak association between viral load in nose and throat swabs and infectivity, possibly due to the weak correlation between virus concentration in exhaled breath and nose and throat samples, or due to the intensity of household transmission so that even those with low viral loads are still capable of infecting those around them.39 Pre‐symptomatic shedding may occur in up to one‐third of cases,40, 41, 42, 43 and prolonged viral shedding has been reported in children,42, 44, 45 in patients hospitalised with severe influenza46 and in immunocompromised patients,47 in whom prolonged shedding may last weeks or even months.48, 49 The transmission dynamics of influenza infections in residents of LTCFs have not been studied; age >65 years and the presence of major comorbidities were associated with prolonged shedding of virus and higher viral load in a prospective observational study of hospitalised influenza patients46; these findings may raise the possibility of prolonged shedding in LTCF residents.\", \"Transmission of influenza from healthcare workers (HCWs) to hospital patients, including those in geriatric facilities, has been well documented using epidemiological linkage, nucleotide sequence analysis and contact tracking data50, 51, 52, 53 and case reports of outbreaks of influenza‐like illness in care facilities indicate that staff can transmit the virus to residents.54, 55 A systematic review comparing the incidence of influenza in HCWs with other workers not working in a healthcare setting and taking vaccination status into account, found estimated incidence rates (IRs) for all influenza infections (defined as a ≥4‐fold increase in antibody titre over the influenza season and including asymptomatic infections) of 18.7/100 population/season (95% CI 15.8 to 22.1) for unvaccinated HCWs and 6.5/100 population/season (95% CI 4.6 to 9.0) for vaccinated HCWs, both higher than the IRs in unvaccinated and vaccinated other workers (5.4/100 population/season [95% CI 3.0 to 9.8] and 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.7] respectively).56 However, no difference was observed between IRs for symptomatic infection confirmed serologically in HCWs compared to other workers; this overall lack of consistency in findings between overall and symptomatic infections indicates the need for cautious interpretation. The observed variability might be explained by HCWs being at higher risk of asymptomatic or subclinical infection, indicating that HCWs may act as an infective pool to transmit influenza to frail elderly people. Furthermore, a study of HCWs in an acute hospital during a mild epidemic season, found that 23% had serological evidence of new influenza infection during the season, implying a potential transmission risk to patients as between 28% and 59% of infected workers had subclinical infections and continued to work.57 Although the role of asymptomatic people and those with only mild symptoms in spreading influenza is uncertain, HCWs often continue to work despite having symptoms and may act as a source of infection to those in their care.58, 59, 60 Nursing home aides in particular have been shown in one Swedish study to be the occupational group at significantly greatest risk of continuing to work despite the feeling that, in the light of their perceived state of health, they should have taken sick leave.61 However, in reality the employment status of many LTCF staff is often precarious and taking unpaid sick leave may result in adverse economic consequences.\", \"LTCFs have a broad staff base and may include people with little or no formal healthcare training. Depending upon the type of facility and the nursing needs of the residents, services are provided by a range of staff including care assistants with few formal healthcare qualifications, registered nurses, domestic staff, catering and administrative staff, with additional ambulatory health services usually provided by external contractors such as general practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals not directly affiliated to the facility. Managers of LTCFs have an important role in ensuring that all staff have ongoing training on the importance and practice of IPC, and that the facilities are available for IPC measures to be implemented to a satisfactory level and with standard precautions being used at all times, regardless of the detection of a suspected outbreak. Written policies should be in place in every LTCF outlining: resident and staff influenza immunisation policy; a written outbreak management plan which includes outbreak recognition (definitions, thresholds for suspicion of an outbreak), identification of communication channels, operational measures including active surveillance, staff contingency plans, visitor restriction policies, and consideration of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis strategy; a policy for ill staff to remain off work; a policy for dealing with visitors with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection.\", \"During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, compliance with IPC measures was found to be associated with HCWs’ perception that the facilities in which they worked had clear IPC policies and protocols, and that the management had a positive attitude towards occupational health and safety and provided training in IPC practices.62 Managers in LTCFs therefore have a pivotal role in creating a strong institutional climate in which staff feel valued, with continuous accessibility to the training resources, clear IPC policies and supplies and facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices.\", \"A WHO strategy and action plan for healthy ageing in Europe 2012‐2020 recognised the benefit of proper vaccination strategies against infectious diseases, including influenza, both in older people and for health and social care workers in contact with them, and proposed priority interventions including national immunisation schedules and the implementation of infectious disease control programmes in institutions.63 Furthermore, a WHO position paper published in 2012 recommended that elderly persons ≥65 years and people with specific chronic diseases should be considered for influenza vaccination.64 Vaccination coverage of the elderly varies considerably between European countries with recent uptake rates reported between 1% and 77.4% and with only two countries (the Netherlands and the UK) achieving, or almost achieving, the WHO target of 75% coverage in the elderly.65 For residents of LTCFs, recent data available from only three countries indicated vaccination coverage rates of 71% to 89%.65\\n\", \"Vaccination of residents remains an important public health tool to protect the elderly and those with underlying conditions, but there is uncertainty about how effective immunisation is at an individual level in LTCF residents. A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in people 65 years or over, with separate analyses for those living in nursing homes and community dwelling older people,66 concluded that for elderly people living in closed communities vaccination may be slightly to moderately more effective than no vaccination at preventing influenza‐like illness (ILI) (24% [95% CI 12‐34%]), pneumonia (47% [95% CI 34‐57%]), hospitalisation (49% [19‐68%]), overall mortality (60% [95% CI 23‐79%]) and mortality from influenza or pneumonia (54% [95% CI 37‐67%]), although no significant protective effect against proven influenza was found. A later systematic review67 also found that vaccination may have a small significant protective effect against pneumonia (37% [95% CI 18‐53%]) and mortality from influenza and pneumonia (34% [95% CI 10‐53%]), in institutionalised older adults ≥60 years; also a trend towards protection against ILI (21% [95% CI −3 to 39%]). The authors did not address the effectiveness of vaccination against all‐cause mortality and, due to an insufficient number of studies, were unable to perform meta‐analyses for laboratory‐confirmed influenza or hospitalisation. The quality of the evidence is very weak in both reviews and does not definitively answer the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older people living in LTCFs. In particular, selection bias may occur by targeting the frail for immunisation; conversely people who are particularly frail or close to death may not receive vaccine resulting in overestimation of the effectiveness of vaccine on mortality (healthy recipient effect).68, 69 Although there is some indirect evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalisation, pneumonia and death from studies which have controlled for multiple confounders and compared summer and winter mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated elderly people,70, 71 accurate proof of IVE requires adequately powered studies using laboratory‐confirmed outcomes, in which confounders are controlled for and which comprehensively monitor morbidity and mortality.72\\n\", \"Infection in HCWs affects not only themselves and their immediate family but may further inhibit efforts to control an outbreak if staff shortages result in remaining staff having to care for both affected and unaffected residents.73 On this basis HCWs are recognised as a priority group for vaccination and are generally recommended to receive it.64, 74\\n\", \"High rates of staff vaccination in LTCFs have been demonstrated in several studies to decrease the risk of all‐cause mortality and ILI in frail elderly residents, with lowest rates when both HCWs and patients had high vaccine coverage rates.75, 76, 77, 78, 79 This has been somewhat refuted by a systematic review of four cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one cohort study which suggested that offering vaccination to HCW caring for people aged over 60 in LTCFs may have little or no effect on laboratory‐confirmed influenza (LCI) (Risk difference (RD) 0 (95% CI −0.03 to 0.03) and respiratory‐related hospitalisation in residents (RD 0 (95% CI −0.02 to 0.02), although there may be a small decrease in lower respiratory infections from 6% to 4% in homes where HCW vaccination is offered (RD −0.02 [95% CI −0.04 to 0.01]).80 The effects on deaths due to LRTI and all‐cause mortality were not evaluated by meta‐analysis, but reductions in all‐cause mortality were noted in the individual studies (ORs ranging from 0.56 [95% CI 0.4‐0.8] to 0.80 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.97]).75, 76, 77, 79 The authors called for high quality RCTs to address methodological flaws they identified in the included studies, and to test the effectiveness of co‐interventions such as handwashing and face‐mask use in combination with HCW vaccination. Another systematic review81 found a significant reduction in ILI and all‐cause mortality in residents associated with vaccination of HCWs (42% and 29% reductions respectively), but no significant reductions for laboratory‐confirmed influenza or all‐cause hospitalisations. Overall the authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the different outcomes, and concluded that HCW influenza vaccination can enhance patient safety. Protective effects of HCW vaccination against non‐specific outcomes may be an indication of unaccounted cluster biases, such as differences in handwashing or other IPC precautions and warrants further investigation.82 Evidence from observational and modelling studies suggests a likely proportionate effect of HCW vaccination coverage on patient protection, although no clear threshold for HCW vaccine uptake above which the protective effect on residents increases substantially has been established.83, 84, 85, 86, 87\\n\", \"Inactivated trivalent vaccines have been found to have a protective effect against proven influenza in healthy adults (overall protective effect in vaccine‐matched and poorly matched seasons 62% [95% CI 56‐67%]).88 A systematic review specifically addressing the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in HCWs found just one study reporting laboratory‐confirmed influenza in this group with a reported IVE of 88% (95% CI 59% to 96%, P=.0005).89\\n\", \"Although the currently available evidence may be weak for HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly, there is also generally no evidence against it. Therefore, it remains a biologically plausible intervention to provide individual protection to the HCW, act as a barrier against spread of infection and to help reduce the risk associated with influenza infection and prevent staff absenteeism. However, poor vaccine uptake by HCWs has been well documented. In Europe, coverage of HCWs (including those working in LTCFs) varies between countries and is generally much lower than for other vaccination targeted groups, ranging from 9.5% to 75% with a median vaccination coverage rate of 28.6%.65 In the United States, vaccination rates of 50‐70% have been reported for LTCF workers,78, 90, 91 with coverage consistently lower than among staff working in hospital settings.91 Reasons given for declining vaccination include fear of side effects, lack of concern or perception of risk, doubts about vaccine efficacy, lack of availability or inconvenient delivery of vaccine, avoidance of medications and dislike of injections.92 Although mandatory vaccination is effective if it can be implemented,93 it is not legally enforceable in all countries and settings, and infection rates after the implementation of mandatory vaccination have not been studied. The United States Department of Health and Human Services advocates a 90% HCW vaccination rate by 2020 but as yet there have been no RCTs of transmission with very high HCW vaccination rates.33 Data suggest that other interventions such as easier access to vaccine, educational activities, reminders and organisational changes can increase uptake in proportion to the number of interventional components, although most studies have only evaluated their effect on a short‐term basis whereas long‐term intervention programmes will be necessary to demonstrate a sustainable effect on uptake.94 To address low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in priority target groups, a project called TIP FLU was initiated in 2013 by the WHO Influenza and other Respiratory Pathogens programme. Adapted from the Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) approach, it is based on social and behavioural change models and provides tools to identify priority populations, determine barriers and enablers to vaccination, and to implement evidence‐based interventions. A guide and case study of the application of TIP FLU in Montenegro have been published to assist policymakers and programme managers to increase vaccine uptake among HCWs.95, 96\\n\", \"Early recognition of influenza in residents of LTCFs may be problematic due to non‐specific symptoms and the possibility of atypical presentation and lack of fever in the elderly with influenza.97, 98 Influenza may present as sudden, unexplained deterioration in physical or mental ability or exacerbation of an underlying condition with no other known cause.15 The use of surveillance case definitions for ILI in these populations may therefore miss cases, especially if they present without fever. Furthermore, other underlying conditions may impair residents’ abilities to verbalise their symptoms. This may impede the early implementation of control and treatment strategies.99 The precise definition of ILI may vary from country to country; the WHO global surveillance case definition of ILI is an acute respiratory infection with measured fever ≥38°C and cough and onset within the last 10 days,100 whereas that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) definition is sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of four systematic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath).3, 101\\n\", \"To confirm an outbreak, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or viral culture are the preferred methods of laboratory testing. Rapid point‐of‐care diagnostic tests can produce a result within 30 minutes but have lower sensitivity (median 70‐75%)102 and there may be variability between different age groups and influenza subtypes,103 although they may still be useful in outbreak situations, for example for rapid identification of influenza infection where timely access to more sensitive laboratory testing is unavailable or delayed. However, clinical judgement is required to interpret negative rapid test results for individual patients during an outbreak and negative rapid test results may not justify delaying the instigation of outbreak control measures if there is clinical and epidemiological suspicion.\", \"Early recognition of an influenza outbreak in a LTCF can facilitate timely antiviral treatment and prophylaxis to end the outbreak and thus avoid influenza‐related complications in exposed residents. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently authorised for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in Europe and the United States. However, their effectiveness has been subject to much debate113 and many clinicians have felt confused about when to use them appropriately.\", \"A modest but significant reduction in time to first alleviation of symptoms has been consistently shown in meta‐analyses of RCTs of previously healthy people, representing a 10 to 15% reduction in overall duration of symptoms in those treated with an NAI compared with those receiving placebo,114, 115, 116 with similar reductions noted from analysis of observational studies.117 This effect appears to be somewhat attenuated in the elderly.115, 118 In general there is a lack of credible evidence from RCTs that NAIs reduce the risk of hospitalisation and pneumonia,114, 115, 118 although a significant reduction was seen in hospitalisation in the influenza‐confirmed intention‐to‐treat population in one analysis (RR 0.37 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.81]),115 and reduced rates of lower respiratory tract complications were seen in two meta‐analyses (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.75]115 and 0.55 [95% CI 0.33 to 0.90]).114 However, RCTs are generally underpowered to evaluate the effects of treatment on complications due to the rarity of such events, and lack of precise outcome definition in many trials makes comparison of findings difficult. Meta‐analysis of observational studies indicated a potential effect of oseltamivir in reducing hospitalisation in the general population (all ages) compared with no antiviral (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.89]), but no significant effect was found for inhaled zanamivir (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.37 to 1.18]).117 Individual patient data meta‐analysis from 29 234 people of all ages hospitalised with 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza showed that deaths were reduced when treated with NAIs within 48 hours of onset (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.93]), supporting the use of early NAI treatment in those who require hospitalisation.119 A reduction in mortality risk for patients receiving oseltamivir compared to those not given antivirals was also noted in a meta‐analysis of three observational studies (OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.43]) but the quality of evidence was low, and related only to oseltamivir.117\\n\", \"Uncertainties remain about the effectiveness of treatment in high‐risk populations such as LTCF residents as much of the available evidence relates to previously healthy younger adults. However, given the high risk of severe complications and deaths among the elderly from influenza virus infection, where influenza antivirals are available, treatment of symptomatic LTCF residents is generally recommended to be started immediately.3, 120\\n\", \"Prophylaxis with antivirals is intended to prevent transmission of influenza virus to people who are not exhibiting ILI but who have or may have been exposed. There is a paucity of evidence from recent studies to inform a single approach for antiviral prophylaxis use in LTCFs, so decisions should be based on clinical judgement and outbreak severity.121 Prophylaxis with oseltamivir or zanamivir was shown to be more effective than placebo at preventing symptomatic influenza in individuals in the community (oseltamivir RR 0.45 [95% CI 0.30 to 0.67]; zanamivir RR 0.39 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.70]) and in household contacts (oseltamivir RR 0.20 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.44]; zanamivir RR 0.33 [95% CI 0.18 to 0.58]) in a recent meta‐analysis of RCTs.114 A reduced risk of LCI with oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis was found in a further systematic review which also included data from observational studies, for both individuals (oseltamivir OR 0.11 [95% CI 0.06 to 0.20]; zanamivir OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.35]) and households (oseltamivir OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.59]; zanamivir OR 0.18 [95% CI 0.10 to 0.31]).122 However, direct evidence of effectiveness in reducing symptomatic influenza in the frail elderly living in institutions is sparse; a non‐significant protective trend with post‐exposure zanamivir prophylaxis has been shown in one study (RR 0.08 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.63])123 but data for the effectiveness of post‐exposure oseltamivir in this setting are lacking.124 Other studies have seen a non‐significant effect of post‐exposure prophylaxis and seasonal prophylaxis with zanamivir.124, 125\\n\", \"Prophylaxis for all residents in LTCFs experiencing an outbreak, regardless of vaccination status is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)3; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) expert opinion on the use of antivirals for prophylaxis recommends consideration of antiviral prophylaxis for residents of LTCFs, especially for those who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised who do not respond to vaccination.126 This may be particularly important during years when IVE is expected to be low due to vaccine strain mismatch. But the relatively low effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the elderly population even in well‐matched years should also be taken into consideration.\", \"There is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of giving prophylaxis to HCWs in LTCFs. The CDC recommends consideration of prophylaxis for unvaccinated HCWs caring for people at high risk of complications, and for all employees regardless of vaccination status if an outbreak is due to a strain which is poorly matched to the current vaccine strains.3 To protect vulnerable people, ECDC also recommends consideration of prophylaxis for HCWs, particularly when low IVE is expected due to strain mismatch.120 As IVE is lower in those who are elderly and frail than in younger healthy people, it would seem prudent to have a low threshold for offering prophylaxis to those caring for them, and particularly so if chains of transmission from a resident to staff are described; or from a resident to staff to resident.\", \"Seasonal influenza infection outbreaks are a significant problem in LTCFs both in terms of morbidity and mortality for individuals as well as putting additional strain on already overburdened health services. With an increasingly elderly population, the demand for LTCFs is likely increase over the coming years. Many basic and clinical questions remain unanswered about the transmission, prevention and treatment of influenza in these institutions and further evidence is needed to determine which interventions, or combination of interventions and hygiene practices are most efficacious in these settings. Although vaccination for residents and staff forms the cornerstone of preventive influenza policy in LTCFs, and vaccine coverage is high among residents in some countries, currently available vaccines are less effective in older people and those with comorbidities. Vaccination coverage among HCWs caring for residents of LTCFs is generally much lower than for those in other priority groups and efforts are required to improve this to protect the vulnerable, the individual HCW and the workforce. Although further studies of the efficacy of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis in LTCF setting are required, available data suggest that antivirals should be used early during the course of infection for treatment of residents and considered for prophylaxis during suspected or confirmed influenza outbreaks to reduce secondary transmission. The prevention and control of influenza in LTCFs requires a multifaceted approach; vaccination and antiviral policies form an important part of this, but strong managerial leadership, outbreak planning, and a well‐trained, educated and engaged workforce are pivotal to the successful implementation of IPC policies.\", \"J.S.N‐V‐T. reports grants from World Health Organization, during the conduct of the study; and grants from F.

According to statistical data, construction and expansion are expected to continue through 2050 with 1.8 − 2.0 billion m2 of floor space every year [2]. These new buildings raise public concerns regarding indoor air quality (IAQ) associated with higher levels of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [3]. A field survey in Hangzhou, China revealed that the average concentration of formaldehyde (HCHO) in new residential buildings after decoration is 9 times higher than the threshold from World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. The dramatic increase of HCHO in indoor environment greatly enhances the risk of exposure risk to human beings that reside in the dwelling. It is hypothesized that significant exposure to high levels of HCHO has contributed to childhood leukemia incidents in China [5], [6]. As an ordinary but effective solution, natural ventilation is being applied to remove or dilute gaseous pollutants in new decorated buildings [7]. In particular, single-sided natural ventilation is more common than cross-ventilation in practice, and can readily satisfy fire codes, security issues and privacy concerns [8].\", \"Single-sided natural ventilation uses openings in the form of windows or ventilation devices on the facade to allow outdoor air to enter and indoor air to leave from the same or different opening [9]. Due to the unique airflow paths created by single-sided ventilation, air can flow between households on different floors in multistory buildings [10]. As a result, there is the possibility of cross-infection via airflow between multistory households if the IAQ of one household is not within the recommended safe limits. Cross-infection was initially found during the outbreak of Smallpox in a German hospital [11]. During the worldwide epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003 [12], [13], [14], cross-infection contributed to the spread of the infectious disease. The SARS virus was found in rooms and windows where residents did not suffer from the disease [15]. It was shown that airborne transmission in certain conditions greatly contributed to the cross-infection of pandemic viruses in residential buildings [16]. With IAQ requirements, greenhouses gases deteriorating the atmosphere, and other environmental concerns, more attention should be focused to reduce pollutant cross-transmission in buildings.\", \"The airborne transmission of pollutants is often driven by three forces, namely, the buoyancy force, wind force and their combination [17]. Niu and Tung [16] employed carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as tracer gases to measure the amount of the exhausted air re-entering upper floor windows due to buoyancy effects. It was found that up to 7% of the exhausted air from the lower floor transferred to the adjacent upper floor. Liu et al. [18] numerically investigated the airborne transmission in a high-rise building with buoyancy-driven ventilation. The results revealed that the windows flush with the building facade became major paths of pollutant cross-transmission. To reduce pollutant transmission between floors, Wu and Niu [19] installed a mechanical exhaust system in each room with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation. It was shown that the outflow through the window was weakened when the mechanical exhaust was employed. If the mechanical exhaust rate was large enough, no indoor air escaped through the window. The two-way airflow through the window turned into one-way inflow, and thus re-entry risk was avoided. Lim et al. [20], [21] further confirmed the possibility of pollutant transmission from lower floors to upper floors through buoyancy-driven airflow by means of field measurement and numerical analysis in a hospital setting. Considering the variety of indoor pollutants, Gao et al. [22] utilized Lagrangian and Eulerian models to simulate particulate (pollutant) transmission between adjacent floors. It was concluded that the upward transmission closely depended on the size of the particulate. If the particulate sizes were larger than 20 μm, the upward transmission was limited by gravitational settling effects.\", \"Compared to pollutant cross-transmission by buoyancy-driven airflow, wind-driven airflow is more complex because of the random nature of wind. Liu et al. [23], [24], [25] measured pollutant transmission and possible cross-infection based on a 1:30 scale model of a 10-story residential building in a wind tunnel. Experimental results indicated that vertical (bidirectional) and horizontal cross-transmission between adjacent flats were both observed. Furthermore, the impacts of transient characteristics of wind on pollutant cross-transmission should be considered when evaluating the risk of cross-infection. To perform accurate numerical predictions on indoor pollutant dispersion around a building, Liu et al. [26] compared three turbulence models based on a high-rise building with 33 floors and 8 units in a prescribed wind field. Obvious differences were observed among the turbulence models, and the simulations based on the realizable k\\n − \\nε model agreed best with experiments. Ai et al. [27], [28], [29] used the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model and the large eddy simulation (LES) model to quantify the dispersion of pollutants during wind-dominated conditions inside and outside a typical multistory building. The results indicated that the incident wind and the balcony created significant changes in the route of airborne transmission and the re-entry ratio of exhaust air.\", \"Owing to the fact that pollutant cross-transmission does not always depend on one force, i.e., buoyancy-driven or wind-driven forces, the combination of these forces may transport pollutant between floors. Gao et al. [30] considered the combination of forces for pollutant cross-transmission in a high-rise building with single-sided natural ventilation. It was found that the wind could reinforce or suppress vertical cross-transmission of pollutants between floors, which was mainly attributed to wind speed and direction. Mao et al. [31] further extended the research in a 33-story building with closed doors and windows. The pollutant cross-transmission between floors was driven by buoyancy and wind effects together. The multi-zone model was developed to analyze pollutant spread in vertical and horizontal directions. The pollutant concentration on the upper floors was 3 − 4 orders of magnitude lower than that on the floor where the source was located. Though the research on pollutant cross-transmission via combined forces has been investigated, it is still far from being fully understood since the characteristics of airflow resulting from the interaction between buoyancy and wind has not been well explained [32].\", \"The above review implies that most attention has focused on experimental measurements and numerical simulations to identify the possible routes of pollutant cross-transmission and quantify the amount of exhausted pollutants re-entering indoor environments. Due to the complex features of airflow inside and outside buildings, there are very few studies that investigate the impact of window configuration; real windows are simplified as rectangular openings. Our previous study demonstrated that there are significant thermal flow differences in natural ventilation with various window configurations [33], which should also affect pollutant cross-transmission accordingly. Therefore, the investigation herein aims to quantify gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in a multistory building with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation through variable window types. The sensitivities of re-entry ratios and infection risks for variable windows are analyzed and compared for pollutant cross-transmission.\", \"To represent pollutant transmission between households through real windows in a multistory building, the geometrical model is illustrated in Fig. 1\\n. The three empty cavities represent rooms on different floors of a multistory building with dimensions of 2.5 m (L) × 3.5 m (W) × 3.2 m (H). Six types of windows that are common in residential buildings are installed on the facade of the building, which include the vertical slide window (VSW), tilt window (TILT), awning window (AW), horizontal pivot window (HPW), turn window (TURN) and vertical pivot window (VPW), as shown in Fig. 2\\n. The sizes of the window frames are identical, with dimensions of 1.23 m (w) × 1.48 m (h). The open area of each window style and corresponding open gap are summarized in Table 1\\n, and represent typical openings in practical conditions. Fig. 2(a) shows an example of the open area A and gap δ for the VSW style; for the other window styles, the gap is the base of the isosceles triangle. Furthermore, the openings of the same window type on each floor are identical for the same case. Since the airflow and pollutant dispersion near a window is of concern, the computational domain only includes the front region of the multistory building and wind is not considered [19]. The height of the computational domain is 12.8 m (4H), which is one floor higher than the building, and its length is 12.5 m (5L) which is large enough to ensure that the computational boundaries do not affect the windows. The pollutant source is located in the center of the first floor room, which is denoted by the character * in Fig. 1. The gaseous HCHO is assumed to be released by the source with a constant mass flow rate that ranges from 10 − 100 μg/s.\", \"To characterize airflow and pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building, the governing equations of fluid flow, heat transfer and scalar transport are solved. Since the equations are widely available from published literature, the following briefly addresses the governing equations employed in the study.\", \"The continuity, momentum and energy equations for an incompressible fluid are written as [34],(1)∇→⋅u→=0\\n(2)ρ(∂u→∂t+u→⋅∇→u→)=−∇→p+μ∇→2u→+ρg→\\n(3)∂T∂t+u→⋅∇→T=Kρcp∇→2Twhere u→ is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, T is the temperature, K is the thermal conductivity, g→ is the gravitational acceleration, ρ is the density, and μ is the absolute viscosity. The Boussinesq model is used to include buoyancy effects caused by variation of air density. It approximates the buoyancy term in Equation (2) as,(4)ρg→=ρref[1-β(T−Tref)]g→where ρ\\nref is the reference density, T\\nref is the operating temperature, and β is the thermal expansion coefficient.\", \"In view of desirable performances in accuracy and stability when modeling turbulence, the BSL k-ω model is used to characterize turbulent airflow [35]. The mathematical descriptions of the BSL k-ω model are given by [36],(5)∂∂t(ρk)+∇→⋅(ρu→k)=∇→⋅(Γk∇→k)+Gk−Yk\\n(6)∂∂t(ρω)+∇→⋅(ρu→ω)=∇→⋅(Γω∇→ω)+Gω−Yω+Dωwhere k is the turbulence kinetic energy, ω is the specific dissipation rate, Гk and Гω represent the diffusivity of k and ω, Gk and Gω represent the generation of k and ω, Yk and Yω represent the dissipation of k and ω, and Dω represents the cross-diffusion term. More details about the BSL k\\n − \\nω model can be found in [33], [36].\", \"Based on the airflow predicted by the mathematical models introduced above, one can continue to solve another equation to obtain characteristics of pollutant transmission in indoor and outdoor environment. Generally, there are two methods for modeling pollutant transmission, i.e., the Eulerian method and the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian method is usually applied to transiently track particle pollutants. Under steady state conditions, both methods can provide reasonable results, while the Eulerian method requires less computing time than the Lagrangian method [37]. Since the densities of air and gaseous HCHO are similar, they can be considered as a passive pollutant. Therefore, the Eulerian method is suitable to quantify passive pollutant transmission. The following scalar transport equation is utilized to model the pollutant transmission [34],(7)∇→⋅(ρu→C)=∇→⋅(ΓC∇→C)+SCwhere C is the concentration of the scalar (HCHO), SC is the source term, and ГC is the scalar diffusivity as proposed by Zhang et al. [38] where ГC\\n = (μ + μ\\nt)/St for St = 1.0. Further details on the scalar transport equation can be found in [34].\", \"ANSYS Fluent (Version 16.0) is used simulate the flow through windows and predict pollutant transmission. The governing equations are discretized using the finite-volume method. The discretization for continuity, momentum, energy, turbulence and scalar are all second-order upwind schemes. The pressure staggering option (PRESTO!) scheme is employed for pressure interpolation. The pressure and velocity is coupled using the semi-implicit pressure linked equation (SIMPLE) algorithm. Convergence criteria of 10−5 are used for all variables. Each case is solved using the steady state form of the equations except for the second validation case. When simulating the transient solution, the time step is set to 0.5 s to satisfy the Courant number of unity. The boundary conditions for the building and computational domain are summarized in Table 2\\n. In the building, the no-slip condition is imposed on all solid surfaces. Temperatures are specified for the side walls and floor, while the front wall and ceiling are specified as adiabatic. In the computational domain, temperature and ambient pressure are specified at the topmost plane. No-slip and adiabatic boundary conditions are employed on the ground. As shown in Fig. 1, the left and right sides of the external domain in the z\\n \\n−\\n \\ny planes are symmetric boundaries, which replicate multiple dwellings on a floor. The x\\n \\n−\\n \\ny plane at the computational boundary of the ambient region is specified as a free-slip boundary with different temperatures to represent different ambient conditions.\", \"The geometry and mesh were created using Gambit (Version 2.3.16), and hexahedral cells were generated with the ‘submap’ scheme. A grid resolution study was performed using cells with average lengths of 2.5 cm (fine), 5.0 cm (medium) and 10 cm (coarse). Changes in velocity and temperature were examined and it was found that the discretization error for the medium-to-fine was 4.25% using a Richardson extrapolation [39], [40]. Hence, the simulations will use the medium grid for the analysis herein. Further details about the grid resolution can be found in [33].\", \"The study begins by validating the CFD predictions with data from two experiments. One experiment is from Jiang and Chen [41], who provided velocity and temperature profiles that we use to demonstrate the accuracy of the CFD model to predict natural ventilation. The other is an experiment by Grabe et al. [42], which provides profiles of tracer gas inside the building with buoyancy-driven ventilation and will validate the CFD model for gaseous pollutant transmission.\", \"In the experiment by Jiang and Chen [41], two chambers represented the indoor and outdoor environments, as shown in Fig. 3\\n(a). The buoyancy-driven ventilation was generated through a baseboard heater inside the test chamber and a rectangular window was located opposite to the baseboard heater. The air velocity and temperature at five locations (P1 − P5) inside and outside the test chamber were measured. The experimental data from two positions (P2, P5) in the test chamber were used to validate the CFD model in the study. More details on the experiment can be found in [41]. However, specific experimental uncertainty was not provided so the data will not be represented with error bars. Fig. 3(b) − (e) compare the predictions for velocity and temperature with the measured data at P2 and P5. In general, the velocity and temperature profiles are in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the CFD model is able to provide acceptable predictions of thermal flow profiles for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation.\", \"In the study by Grabe et al. [42], the experiment consists of a test chamber and an environmental chamber, as shown in Fig. 4\\n(a). The dimensions of the test chamber have a length of 2.5 m, width of 3.5 m and height of 3.2 m. The dimension of the environmental chamber exceeds that of the test chamber, but the specific size of the environmental chamber was not provided. A vertical slide window with a 1.23 m width and 1.48 m height was located on the front wall of the test chamber. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the tracer gas and was injected into the test chamber with the window closed before measurements were taken. The tracer gases of CO2 and SF6 are the most frequently applied tracer gases in ventilation measurements, which are both colorless gases with densities larger than that of air [43], [44]. The test chamber was heated by an electrical heating unit. Once CO2 concentrations reached 4000 ppm inside the test chamber and the temperature difference between the two chambers was 8 °C, CO2 injection and electrical heating ceased, the window was opened and the measurements began. CO2 concentration in the center of the test chamber at different heights was measured during the buoyancy-driven ventilation.\", \"\\nFig. 4(b)–(e) compare the computed CO2 concentration with the experimental data at different heights at the center of the test chamber. Due to the lack of information of the environmental chamber, two types of boundary conditions were tested with the CFD modeling. One condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was open to ambient conditions and pressure was specified (BC-open). The second condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was a no-slip wall (BC-close). As shown in Fig. 4(b)–(e), the CO2 concentration generally decreases with time during ventilation. Compared to the decay of CO2 at y\\n = 2.8 m, the CO2 concentration at y\\n \\n=\\n 0.4 m decreases faster at the initial stage (t\\n = 0 − 800s). The concentration of CO2 predicted by the CFD model is in good agreement with experimental data at the initial stage. However, the CFD predictions gradually deviate from measurements as the time continues. The CFD predictions suggest that the boundary condition that specified ambient pressure is more similar to the experimental conditions. Although neither boundary condition tested perfectly agrees with the experimental data, and not knowing the exact experimental conditions, the CFD modeling can be considered reliable.\", \"As shown in Fig. 4(b)–(e), the discrepancy may be attributed to the specification of the external domain which represents the environmental chamber. When the no-slip boundary (close) is employed at the top of the external domain, the CO2 exhausted from the test chamber cannot be removed from the external domain, increasing the CO2 background concentration. However, the CO2 exhausted from the test chamber can be removed from the external domain over time if the ambient boundary (open) is specified at the top of the external domain, thus maintaining a lower CO2 concentration. Owing to that, the size of external domain highly affects the background concentration of CO2 entering into the test chamber. Unfortunately, the dimension of the environmental chamber was not given in the experiment [42]. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to use the scalar transport equation to predict gaseous pollutant transmission via buoyancy-driven airflow.\", \"\\nFig. 5\\ncompares the predicted velocity, temperature, concentration and mass flow rate profiles for different ambient temperatures; the profiles are taken along a line that runs directly through the center of the room on each floor. Since VSW is one of the most general window types and can produce the largest ventilation rate among the six windows, as discussed in [33], the impacts of the ambient temperature and released pollutant on cross-transmission are presented using the VSW as an example. The VSW configuration is modeled with an open area of 0.8733 m2 and the release rate of the target pollutant (HCHO) is 20 μg/s. The reason of setting the value of the pollutant release rate will be explained in Sect. 3.1. To improve the comparability of numerical results, the parameters are non-dimensionalized as,(8)y*=y/H\\n(9)u*=u/gH\\n(10)T*=(T−T∞)/(Ts−T∞)\\n(11)C*=(C−Cmin)/(Cmax−Cmin)\\n(12)M*=M/(ρWHRoΔT)where y is the vertical coordinate, H is the floor height, W is the building width, ΔT is the indoor-outdoor temperature difference, M is the mass flow rate of air passing through the window, Ro is the air constant, the subscripts s and ∞ denote the surrounding surfaces and ambient environment, respectively, and the subscripts min and max denote the maximum and minimum values, respectively.\", \"As illustrated in the pollutant profiles of Fig. 5, the indoor velocity, concentration and mass flow rate generally increase when the ambient temperature decreases, while the indoor temperature shows an opposite variation. The pollutant distribution on the first floor and the two upper floors differ greatly because the pollutant source is located in the center of the first floor room. The concentration around the pollutant source is the largest, and the maximum concentration on each floor appears at the height of air inflow, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The comparison demonstrates that ambient temperature does not produce an obvious impact on the basic characteristics of thermal flow and concentration profiles. To compare the results with our previous research [33] and subsequently determine the best window configuration that minimizes cross-transmission, the ambient temperature is specified as 20 °C in the remainder of the study.\", \"\\nFig. 6\\ncompares the computed concentration profiles with different release rates of the HCHO source for the VSW case (A\\n2\\n = 0.8733 m2, \\nT\\n∞\\n = 20 °C). The average concentration of HCHO inside the building obviously increases with increasing release rate for each floor, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Since the HCHO source is located on the first floor, the average concentration inside shows the most drastic response to the variation of the release rate. According to the threshold for indoor HCHO suggested by WHO (81 ppb), the average concentration in the first floor room is 1.4 − 13.1 times the threshold. As introduced by Guo et al. [4], the HCHO level in new residential buildings after decoration was found to be over 9 times higher than the threshold. Therefore, modeled a pollutant source of 80 μg/s for the VSW case (A\\n2) can best represent the real condition based on the WHO threshold. The average concentrations for the second and the third floor are 62 ppb and 11 ppb in the case of I\\n \\n=\\n 80 μg/s, which are 0.77 and 0.15 times the threshold, respectively. If the release rate of the source pollutant increases slightly, the HCHO concentration in the second floor room may be over the threshold, and the level in the third floor room will become worse as well. Therefore, human beings on the upper floor adjacent to the first floor (with the pollutant source) in the multistory building risk cross-infection during single-sided natural ventilation.\", \"\\nFig. 6(b) presents the dimensionless concentration profiles along a line through the center of the rooms and corresponds to different release rates of the HCHO source. Most notably, the profiles collapse and demonstrate that the trends do not change, irrespective of release rate; only the magnitudes change for the raw data. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the specification of the pollutant release rate will not affect obtaining basic characteristics of gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in the multistory building. Due to that, the release rate of the pollutant source is specified as 20 μg/s for the remainder of the study.\", \"As defined by ASHRAE Handbook [45], the air change rate per hour (ACH) compares the airflow rate Q to the volume of the corresponding space​\\n (i.e., ACH = \\nQ/​\\n). As shown in Fig. 7\\n(a) − (c), the ACH for each floor increases with increasing open area for each window type. The ventilation performances of each window type on the first and second floor are very similar, and minor differences are present on the third floor. In general, the VSW and HPW perform best in terms of ventilating the multistory building, followed by the TURN, VPW and TILT. The AW style always performs the worst among the six window types except when the window open area is less than 0.5 m2 on the first floor, and then TILT performs the worst as shown in Fig. 7(a). On the second and third floor of the multistory building, the performance of the TILT is better than that of the AW owing to the upward airflow in front of the facade induced by the plane of the TILT, as shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c). On the first floor of the multistory building, the performances of the TILT and AW are more similar and change with the open area of the window. These findings are consistent to our previous work on ventilation performances of various window types in a one-story building, as shown in Fig. 7(d) [33].\", \"\\nFig. 8\\npresents the average HCHO concentration for each floor comparing open area. The average HCHO concertation decreases with increasing open area for each window type. Note that the maximum values along the abscissa are different in Fig. 8 because the first floor levels are significantly higher and the third floor levels are significantly lower. However, the pollutant concentrations on a particular floor with different window types show pronounced differences on the second floor, although the open window areas and release rates of HCHO are equal. This can be attributed to the window style that impacts ventilation rates. As shown in Fig. 8, the average concentration of HCHO for the HPW case in each floor is not the smallest among the six window cases. However, the corresponding ventilation rate for the HPW case is still the largest, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, the window configuration affects the pollutant transmission between floors in multistory buildings. The HCHO concentration decays with increasing floor level with the same window type. From the first floor to the second floor to the third floor, the average HCHO concentration can reach magnitudes of 100 − 1000, 10 − 100 and 10, respectively. Clearly, the performance of various windows on preventing airborne pollutant re-entering upper floors are different. Among the six window types, the VPW, TILT and TURN styles generally do not perform well and thus does not adequately restrict the pollutant from re-entering upper floors. In contrast, the VSW and HPW styles perform better but the AW style presents the best performance on restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates.\", \"To further illustrate the impact of window configurations on pollutant transmission between floors in the multistory building, Fig. 9\\npresents HCHO distributions at the central x-plane for different window types with the same open area (Ai\\n = 0.8733 m2). As shown in Fig. 9, the HCHO profiles inside and outside the building are sensitive to window styles. By considering the configurations of the VSW and HPW styles, the TURN, VPW and TILT styles present similar characteristics of HCHO distributions because similar transmission paths are created by windows. Among the six windows, the AW style performs the best with low pollutant transmission since the upward airflow is prevented by the window pane. In contrast, the TILT, TURN and VPW styles are not as effective in reducing pollutant cross transmission because the window pane does not redirect the flow. Therefore, the HCHO concentrations in the upper floor rooms for these three window cases are relatively higher. The HCHO concentration reduces by nearly one order of magnitude between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors for each window style, while the reduction between the second floor and the third floor is much less than that between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors.\", \"To better understand different window performances on the pollutant transmission between floors, Fig. 10\\npresents thermal flow profiles at the central x-plane for three cases. Among the six window types, the AW style shows the best performance for restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates. The VSW and HPW styles perform adequately, and the VPW, TILT and TURN types perform the worst. Considering the performances of each window and the characteristics of pollutant distribution, only the thermal flow profiles corresponding to VSW, AW and TURN are presented. The velocity streamlines near the windows provide a visual understanding of how the pollutant transports through the openings. The upward flow is obviously restricted by the window pane in the AW case, controlling the exhausted pollutant from re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The TURN style directs the air toward the window opening such that the air exhausted from each floor cascades along the facade and thus enhances the air re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(c). Compared to the TURN case, the air path passing through each floor window is better separated in the VSW case, so the indoor pollutant cross-transmission is reduced as well, as shown in Fig. 10(a). The thermal flow profiles for the VSW provides the best ACH ventilation rates, and the overall mean velocity is higher and the temperature is lower than the other cases. The TURN case performs adequately but the velocity field demonstrates reduced circulation, and thus lower ACH but the temperatures are reasonable.\", \"The results presented thus far indicate that possibility of pollutants flowing between adjacent floors. Therefore, the infection risk of a pandemic virus through cross-transmission in multistory buildings with flush windows on the same facade cannot be neglected. To quantify the infection risk caused by cross-transmission, the amount of the air exhausted from the first floor (source) entering upper floors can be determined. As proposed by Niu and Tung [16], the parameter of re-entry ratio that represents the fraction of the exhausted air from the source floor to upper floors can be defined as,(13)ηR=Cave,RQRCave,SRQSRwhere η\\nR is the re-entry ratio, C\\nave is the average pollutant concentration in that floor, Q is the volume flow rate, R is the floor number (1, 2, 3, etc.), and SR is the floor with the source.\", \"\\nFig. 11\\npresents the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air from the source floor entering the upper floors. As shown in Fig. 11, the re-entry ratio for the second floor is generally larger than that for the third floor because of the smaller transmission distance from the pollutant source. In the second floor room, the re-entry ratios for HPW and TURN cases increase progressively with the ACH, while that for the VSW case exhibits a monotonic decrease. In contrast, the re-entry ratios for the TILT and VPW cases fluctuate with ACH, but the re-entry ratio for the AW case remains constant with ACH. Similarly, various window types are not able to present consistent behaviors in re-entry ratios in the third floor room. Notice that the TILT style always presents the largest re-entry ratio among the six windows, which is most likely because the upward airflow is not restricted by the structure of the window itself. Moreover, the window pane is angled toward the indoor environment and induces the pollutant to re-enter. Thus, the window configurations should be carefully considered for cross-transmission, especially in the control of cross-infection of pandemic virus via airborne transmission, as well as acceptable ventilation.\", \"\\nFig. 11.\", \"Based on the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air entering the upper floors, the infection risk of a pandemic virus via airborne transmission can be estimated by the Wells-Riley equation [46]. The Wells-Riley model was initially proposed in an epidemiological study on measles outbreak, which was based on the quantum theory of infection. A quantum was defined as the number of airborne pathogens required to infect a person. By considering the intake dose of airborne pathogens in terms of the number of quanta to evaluate the probability of escaping the infection, the Wells-Riley equation is derived as [46], [47], [48],(14)P=1−exp(−nrξt0Q)where P is the infection risk, n is the number of infectors, r is the quantum generation rate, ξ is the breathing rate, Q is the volume flow rate of the space, and t\\n0 is the exposure time. Notice that the Wells-Riley equation was originally applied to evaluate the risk of infection for one room. When it is applied to assess the risk of cross-infection in a multistory building with several rooms, the quantum generation rate for the receptor rooms can be determined based on the re-entry ratio [30], [49]. Therefore, the Wells-Riley equation is rewritten as,(15)PR=1−exp(−nrηRξt0QR)\\n\", \"The quantum generation rate r in Equation (15) cannot be directly obtained, which is generally estimated from a specific outbreak case of pandemic virus. The breathing rate ξ and the exposure time t\\n0 can be specified based on the detailed information of infectors. In our study, the parameters n, r, ξ and t\\n0 are specified according to the work by Gao et al. [30]. In their study [30], the infection risk in a high-rise building with single-sided ventilation driven by the combination of wind and buoyancy forces was assessed. To illustrate the differences of the infection risk caused by different forces, the parameters for our present study are n\\n = 1, r\\n = 13 quanta/h, ξ\\n = 0.6 m3/h, t\\n0\\n = 8 h. It is assumed that an infector stands in the center of the first floor room, and the virus transmission is between the source floor and the second floor and between the source floor and the third floor.\", \"\\nFig. 12\\npresents the relationship of infection risk versus ACH for different floors. As shown in Fig. 12(a), the infection risks for different window configurations are almost identical in the first floor room due to the amount of virus released by the infector. However, the infection risks for window styles on the second and third floors are different from each other. Obviously, the infection risks for TILT, VSW and VPW cases are relatively higher when the ACH is small in the second floor room. With increasing ACH, the differences between window styles gradually decrease, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b). On the third floor, the infection risk for each window style further decreases the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air, as shown in Fig. 12(c).\", \"\\nFig. 12(d) presents the infection risk in the case of airborne transmission driven by a combination of buoyancy and wind forces determined by Gao et al. [30]. As shown in Fig. 12(d), the infection risks in the floor room where the infector is located (i.e., source floor) and the receptor room (i.e., upper floor) present similar orders of magnitudes to our study. On the source floor, the infection risk decreases with increasing ACH although ambient wind is considered in Gao et al., which is the same as our findings on the first floor (i.e., source floor). The largest risk of infection is 6.6% on the upper floor when the wind is 2 m/s, which corresponds to the highest re-entry ratio of the exhausted air but does not correspond to the smallest ACH. Therefore, the wind in practical conditions may either reinforce or suppress the pollutant cross-transmission. To represent realistic performances of window configurations on cross-transmission, the incident wind must be carefully considered in future research.\", \"A computational study investigated gaseous pollutant transmission through variable window styles between vertical floors in a multistory building with buoyancy-driven, single-sided natural ventilation. Detailed characteristics of airflow and pollutant distributions inside and outside the building were obtained using CFD. It was shown that it was reasonable to combine the RANS model and a scalar transport equation to solve passive pollutant transmission. The CFD predictions were compared with experiments by Jiang and Chen [41] and Grabe et al. [42] to substantiate the computational models employed.\", \"Six window styles were examined to determine their performance with reducing pollutant cross-transmission to rooms above the source room. The ACH generally increased with increasing open area for each window style. However, there was a decrease in average pollutant concentration with the increasing window open area. The pollutant concentration reduced one order of magnitude between the source floor and the upper floors for each window style. Furthermore, the pollutant concentration on different floors was not only affected by the ventilation rate but also by the window configuration. Among the six window types, the AW style showed the best performance for restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it was not able to provide larger ventilation rates. The VSW and HPW styles performed adequately and the VPW, TILT and TURN types performed the worst.\", \"It was further shown that the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air re-entering the upper floors generally decreased with increasing floor for each window type. The risk of infection was shown to decrease when evaluated using the Wells-Riley model. Coupled with the previous conclusions, the infection risk can also be controlled by ventilation rate and window configuration. Therefore, window configuration and the ventilation rate should be considered together to reduce the risk of infection in practice.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778817318303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817318303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288118/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC3850527\",\n  doi: \"10.1186/1471-2458-13-897\",\n  title: \"Multi-criteria decision analysis as an innovative approach to managing zoonoses: results from a study on Lyme disease in Canada\",\n  doc_date: \"2013-09-30\",\n  authors: [\"Cécile.Aenishaenslin\", \"Valérie.Hongoh\", \"Hassane.Cissé\", \"Anne.Hoen\", \"Karim.Samoura\", \"Pascal.Michel\", \"Jean-Philippe.Waaub\", \"Denise.Bélanger\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Background\", \"Background\", \"Background\", \"Background\", \"Background\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Methods\", \"Problem definition and identification of stakeholders (Steps 1 & 2) ::: Results\", \"Criteria (Steps 3 & 4) ::: Results\", \"Strategies and interventions (Step 5) ::: Results\", \"Evaluation of performance parameters (Step 6) ::: Results\", \"Weighting of criteria (Step 7) ::: Results\", \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\", \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\", \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\", \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Discussion\", \"Conclusions\", \"Abbreviations\", \"Competing interests\", \"Authors’ contributions\", \"Pre-publication history\", \"Pre-publication history\"],\n      generic: [\"references\", \"references\", \"references\", \"references\", \"references\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\", \"references\", \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\", \"references\", \"method\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Zoonoses, and more generally infectious diseases arising from the interaction of human populations with animals and the environment, are a growing international public health threat that is likely to increase with ongoing globalisation and climate change. Currently, these diseases represent three quarters of all recognized emerging infectious diseases [1]. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza and SARS had expensive and multi-sectoral consequences across continents [2,3]. The worldwide emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and West Nile virus (WNv) in North America are two additional examples of such diseases that have caused widespread concern with the general public and decision makers [4,5].\", \"Interacting at the human-animal-environment interface, zoonoses that involve vectors and wildlife species have particular characteristics making them difficult to prevent and control. On the one hand, they involve multiple species, often with complex ecologies, making control or eradication very difficult. On the other hand, because of this ecological complexity, preventive and control interventions of zoonoses can have environmental, social and economic impacts. For example, larvicides used in attempts to control WNv during the 1999–2007 outbreak in Canada were found to be toxic for some wild bird and fish species, and their use was publicly criticized by local media and experts [6]. Moreover, zoonoses pose important prevention and control challenges because multiple organisations and stakeholders share responsibilities with regards to public health actions; however, the implementation and anticipated effects of cross-sectoral interventions can be more difficult to predict for strategic planners and decision-makers. This complexity calls for transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches in order to achieve effective disease management, a call which can no longer be ignored [7].\", \"A “One Health” approach is needed to develop effective management for zoonoses. The “One Health” approach recognizes the intimate linkages between human, animal and environmental health systems and proposes an international, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral approach to disease surveillance, monitoring, prevention, control and mitigation of emerging and re-emerging diseases [8]. In recent years, this approach has been adopted by several national and international organisations as a promising way to improve public health interventions [9,10].\", \"Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods come from the field of operations research and are commonly used in environmental, industrial and business management [11,12]. Multiple MCDA algorithms exist to analyse different types of decision problems, one of which consists of ranking and comparing alternatives based on multiple criteria that can be evaluated using either quantitative and/or qualitative indicators [13]. In the absence of quantitative data for a criterion in a specific context, MCDA methods allow for the incorporation of qualitative evaluations, for example based on expert opinion. Moreover, it offers the possibility, if needed, for a participatory approach with stakeholders concerned by a particular issue, allowing them to actively engage in all stages of the decision analysis supported by MCDA. As such, MCDA methods are well suited for complex, transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral decision-making problems such as zoonotic disease management [14,15]. The use of MCDA in public health has thus far been limited but is emerging as a complementary method for evidence-based public health [16-18]. It has been used in different contexts, such as for the prioritization of general health issues, including zoonoses [17-23], and to compare potential alternatives or interventions for public health management. For this later goal, most published studies have been in the field of environmental health, but some more recent studies were done to prioritize interventions for infectious diseases management [24-26]. Fewer studies have attempted to confront zoonotic or animal related disease problems with an MCDA approach: one such study used MCDA to compare strategies for the elimination of carcasses following a hypothetical event of food-industry targeted terrorism [27], another used MCDA to compare different methods of quarantine and control during animal disease epidemics [28,29]. Hongoh and colleagues [30] proposed a general model and discussed the potential strengths of the use of MCDA methods for vector-borne disease management with explicit spatial considerations.\", \"Lyme disease, a zoonosis caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans via the bites of ticks infected from animal reservoirs, is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in temperate countries and is a good example of a public health issue at the human-animal-environment interface [31]. The incidence of Lyme disease has been increasing annually in North America, particularly in the north-eastern United States where more than 20,000 cases are reported annually [31]. In the Canadian province of Quebec, the incidence of Lyme disease has thus far been low (0.5 per 100 000 in 2011 according to a recent report by the Quebec National Institute of Public Health [32] compared to rates of 60.3, 67.3 and 76 per 100 000 in the same year in the neighbouring states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont respectively [33]), but could grow to 8 000 cases annually by 2050 in the southeast and the central southern parts of Canada [34-37]. The first autochtonous human case of Lyme disease in Quebec was reported in 2008 (Quebec National Institute of Public Health, unpublished observations). Black legged tick populations, the vector of B. burgdorferi, are now recognized as having become established in the southern part of the province, with up to 13% of ticks infected with B. burgdorferi[37]. Given these changing dynamics, the Quebec public health authorities have expressed the desire to proactively respond to this public health concern and to develop a Lyme disease management plan. As such, this is an ideal context for the use of MCDA methods for zoonotic disease management. In the Quebec health system, public health responsibilities, including Lyme disease prevention, are shared between provincial and regional public authorities. The Ministry of Health and Social Services, supported by the National Institute of Public Health in Quebec, is the provincial authority and first level responsible for applying provincial public health programs in collaboration with regional authorities [38]. Each of the 18 administrative regions of the province has their own Health and Social Services Agency. No province-wide program for Lyme disease management currently exists due to the fact that the disease is presently only concentrated in the southern part of Quebec and has affected only a few regions. This article aims to present the context, goals, methods and results from a study of the use of MCDA for Lyme disease management in Quebec, Canada.\", \"The study was conducted between September 2010 and February 2012 with the general objective of identifying, evaluating and ranking different strategies for Lyme disease management in Quebec, in order to support decision-making and program direction by public health authorities. A research team composed of senior and junior researchers active in the fields of public health, veterinary public health and decision analysis research was assembled specifically for this study.\", \"Three main intervention areas were first identified to address Lyme disease management in a comprehensive manner (see the result section for the detailed research questions): preventive communication strategies (COMM), surveillance strategies (SURV) and control strategies (CONT). Preventive communication strategies refers to all modes of communication implemented by public health authorities to prevent Lyme disease in humans; surveillance strategies refers to vector, animal and human related surveillance activities designed to monitor the disease and the state of the infection in the reservoir and the vector; and control strategies refers to field interventions which can be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission of the infectious agent to humans. This article will focus on the results from the MCDA approach applied to the ranking of surveillance and control strategies. Analyses of communication strategies with MCDA will not be presented in the present paper as they required a slightly different methodological framework. The term ‘intervention’ will be use to refer to the specific strategies included in this study for surveillance and control.\", \"The MCDA process used for this study can be divided into ten general steps, each with specific methods (Figure 1). These ten steps are non-linear and may require a few iterations. For example, the identification and inclusion of certain strategies in the model can lead to the inclusion of additional stakeholders in the group as was the case for our project. A participatory approach (focus groups, individual interviews, questionnaires) with a group of stakeholders was adopted for this study. A stakeholder was defined as a person representing an organisation or a group with direct responsibilities or with specific interests in Lyme disease management. This included representatives of governmental or non-governmental organisations, health professionals and experts (different from the research team). Stakeholders were asked to represent the preferences of their organisation and not their own preferences. To make this possible, they were invited to consult other colleagues in their organisation throughout the MCDA process. Stakeholders participated most intensively in the problem definition stage, identification of the extended stakeholders group, identification of key decision issues, translation of these issues into measurable criteria, identification of Lyme disease intervention strategies (steps 1 to 5) and weighting of the criteria (step 7).\", \"The identification of issues (step 3), the definition of criteria (step 4) and the selection of interventions (step 5) were done using an iterative process with the stakeholders: the research group proposed a first set of interventions and criteria along with their definitions, indicators for each criteria and appropriate measurement scales based on their understanding of the major surveillance and control issues for Lyme disease. This initial set was discussed and modified by the stakeholders by means of a focus group discussion. The final versions of the criteria (name, definition, indicator, measurement scales) and interventions lists were then validated by each stakeholder using a web-based questionnaire.\", \"The evaluation of performance parameters for the retained list of interventions was carried out over each criterion (step 6) using literature supported data when available. When data were not available to evaluate parameters for criteria, Delphi surveys were conducted with stakeholders (CONT model) and external experts (SURV model). If there was no consensus on parameters after two iterations of the Delphi process, the mean value was selected. For the CONT model, selected stakeholders and members of the research team were consulted as experts for the determination of parameters. For the SURV model, a group of three external experts in Lyme surveillance were consulted.\", \"Individual weighting of all criteria was done by each stakeholder under two different scenarios (step 7). The first scenario described the current epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Quebec (referred to as “emergence scenario”). The second scenario described a hypothetical substantial increase in the annual number of human cases of Lyme disease in Quebec, coupled with more intensive media coverage and public awareness (referred to as “epidemic scenario”). Each stakeholder was asked to create model-specific weighting schemes based on the stakeholder’s perceived importance of criteria for decision-making in line with their organisational affiliation. This was done by first distributing 100 points among the criteria categories and then re-distributing the category specific points to all criteria within each category. A tool was created using Excel software version 2007 to facilitate this exercise. Individual support was offered to stakeholders to complete the weighting when needed to ensure a good comprehension of the process.\", \"Decision analysis (steps 8 to 10) was carried out in D-Sight (software version 3.3.2) which uses the PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) methods and gives access to the GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid) visual model to explore analysis results [39-41]. PROMETHEE methods enable fully comparative rankings of a set of alternatives [11]. The decision map, which is called a GAIA plan and is generated by the D-sight software, is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a stakeholder’s position, dictated by their individual preferences (ranking of interventions). The decision map is referenced with a decision axis (in red), which points toward the “best” interventions in accordance with the group scores of interventions on all included criteria. The proximity of stakeholder’s positions within the GAIA plan represents proximity in their overall preferences. This graphical representation of stakeholder values can be used to identify potential coalitions or clusters of positions among stakeholders and to identify positions that are distinctive from that of other stakeholders by their distances in relation to others or to the decision axis. Similarly to positioning stakeholders, the GAIA plan also positions all interventions in relation to the overall decision axis. Multi-criteria analyses carried out in D-sight assess the performance of interventions over all criteria resulting in numerical scores for each intervention. D-sight uses specific algorithms based on a pair wise method of analysis to calculate scores (PROMETHEE I and II) [33]. The intervention scores and weighting schemes set by stakeholders can be combined to produce three sets of results of particular interest in our study: 1) group rankings of the interventions, representing an ordered ranking of most preferred to least preferred intervention that takes all weighting schemes and intervention performance scores into account; 2) individual rankings for each stakeholder, representing the most preferred to least preferred intervention for a particular stakeholder given their specific weighting scheme; and 3) individual performance of interventions for every criterion, showing how an intervention performs on every criterion independently of all stakeholder weighting schemes. Intervention scores represent the relative performance of an intervention with respect to another, and as such scores do not have individual meanings by themselves. The objective of these scores is to provide a common numeric value to enable comparisons of interventions. Further details on MCDA methods have been published by Figueira and colleagues [42].\", \"Analyses presented in this paper include group rankings and individual performance of selected interventions, as well as decision maps of stakeholder’s preferences for particular interventions (GAIA planes), and an example of a sensitivity analysis of one stakeholder’s weighting schemes. Each of the 10 MCDA steps was conducted separately for each intervention area (SURV and CONT). Results for the first 5 steps will be presented using SURV and CONT models and a more in depth illustration will be presented for steps 6 to 10 using the CONT model.\", \"To address the general problem of identifying, evaluating and ranking different strategies for Lyme disease management in Quebec, five governmental and one academic organisations involved in Lyme disease management were identified and invited to participate in the MCDA process. Eight representative stakeholders agreed to participate. The composition of the group was defined in order to capture the multidisciplinary nature of Lyme management (Table 1). For the examination of surveillance and control strategies, two models were developed to address two specific research questions identified by the stakeholders: 1) what strategies are most effective for Lyme disease surveillance? (SURV model); and 2) what interventions are most effective for the prevention and control of Lyme disease? (CONT model). In the context of this study, effectiveness represents the overall relative performance of strategies and interventions over multiple decision criteria, taking into account their importance as defined by the stakeholders for the Quebec context.\", \"Sixteen criteria were selected for the two models to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions relative to the main issues of Lyme surveillance and control (Table 2). These criteria were divided into five general categories: public health criteria (PHC), animal and environmental health criteria (AEC), social impact criteria (SIC), strategic, economic and operational impact criteria (SEC) and surveillance criteria (SUC). Indicators were defined for each criterion and used qualitative scales for measurement. Categorical ordinal scales were used for all criteria, except for AEC1 and AEC2 where a multiplicative indicator was defined.\", \"For the SURV model, 11 interventions were identified and consisted of various passive and active surveillance strategies targeting vectors, domestic animals and humans: passive surveillance of vectors found on humans (SURV1a) and animals (SURV1b); active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging (SURV2a), by trapping of small rodents (SURV2b) and from hunted deer (SURV2c); passive surveillance of domestic animals seropositive cases of B. burgdorferi funded by the animal owners (SURV3a), funded by the private sector (industry) (SURV3c) or funded by the public sector (SURV3b); active surveillance of cases of Lyme disease in domestic animals (SURV4); passive surveillance of suspected and confirmed cases of Lyme disease in humans (SURV5); sentinel surveillance of suspected cases in humans (SURV6). For the CONT model, 16 interventions were selected, again with the aim to compare different approaches for Lyme disease prevention and control targeting vectors, vector hosts and human populations. Vector targeted interventions included: small (CONT1a) and large (CONT1b) scale acaricide applications, dessicants/insecticidal soap applications (CONT2), removal of tick habitats by small scale landscaping bordering houses and alleys (CONT3a) or by large scale landscaping in public forested areas (CONT3b). Vector host targeted interventions included: the use of ‘4-poster’ device to control tick infestation on deer (CONT4) or feed-administered ivermectin (CONT5), reduction of deer populations by increased hunting quotas (CONT6a), by culling (CONTb), or by exclusion of deer from public areas (CONT7), tick control on small rodents by ‘Damminix’ device (CONT8) or fipronil application (CONT9). Human population targeted interventions included: exclusion of people from high risk areas (CONT10), vaccination (CONT11), development of Lyme disease clinics to facilitate diagnostic and treatment (CONT12)). All selected CONT interventions have been used in the past to prevent and control Lyme disease in experimental or real life contexts. A ‘status quo’ intervention (CONT0) was also included to represent a ‘no additional measures taken’ option where only a basic public communications strategy for Lyme disease prevention is provided by public health authorities with dissemination via web sites and occasional press releases.\", \"Each intervention was evaluated on each of the selected criteria using the defined measurement scales and resulting in the creation of two performance matrices, one for each model (Table 3). Performance parameters on criteria varied depending on the intervention. For example, CONT1b (large scale acaricide application) had the highest parameter value (equal to 48) for criterion AEC1 (impact on habitat), meaning that this intervention would have the highest impact on habitat among all interventions included in the matrix. CONT0 (status quo), CONT11 (vaccination) and CONT12 (development of Lyme disease clinics to facilitate diagnostic and treatment) had the lowest parameter values for criterion AEC1 (equal to 1), meaning that these interventions would have the lowest impact on habitat.\", \"The weighting of the retained criteria varied in accordance with stakeholder values in each of the models and varied between both scenarios (Table 4). Public health was the category which generally received the highest weighting. For the CONT model, under the epidemic scenario, five stakeholders (S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7) gave additional weight to the public health criteria at the expense of other categories. For example, stakeholder S4 respectively assigned 30, 25, 25 and 20 points to the public health, animal and environmental impacts, social impacts and strategic, economic and operational criteria categories under the emergence scenario, but assigned weightings of 40, 25, 25 and 10 points under the epidemic scenario for the same categories.\", \"Group rankings of interventions were performed for both models using the individual stakeholder’s values expressed via criteria weightings (Table 5). Group scores ranged from −0.34 to 0.45 for the SURV model and from −0.33 to 0.43 for the CONT model. For both models, the three preferred interventions were the same regardless of the epidemiological scenario (emergence or epidemic). For the SURV model, the three preferred interventions were SURV2a (active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging), SURV2b (active surveillance of vectors by trapping of small rodents) and SURV1a (passive surveillance of vectors of human origin). For the CONT model, CONT0 (status quo – basic preventive communications), CONT11 (human vaccination) and CONT3a (small scale landscaping) were the three preferred interventions. CONT6b (deer culling) and CONT6a (deer hunting) were classified as the least preferable interventions under both scenarios.\", \"The GAIA plan decision map presented in Figure 2 shows the relative position of stakeholders with respect to the decision axis (in red) and selected interventions for the control model (CONT) under the “emergence scenario”. Stakeholder’s positions (represented by S1-8 in this figure) are determined by the combination of the intrinsic performance of interventions and by the stakeholder’s weighting scheme. The closer a stakeholder is to the decision axis (for example S2 and S7 in this map), the more important their agreement with the best consensual interventions (i.e. first ranked interventions), and vice-versa. Interventions located close to the decision axis (CONT0, CONT3a and CONT11 in Figure 2) are the preferred interventions for the group, and correspond to the three best ranked interventions in Table 5. A long decision axis indicates strong decision choice power whereas a short decision axis indicates that the compromise solution is close to the origin [42]. The worst ranked interventions are diametrically opposed to this axis (CONT6b, CONT6a, and CONT8). In Figure 2, all eight stakeholders point toward the right of the x axis, meaning that there are no major discordances in their preferences. Stakeholder 6 and stakeholder 8 are located somewhat apart from the rest of the group’s preferences and had the most different preferences and individual rankings. When examining their individual rankings and intervention scores (Table 6), their top three ranked interventions differ slightly from those of the group ranking even though the top three ranked group interventions are among stakeholder 6 and 8’s four highest ranked interventions (S8 even shares the same top three interventions as the group, but in a different order). This information can be used to help identify the stakeholders with distinct positions relative to the rest of the group, and represents a transparent articulation of decision considerations that need to be further discussed to reach a better consensus.\", \"Intervention profiles graphically represent the relative intrinsic performance of an intervention on each criterion, independently of stakeholder expressed preferences (weighting schemes) (Figure 3). A descriptive analysis of the intervention profiles allows for a better understanding of the trade-off to be considered in the overall decision and to identify complementary interventions. The Y axis represents the score of the intervention for each criterion. The first ranked intervention of the group, CONT0 (status quo - basic preventive communications) performs well on animal and environmental health criteria and most operational criteria, but performs poorly on the first two Public health criteria, PHC1 (reduction of human case incidence) and PHC2 (reduction of entomological risk). Conversely, the third ranked intervention, CONT3a (small scale landscaping), performs poorly on the AEC1 criterion (impact on habitat) and SIC2 criterion (proportion of the population benefiting from the intervention), but performs more efficiently on the PHC1 and PHC2 criteria. A score of 1 on a criterion (e.g. Criteria SEC4 (Complexity) and SEC5 (Impact on organisation’s credibility) for CONT0) means that the intervention has the best intrinsic performance for this criterion among all interventions. By examining an intervention’s profile, stakeholders can consider various portfolios of interventions in order to create balanced control programmes capable of addressing multiple objectives.\", \"A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of a stakeholder’s weighting preferences on their individual and group rankings. This analysis gives indications of the robustness of the results. Stability intervals can be generated for each stakeholder for all criteria. For example, as shown in Table 7, stakeholder 8 can change the weight given to the SEC2 criteria (cost for the private sector) from 0 to 100% without this change affecting the nature of the stakeholder’s top three ranked interventions. However, any variations in the weight of the “PHC1-Reduction in human cases incidence” criterion beyond the range of 27.5 to 38.2 will result in a change in nature of the top ranked interventions for stakeholder 3 indicating that the results are more sensitive to this later criterion.\", \"This study demonstrated the application of a transparent decision analysis method to identify decision criteria and rank interventions for the control of Lyme disease in Quebec as an illustration of its potential for the planning and management of other complex public health issues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of MCDA models to document stakeholder engagement in the prioritization of Lyme disease management interventions, and the first use of such an approach to analyse public health interventions for an emerging zoonosis tackling surveillance and control interventions in a comprehensive manner. One of the key observations resulting from this study pertains to the list of criteria identified for use in the different fields of interventions relating to Lyme disease management. The general criteria categories demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the models and lend support to the use of MCDA methods as concrete applications of a “One Health” approach to zoonoses management. The list of criteria could likely be generalized or adapted for use with other vector-borne and zoonotic disease management problems. As an example, four of the general categories (public health, animal and environmental health, social impacts and strategic, economic and operational impacts) and several criteria identified with a different group of stakeholders for two other MCDA models developed to address communication strategies for Lyme disease in Quebec by the research team were identical to those identified for SURV and CONT models (MCDA-Lyme Consortium, 2012, data not shown). Furthermore, the criteria identified in this study correspond directly to the dimensions which should be integrated when analysing public policies, as identified and recommended by the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy. This centre recently published a method for synthesizing knowledge about public policies, integrating six dimensions [43], which can be directly correlated to our list of criteria as shown in Table 8. This observation reinforces the fact that MCDA methods have the potential to improve public health decisions in line with the most recent national recommendations for evaluating public policies.\", \"The observed variations in stakeholder’s weighting of criteria was expected and can be explained as a result of differences in values, perspectives, objectives and expertise of the participating stakeholders, which is desirable within a interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach. On the other hand, changing the scenario from “emergence” to “epidemic” was found to have little effect on the results, which was unexpected for the research team. Although some additional weighting was given to the public health criteria by several stakeholders during the epidemic scenario, the changes were not sufficient to produce clear differences in the overall rankings of interventions between scenarios. More weight for public health criteria and social acceptability criteria during the epidemic scenario were expected but not clearly observed in this study. One hypothesis is that the description given of the epidemic scenario was not sufficiently alarming to prompt important differences in stakeholder weighting schemes between scenarios. Further analyses are needed under real epidemic situations to validate these observations and to correlate the findings of the MCDA analysis with actions that would actually be implemented by stakeholders in such situations.\", \"In both models, performance evaluations of interventions used qualitative categorical indicators for every criterion. If ordinal scales were better suited for the evaluation of certain criteria, as was the case for the SEC4 (complexity) criterion, numeric scales were used to incorporate more precision for other criteria, such as PHC1 (reduction in human case incidence), SEC1 and SEC2 (costs for the public and the private sectors). Moreover, experts who contributed to the evaluation of certain parameters were also stakeholders on the MCDA process for the CONT model. If this approach can be interesting for the appropriation of the decision-making process by the stakeholders, it could also introduce bias in the evaluation of parameters, as preferences and expertise can vary among them. This reflected the data quality which was available at the time of the study and is the main limit of this study. Lyme disease is emerging in Quebec, and very few field studies have been performed to date. The data quality evaluation performed in the models was useful for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge on public health intervention efficacy and impacts in the Quebec context. For the vast majority of interventions and criteria, expert opinions were the most effective way to obtain the data required to complete the models. More time and resources could be used to counter this weakness: field studies can be realized with the objective of increasing the precision of performance evaluations in models. For example, to assess the social acceptability of different control interventions, a Delphi survey was conducted among the stakeholders. A more representative survey conducted among the target population could increase the precision of this performance measure. Furthermore, additional analysis using the same MCDA model structure in other geographical areas where Lyme disease epidemiology is better characterised would provide an opportunity to validate the present model.\", \"The first position occupied by CONT0 (status quo-basic preventive communications) in the group ranking for the CONT model was expected. The current communication method in place involves the diffusion of general information via the public organisation’s web interface. This intervention is a baseline intervention upon which stakeholders should build (but not eliminate) and include additional interventions to improve Lyme management.\", \"For the SURV model, the top two ranked interventions were SURV2a (active surveillance of I. scapularis by flagging or dragging) and SURV2b (active surveillance of I. scapularis by trapping of small rodents). Again, this was expected, because these two interventions are considered the gold standard approach for Lyme vector surveillance in Canada at the moment [31]. The rank order of other SURV interventions should be interpreted relative to these gold standards in the group ranking.\", \"Despite small differences, the decision map for the CONT model showed a good level of agreement between stakeholders. SURV model revealed similar observations. Even if these results represent only the views of a small group of stakeholders, greater differences could have been expected. For example, from stakeholders working for public environmental organisations, one could have expected stronger preferences for low environmental impact interventions, when compared to public health professionals. This observation demonstrates that public health protection is still a strong commonly held value, despite expertise and sectoral differences between stakeholders. In this study, there were no representatives from the general public or from public interest groups. This was a methodological choice made after discussion with participating stakeholders and in light of the exploratory nature of the objectives. The inclusion of such groups, either as representatives of the general public or of representatives of select interest groups (for example members of the Canadian Lyme disease foundation, CanLyme, or public park users) could help diversify the range of expressed preferences and concerns, an important dimension that should be considered in public health decision making.\", \"Analysis of the intervention profiles allowed identification of complementary interventions for all models. The strengths and weaknesses of an intervention can be easily identified with these types of analyses, and highlights the need to include diverse interventions for an efficient prevention programme capable of responding to multiple objectives.\", \"Sensitivity analyses conducted were limited to identifying stability intervals for weights given to criteria by each stakeholder. Other types of variation, for example on performance parameters of interventions, have to be simulated manually by changing parameters in the matrix. This was not realised in a systematic manner for this study but would be an interesting further step, particularly on parameters which are not supported by the scientific literature. This could help to identify which would be the more urgent knowledge gaps to tackle to consolidate decision-making in this context. Except for sensitivity analysis, the evaluation of a MCDA model’s validity is rarely mentioned in the scientific literature [44]. A framework for MCDA model validity testing would be of great use for public health research. This framework could include more extensive sensitivity analysis on weights and parameters, as well as a standardised approach to assess how accurately the model captures issues of importance to decision-makers.\", \"Building on this study’s experience, the authors believe that MCDA approaches offer a structured and systematic process for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge relating to important decision issues, and can be of great use to guide research priorities in public health in a context of finite and sometimes scarce resources. Another major advantage of formal decision analysis methods is the long-term utility it can confer to decision-makers. Once the matrix is completed (i.e. criteria, interventions and performances have been identified), stakeholders can re-evaluate their weights on each criteria as the epidemiological situation of the disease changes, and can observe the impacts on intervention prioritization. Used in this manner, MCDA models could be adapted and potentially used with real-time decision-making methods.\", \"Some challenges arose during the study. First, depending on the scope and depth of the analysis, the MCDA process can be time-consuming: given the participatory approach used in this study, a significant time commitment was needed for meetings and discussions. Experts recommend a minimum of six months to complete an MCDA process with participative components. However, in this case, two years were needed to put together the research team and complete the study. Public health experts had no experience with MCDA methods, and the learning process demanded time and resources. This is not surprising and prolonged timelines have been observed in other multidisciplinary teams [7]. As such, MCDA approaches may be best suited for strategic public health planning rather than for daily decisions and emergency situations, unless MCDA models are already developed. Creating weighting schemes was also challenging and not intuitive for the majority of stakeholders. Individual support was needed in several cases, and participants needed a good understanding of the MCDA process to perform the weighting. Methods exist to facilitate the weighting process in MCDA approaches, such as the use of card sets to help order criteria before attributing numerical values [45]. We strongly recommend using them to increase the validity of analysis.\", \"The participative approach used in identifying key stakeholders, criteria and potential interventions contributed to building a comprehensive structure of the key issues in need of consideration and helped capture the complexity of the health problem. The use of a participatory approach in this study also had an interesting and important consequence: the learning process put stakeholders from different sectors and organisations together and enabled mutual learning about each other’s organisation’s issues and priorities. During this project, stakeholders met between two to five times within the year to complete the process. We believe that this approach reinforces an interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach to public health management, leading to institutional empowerment. These long-term outcomes were previously observed in several examples of participatory approaches in health research [46].\", \"This study presented the results of an MCDA approach for the management of a complex public health issue - an emerging zoonosis - using a study of Lyme disease management in Quebec, Canada. Results showed that despite different weighting schemes among stakeholders, both models revealed a good level of agreement with regards to preferred interventions for surveillance and control of Lyme disease. The reliance primarily on expert opinion for development of the performance matrices underscores the need to enhance scientific knowledge on issues of importance for decision-making for Lyme management in Quebec. Overall, explicit decision analysis methods present themselves as an interesting systematic approach for the management of complex public health issues and particularly for emerging infectious diseases arising from human populations interacting with animals and the environment. Future steps should include an assessment of the applicability and usefulness of the proposed models for program-level decision support pertinent to the prevention and control of Lyme disease in Canada. Moreover, building on the outcome of this project, future projects should evaluate the utility of MCDA for structuring a formal decision analysis approach for other complex public health issues (e.g.: prevention of foodborne and waterborne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, influenza, and environmental health issues) as well as within various ongoing processes and prioritization settings targeting effective multi-sectoral engagement. The development of a methodological framework for MCDA model validation would also be of great interest for the public health sector.\", \"AEC: Animal and environmental health criteria; COMM: Communication model; CONT: Control model/Control interventions; SOC: Strategic, economic and operational criteria; HSSA: Health and Social Services Agency; MCDA: Multi-criteria decision analysis; PHC: Public health criteria; SIC: Social impact criteria; SUC: Surveillance criteria; SURV: Surveillance model/Surveillance interventions.\", \"The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\", \"JPW, DB and PM directed the study.

produced by B cells and specifically target antigens. The hybridoma technique introduced by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 [1] has made it possible to obtain pure mAbs in large amounts, greatly enhancing the basic research and potential for their clinical use. Other scientific and technological advances have also enabled the successful translation of mAbs to the clinic. Around the world, at least 570 therapeutic mAbs have been studied in clinical trials by commercial companies [2], and 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and are currently on the market [3], including 30 mAbs for the treatment of cancer (Table 1).\\n\", \"The increasing importance of therapeutic mAbs is apparent (Fig. 1), as mAbs have become the predominant treatment modality for various diseases over the past 25 years. During this time, major technological advances have made the discovery and development of mAb therapies quicker and more efficient. Since 2008, 48 new mAbs have been approved, contributing to a total global market of 61 mAbs in clinical use at the end of 2017, according to the US FDA. Strikingly, a total of 18 new antibodies were granted approval by the US FDA from 2018 to 2019 – this number was tallied from information contained on various websites, including the antibody society [3], the database of therapeutic antibodies [4], and company pipelines and press releases. A list of antibody-based drugs approved by the US FDA is shown in Table 1.\\n\", \"The first therapeutic mAb, muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3), was approved by the US FDA in 1986 [5] and comprises a murine mAb against T cell-expressed CD3 that functions as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of acute transplant rejection. The marketing end date of muromonab-CD3 is on July 30th, 2011 (Table 1). To overcome problems of decreased immunogenic potential and efficacy, while making possible the therapeutic use of antibodies for an extended duration, researchers developed techniques to transform rodent antibodies into structures more similar to human antibodies, without loss of binding properties. The first chimeric antibody, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antigen-binding fragment (Fab) (abciximab), was approved in 1994 by the US FDA for inhibition of platelet aggregation in cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 1). The drug was developed by combining sequences of the murine variable domain with human constant region domain (Fig. 2b) [6, 7]. Then the first mAb with an oncologic indication, rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 approved for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1997 by US FDA (Fig. 1) [8, 9].\\n\", \"One exceptional advance that accelerated the approval of therapeutic mAbs was the generation of humanized antibodies by the complementary-determining region (CDR) grafting technique [10]. In CDR grafting, non-human antibody CDR sequences are transplanted into a human framework sequence in order to maintain target specificity [10] (Fig. 2c). The first humanized mAb approved by the US FDA in 1997 was the anti-IL-2 receptor, daclizumab, for the prevention of transplant rejection (Fig. 1) [11]. The humanization of antibodies made it possible to clinically apply a new class of biologics directed against diseases that require long-term treatment, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases [12].\", \"Based on the success of humanized mAbs in the clinic, a key discovery technology to obtain fully human mAbs (Fig. 2d) was developed in 1990 by Sir Gregory P. Winter [10, 13]. This technique was based on phage display, wherein diverse exogenous genes are incorporated into filamentous bacteriophages to compose a library. The library proteins are then presented on the phage surface as fusions with a phage coat protein, allowing the selection of specific binders and affinity characteristics. The phage display technique was first introduced by George P. Smith [14] and comprises a powerful method for the rapid identification of peptides or antibody fragments, such as single chain fragment variable (scFv) or Fab, that bind a variety of target molecules (proteins, cell-surface glycans and receptors) [15] (Fig. 3b). The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter. George Smith developed phage-displayed peptides, which can be used to evolve new proteins [14]. Gregory P. Winter was able to apply the phage-displayed antibody library to the discovery and isolation of antibodies [13]. Phage display technology has also been used for antibody maturation by site-directed mutagenesis of CDR and affinity selection. Based on these techniques, the first fully human therapeutic antibody, adalimumab (Humira), an anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) human antibody [16], was approved in 2002 by the US FDA for rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 1). Until now, nine human antibody drugs generated by phage display have been approved by the US FDA (Table 5).\\n\", \"Transgenic animals represent another technology for obtaining fully human mAbs (Fig. 3c). This technology was introduced in 1994 by the publication of two transgenic mouse lines, the HuMabMouse [35] and the XenoMouse [36]. The lines were genetically modified such that human immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were inserted into the genome, replacing the endogenous Ig genes and making these animals capable of synthesizing fully human antibodies upon immunization [35, 37]. The first human antibody generated in a transgenic mouse to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), panitumumab, was approved by the US FDA in 2006 (Fig. 1) [38, 39]. The number of fully human antibodies made from transgenic mice has increased rapidly, with the number of approved drugs currently at 19 (Table 5). Depending on the immunization protocol, high-affinity human antibodies can be obtained through further selection of hybridoma clones generated from immunized transgenic mice. Using a theoretically similar approach, the generation of neutralizing human antibodies from human B cells has also yielded promising results for infectious disease therapeutics.\", \"The recent development of bispecific antibodies offers attractive new opportunities for the design of novel protein therapeutics. A bispecific antibody can be generated by utilizing protein engineering techniques to link two antigen binding domains (such as Fabs or scFvs), allowing a single antibody to simultaneously bind different antigens. Thus, bispecific antibodies may be engineered to exhibit novel functions, which do not exist in mixtures of the two parental antibodies. Most bispecific antibodies are designed to recruit cytotoxic effector cells of the immune system to target pathogenic cells [40]. The first approved bispecific antibody was catumaxomab in Europe in 2009 [41]. Catumaxomab targets CD3 and EpCAM to treat solid tumors in patients with malignant ascites. However, this drug was withdrawn from the market in 2017 for commercial reasons. Currently, two bispecific antibodies have obtained US FDA approval and are on the market. First, blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that targets CD3 and CD19 for treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [42]. Second, emicizumab is a full-size bispecific IgG with natural architecture, which binds to activated coagulation factors IX and X for the treatment of haemophilia A [43]. To date, there are more than 85 bispecific antibodies in clinical trials, about 86% of which are under evaluation as cancer therapies [40]. The concepts and platforms driving the development of bispecific antibodies continue to advance rapidly, creating many new opportunities to make major therapeutic breakthroughs.\", \"While mAbs are routinely used in biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, and medical research, perhaps the most beneficial application is their use as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of human diseases, such as cancer, asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, transplant rejection, migraine headaches and infectious diseases (Table 1). Important advances in antibody engineering made over the past decade have enhanced the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic antibodies. These developments, along with a greater understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of antibodies, have paved the way for the next generation of new and improved antibody-based drugs for the treatment of human diseases.\", \"The mAb market enjoys a healthy pipeline and is expected to grow at an increasing pace, with a current valuation of $115.2 billion in 2018 [44]. Despite this high growth potential, new companies are unlikely to take over large shares of the market, which is currently dominated by seven companies: Genentech (30.8%), Abbvie (20.0%), Johnson & Johnson (13.6%), Bristol-Myers Squibb (6.5%), Merck Sharp & Dohme (5.6%), Novartis (5.5%), Amgen (4.9%), with other companies comprising the remaining 13% [44].\", \"Many mAbs products achieved annual sales of over US$3 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1), while six (adalimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab) had sales of more than $6 billion (Table 2). Adalimumab (Humira) had the highest sales figure ever recorded for a biopharmaceutical product, nearly $19.9 billion. The top ten selling mAb products in 2018 are listed in Table 2. Top-selling mAb drugs were ranked based on sales or revenue reported by biological or pharmacological companies in press announcements, conference calls, annual reports or investor materials throughout 2018. For each drug, the name, sponsors, disease indications, and 2018 sales are shown.\\n\", \"mAbs are increasingly used for a broad range of targets; oncology, immunology, and hematology remain the most prevalent medical applications [45]. Most mAbs have multiple disease indications and at least one that is cancer-related (lymphoma, myeloma, melanoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck cancers). As such, oncological diseases are the medical specialty most accessible to mAb treatments [45]. Moreover, the number of target proteins known to function as either stimulatory or inhibitory checkpoints of the immune system has dramatically expanded, and numerous antibody therapeutics targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, cemiplimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, durvalumab, avelumab, atezolizumab) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, ipilimumab) have been granted marketing approvals [46].\", \"Adalimumab (Humira) was the world’s best-selling drug in 2018. Adalimumab is a subcutaneously administered biological disease modifier used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other TNFα-mediated chronic debilitating diseases. It was originally launched by Abbvie in the United States after gaining approval from the US FDA in 2002. It has been shown that Adalimumab reduces the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults, and it is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [47, 48]. It may be used alone or in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [49].\", \"Immune checkpoints are important for maintaining self-tolerance and tempering physiologic immune responses in peripheral tissues. Therefore, the molecules underlying checkpoints have recently drawn considerable interest in cancer immunotherapy [50]. Both nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are anti-PD-1 mAbs and were the second and third best-selling mAb drugs in 2018 (Table 2). Nivolumab is a human antibody, which blocks a signal that normally prevents activated T cells from attacking cancer cells. The target for nivolumab is the PD-1 receptor, and the antibody blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated immune inhibition [51, 52]. Pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy to treat melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and stomach cancer [53–55]. Pembrolizumab is a first-line treatment for NSCLC if cancer cells overexpresse PD-L1 and have no mutations in EGFR or in anaplastic lymphoma kinase [56, 57]. Large randomized clinical trials indicated that NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab and pembrolizumab (both approved by the US FDA in 2014) showed increased overall survival compared with docetaxel, the standard second-line treatment [58].\", \"A total of 12 new mAbs were approved in the US during 2018. The majority of these products were approved for non-cancer indications, perhaps reflecting the higher approval success rate for antibodies as treatments for other diseases. Three antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremaezumab) were approved for migraine prevention, and one (Ibalizumab) is used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The three migraine-preventing drugs, Erenumab (Aimovig), galcanezumab (Emgality), and fremaezumab (Ajovy), are mAbs that block the activity of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor in migraine etiology [59]. CGRP acts through a heteromeric receptor, which is composed of a G protein-coupled receptor(calcitonin receptor-like receptor: CALCRL) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) [60, 61]. Both galcanezumab and fremaezumab bind to CGRP and block its binding to the receptor. However, erenumab is the only one of the three antibodies to target the extracellular domains of human G protein-coupled receptors CALCRL and RAMP1,interfering with the CGRP binding pocket [62].\", \"Many mAbs are under development for treatment of infectious diseases, currently only four have been approved by the US FDA: raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab for treatment of inhalational anthrax [63], palivizumab for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in high-risk infants [64], and ibalizumab for treatment of HIV infection patients [65]. Ibalizumab (Trogarzo) is a humanized IgG4 mAb that is used as a CD4 domain 2-directed post-attachment HIV-1 inhibitor. The US FDA approved ibalizumab for adult patients infected with HIV who were previously treated and are resistant to currently available therapies.\", \"Companies are currently sponsoring clinical studies for more than 570 mAbs. Of these, approximately 90% are early-stage studies designed to assess safety (Phase I) or safety and preliminary efficacy (Phase I/II or Phase II) in patient populations. Most of the mAbs in Phase I (~ 70%) are for cancer treatment, and the proportions of mAbs intended to treat cancer are similar for those currently in Phase II and late-stage clinical studies (pivotal Phase II, Phase II/III or Phase III) [2].\", \"Twenty-nine novel antibody therapeutics were in late-stage clinical studies for non-cancer indications in 2018. Among the trials for these mAbs, no single therapeutic area predominated, but 40% were for immune-mediated disorders, which comprised the largest group. From this group of potential treatments, leronlimab and brolucizumab entered regulatory review by the end of 2018, and five mAbs (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, crizanlizumab, satralizumab, and tanezumab) may enter regulatory review in 2019. In comparison, there were 33 novel antibody therapeutics in late-stage clinical studies for cancer indications in 2018. Antibody therapeutics for solid tumors clearly predominated, with less than 20% of the candidates intended solely for hematological malignancies. Five mAbs (isatuximab, spartalizumab, tafasitamab, dostarlimab, and ublituximab) license applications were submitted to the US FDA in 2019 [2].\", \"Isatuximab is an anti-CD38 IgG1 chimeric mAb under evaluation as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Combinations of isatuximab and different chemotherapies are being tested in three Phase III studies (ICARIA, IKEMA, and IMROZ) on MM patients. The ICARIA study (NCT02990338) is evaluating the effects of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone compared to chemotherapy only in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. Pivotal Phase III ICARIA-MM trial results demonstrated that isatuximab combination therapy showed statistically significant improvements compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory MM in 2019. The US FDA has accepted for review the biologics license application for isatuximab for the treatment relapsed or refractory MM patients. The target action date for the FDA decision is April 2020 [66]. The IKEMA (NCT03275285) and IMROZ (NCT03319667) studies are evaluating the isatuximab with other chemotherapeautic combinations in MM patients [67].\", \"Spartalizumab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds PD-1 with sub-nanomolar affinity and blocks its interaction with PD-L1/PD-L2, preventing PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling and leading to T-cell activation. Clinical study of Spartalizumab is underway with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III COMBI-i study (NCT02967692), which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination with spartalizumab compared to matching placebo in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The primary endpoints of the study are an assessment of dose-limiting toxicities, changes in PD-L1 levels and CD8+ cells in the tumor microenvironment, and progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints are overall survival, overall response rate and duration of response. The estimated primary completion date of the study is September 2019 [68].\", \"Dostarlimab is an anti-PD-1 mAb that may be useful as a treatment for several types of cancers. GlaxoSmithKline announced results from a Phase I dose escalation and cohort expansion study (GARNET; NCT02715284) in 2018, which is expected to support a biologics license application submission to the US FDA in 2019. Dostarlimab is being assessed in patients with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options in the GARNET study. The drug is administered at a dose of 500 mg every 3 weeks for the first 4 cycles, and 1000 mg every 6 weeks thereafter in four patient cohorts: microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer, MSI-H non-endometrial cancer, microsatellite-stable endometrial cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Dostarlimab is also being evaluated in another Phase III study (NCT03602859), which is comparing platinum-based therapy with dostarlimab and niraparib versus standard of care platinum-based therapy as first-line treatment of Stage III or IV non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer [69].\", \"Ublituximab is a glyco-engineered anti-CD20 antibody currently under clinical investigation in five late-stage clinical studies for different cancers (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and non-cancer (multiple sclerosis) indications. Three Phase III studies are exploring the efficacy of ublituximab in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Among these studies, the UNITY-CLL Phase III study (NCT02612311) is evaluating the combination of ublituximab and TGR-1202, a PI3K delta inhibitor, compared to anti-CD20 obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in untreated and previously treated CLL patients. Two other Phase III studies (ULTIMATE 1, NCT03277261 and ULTIMATE 2, NCT03277248) are evaluating the efficacy and safety of ublituximab compared to teriflunomide in 440 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis [70].\", \"Humanized mAbs, of which only the CDRs of the light and heavy chains are murine, entered clinical development for the first time in 1988 [71, 72]. CDR grafting is one of the most popular techniques in the production of humanized mAbs and was originally developed by Gregory P. Winter in 1986 [9]. Using this technology, non-human CDR sequences are transplanted into human framework sequences, allowing the antibody to maintain the binding activity to the target antigen [9]. The first US FDA approved CDR-grafted humanized mAb occurred in 1997 for daclizumab, which binds the IL-2 receptor and is used to prevent transplant rejection [11]. Queen and collaborators [73] developed daclizumab not only using CDR grafting, but also using the human framework that is maximally homologous to the murine framework, in order to decrease the loss of antigen recognition. In some cases, certain amino acids in the murine framework are crucial to maintain antibody binding activity. These residues may cooperate with CDRs to present an antibody paratope or directly interact with antigens. Currently, these crucial framework residues can be identified by observing the structure of antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and computer-aided protein homology modelling [74]. The positions of amino acids in the framework may then be considered for restore by ‘human back to mouse’ mutations in CDR-grafted humanized antibodies, thereby improving the affinity and stability of the final product. Currently, web servers are being developed by integrated bioinformatics and antibody structure databases for rendering humanization experiments [75, 76]. They provide the tools for human template selection, grafting, back-mutation evaluation, and antibody modeling. However, if the binding activity of antibodies is still compromised, it should be further performed affinity maturation to improve this situation.\", \"Multiple methods have been developed to quantify the humanness of the variable region of mAbs. Abhinandan and Martin designed a tool called “H-score” to assess the “degree of humanness” of antibody sequences, which calculates the mean sequence identity compared to a subset of human variable region sequences database [77]. A germinality index was defined subsequent to assist germline humanization of a macaque antibody [78]. G-score was derived from the H-score to improve classification of germline framework sequence [79]. T20 score analyzer was established under a large database of ~ 38,700 human antibody variable region sequences to clearly separate human sequences from mouse sequences and many other species as well [80]. It was used to reveal similarities between humanized antibodies and fully human antibodies. These humanness score tools are available online and allow assisting the generation of humanized antibody [80].\", \"The use of humanized antibodies has helped greatly to improve clinical tolerance of mAb therapeutics. Such intricate control over antibody sequences has opened the door to engineering mAbs for a wide range of possible applications in medicine. Currently, half of all mAbs used to treat humans are chimeric or humanized (Fig. 2, Table 1). One of the most well-known humanized antibodies is Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which was approved in 1998 and achieved annual sales of over $7 billion in 2018 (Table 2). Trastuzumab is used for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [57, 58].\", \"The use of mAbs in a clinical setting should have several essential biophysical properties, including high antigen binding activity, high stability, and low immunogenicity [81]. Antibody immunogenicity means the degree of the host immune system can recognize and react to these therapeutic agents. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) induced by the immune system can be found while immunogenicity occurring in patients administered with antibody drugs. Anti-drug antibodies have the potential to neutralize therapeutic agents, which can reduce the efficacy of the drugs [82]. Importantly, anti-drug antibodies may further cause adverse effects ranging from skin rashes to systemic inflammatory responses in the patients, which can impact both safety and efficacy of the antibody drugs in clinic use [83]. Immunogenicity is influenced by several factors, such as drug dosage, administration strategy (route and combination), impurities contamination, aggregates arising from Ab/Ag binding complex, and structural features (sequence variation and glycosylation) [84].\", \"Humanized antibodies harbor human sequence in constant regions and nearly all human sequence in Fv, of which only CDRs are murine grafted. Antibodies of more human-like usually allow them to be higher tolerant and lower immunogenic in a clinical setting. For example, Perpetua et al. showed a case to support this concept [85]. They compared a humanized anti-CD52 antibody with its parental murine version and demonstrated humanization offers a significant reduction in immunogenicity. However, humanized antibodies retain murine CDRs which could be regarded as foreign antigens by host immune systems and eventually arise immunogenicity. For example, ADA was detected in 0.5% of women with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated with Trastuzumab during their therapeutic courses [86]. Recently, an immunogenicity analysis result from clinical data showed the ADA rates were 7.1% (21/296) in the HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with treatment of Trastuzumab [87]. The variation of immunogenicity in the same antibody drug may be caused by many potential factors: the age, race, genetic background, other related diseases, and programs of drugs administration.\", \"The CDRs and frameworks of fully human antibodies are derived for human immunoglobulin gene repertoires, thus which can theoretically bypass immunogenicity. However, several fully human antibodies have been reported to induce marked immune responses when administrated in patients [88]. Adalimumab (Humira), a human IgG1, has been reported to generate significant immune responses through eliciting anti-idiotypic antibody in a part of patients (5–89%) which varies depending on the disease and the therapy [89, 90]. Golimumab (Simponi), a fully human anti-TNFα antibody, combining with methotrexate for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis cause 16% of patients producing anti-drug antibodies [91]. One reason of these scenarios is that Fv sequence of human antibodies is not identical to human germline: antibody evolution through VJ and VDJ random recombination, as well as affinity maturation naturally occurring in vivo through somatic hypermutation. Until now, there are no in vitro or in-silico assays can precisely analyze the immunogenicity of antibody. In vivo assessments are usually used to evaluate the immunogenicity, of which the result will ameliorate design and engineering of antibody therapeutics to reduce the potential for inducing anti-drug antibodies.\", \"Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [14], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created “antibody-selectable phage vectors” and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phage-displayed antibodies from 108-fold excess phage pools [92]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [13, 93, 94], the German Cancer Research Center in Germany [95], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [96]. Since then, these phage-displayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [97].\", \"The process of identifying mAbs from a phage-displayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 4a). The variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different VH and VL chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [98, 99]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 4b); scFvs are composed of the VH and VL domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100, 101]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (1013 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 1011 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [102–104].\\n\", \"Gene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from naïve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display naïve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the naïve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a naïve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large naïve [94, 104, 105] and synthetic [102, 106, 107] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore, such non-immunized libraries have the distinct advantages of avoiding issues with immunological tolerance in immunized mice, and they do not require new immunized libraries for each new target.\", \"Currently, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on highly diverse non-immunized gene repertoires, which allow selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of targets [108]. It is worth noting that most antibody drugs that have undergone evaluation in clinical trials originated from a few company-owned libraries. These libraries include: Cambridge Antibody Technology’s (now MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca) scFv-fragment library, Dyax Corp’s (now Shire) human Fab-fragment libraries, scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA, and the fully synthetic human combinatorial antibody scFv (HuCAL) and Fab (HuCALGold) libraries developed by MorphoSys [97].\", \"Antibody libraries are typically screened by iterative selection cycles to enrich target-binding phages, followed by amplification of the bound phages in E. coli cells. The affinity screening process for antibody libraries is called biopanning (Fig. 4c). Repeated rounds of selection allow for the enrichment of very rare antigen-binding phage clones, eventually resulting in the selection of the most highly specific binders. This stringent process is a critical feature of phage display that allows mAbs to be isolated in a period as short as a couple of weeks, far more quickly than the traditional hybridoma method [99, 109]. For in vitro selection, it is necessary to immobilize target antigens on a solid surface. Polystyrene surfaces with high protein binding capacity, such as 96-well immuno-plates and immuno-tubes, are widely used for antigen immobilization. Additionally, magnetic beads with protein G/A, streptavidin, maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide can be used to immobilize antigens and perform biopanning in solution.\", \"The biopanning method is not only restricted to known recombinant proteins. In fact, the phage display technique may also be utilized to select antibodies against whole cells, unveiling previously unknown antigens on the tumor cell surface [110]. Cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and only a few tumor cells with stem-like properties are able to initiate and sustain tumor development; these cells are often referred as tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) [111]. Phage display technology is well suited for applications in CSC research, and several antibodies have already been identified from phage display libraries for their ability to bind known CSC markers, such as CD133 and CD44 [112, 113]. Moreover, novel CSC surface markers may be identified by selecting phage-displayed antibodies that bind to a CSC-like population and then identifying the corresponding target antigens [114, 115]. The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [116–118] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [119].\", \"Antibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery “missiles” for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [120]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [121]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [99, 122]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37 °C [123]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [99, 124].\", \"The identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [125–127]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [128]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogen-infected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [129]. Such a library can allow for the rapid identification of high-affinity antibodies that may then be used as guides for vaccine design, or to develop therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents.\", \"Moreover, the biopanning approach has been modified to isolate and identify a few antibodies with broad neutralizing activity against pandemic influenza virus [130, 131]. Chen et al. reported the establishment of a phage-displayed Fab library derived from the PBMCs of convalescent patients infected with a novel influenza A virus H7N9, which broke out in 2013. Using this library, antibodies targeting purified H7N9 virions were isolated [132]. Two human antibodies were found to exhibit high neutralizing activity against live H7N9 virus due to their interactions with the receptor-binding site of viral hemagglutinin antigens [132, 133].\", \"The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like disease with an approximately 43% mortality rate [134]. To date, no vaccines or antiviral medications are available for the prevention or clinical treatment of MERS. A large phage-displayed human naive scFv library (Mehta I/II) with 2.7 × 1010 clones from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was used as a resource for the isolation of human antibodies against MERS-CoV [135]. In another project, a research group in Malaysia improved panning strategies with a naïve human scFv library (library size of 109) to successfully identify mAbs specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein [136].\", \"Studies such as those described offer insights into the human antibody response to viral pathogen infection and provide examples of how the outbreak scene may be utilized to develop human antibody-based immunotherapies for the prevention and early treatment of viral pathogens [137].\", \"Fully human therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use were discovered from either phage display or transgenic mice approaches [138]. Phage display has the advantage of allowing researchers to tailor critical characteristics of successful antibody drugs (e.g., affinity, specificity, cross-reactivity and stability). There are nine phage display-derived human antibodies currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of human disease (Table 1), demonstrating the reliability of this technique as a platform for antibody discovery.\", \"Adalimumab (Humira) was developed by BASF Bioresearch Corporation and Cambridge Antibody Technology. It was not only the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval, but adalimubab was also the first approved (2002) fully human mAb drug [139]. Adalimumab binds and suppresses TNFα and is approved to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis. Adalimumab is the world’s best-selling drug [140] with sales of $19.9 billion in 2018 reported by AbbVie (Table 2). Cambridge Antibody Technology also identified human antibodies targeting BLYS (B lymphocyte stimulator) from phage display [141]. BLYS, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of cytokines, induces B cell proliferation and differentiation that positively correlate with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This anti-BLYS antibody was named belimumab and marketed as Benlysta by GlaxoSmithKline, becoming the first drug approved (2011) for the treatment of SLE [142]. Founded in 1989, Cambridge Antibody Technology was acquired by AstraZeneca for $1.32 billion in 2006 [143].\", \"Tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, with higher expression and activation in tumors than in normal tissues. These characteristics make the receptors potentially valuable targets for drug development. Necitumumab (Portrazza) is an anti-EGFR human antibody that was identified by screening high EGFR-expressing epidermal carcinoma cells (A431) with a non-immunized phage Fab library of 3.7 × 1010 clones [105]. Necitumumab was approved in 2015 and is now a first-line therapy in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of squamous NSCLC [144]. VEGFR2 is not only highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells, where it regulates tumor angiogenesis, but it also expressed on the surface of cancer cells. The anti-VEGFR2 human antibody, ramucirumab (Cyramza), was approved for the treatment of gastric cancer, metastatic NSCLC and metastatic colorectal cancer [145, 146]. The development of ramucirumab was initiated by using a phage-displayed human naïve Fab library (Dyax) containing 3.7 × 1010 independent clones for biopanning against the extracellular domain of human VEGFR2 protein [105]. Three Fab clones, D2C6, D2H2, and D1H4, were selected based on their specific binding to VEGFR2 with nanomolar affinity and their ability to neutralize VEGF-A-activated VEGFR2 signaling. Interestingly, these three Fab clones do not cross-react with murine VEGFR2 and share an identical VH sequence [147]. After affinity maturation with stringent biopanning rounds, Fab clone 1121 (IMC-1121B) was selected and showed more than the 30-fold improvement of VEGFR2-binding activity. This clone was subsequently engineered into the human intact IgG1 version (ramucirumab), which has an affinity of 50 pM [148].\", \"PD-L1, a cell-surface protein, binds to its receptor PD-1 on immune cells, downregulating T cell inflammatory activity to promote self-tolerance by the immune system. Many types of tumors have been found to express PD-L1 on the surface of cancer cells, using the immune-suppressing action to evade immune attacks. Avelumab (Bavencio) is fully human IgG1 lamda antibody against PD-L1, which was derived from a phage-displayed naïve Fab library (Dyax) [149]. Avelumab not only blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1, but it also induces ADCC in cancers [150]. The later function differs from other immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies. The US FDA approved avelumab in 2017 for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma and Merkel-cell carcinoma, an aggressive type of skin cancer [151].\", \"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes skin cell overproduction and is characterized by raised, inflamed, red lesions and plaques that are accompanied by physical pain and itching. Guselkumab (Tremfya) is a fully human antibody developed by Janssen that neutralizes anti-IL-23. The HuCAL antibody library was used to generate guselkumab under a license from MorphoSys [152, 153]. In 2017, guselkumab was granted marketing approval by the US FDA for the treatment of plaque psoriasis [154].\", \"Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease that results in spontaneous, recurrent, and potentially life-threatening attacks of swelling in various parts of the body [155]. The disease is commonly associated with deficiency or dysfunction of C1-esterase-inhibitor and with excessive bradykinin production caused by overactive plasma kallikrein [156]. Lanadelumab (Takhzyro) is a fully human mAb derived from the Dyax phage library; it directly binds the active site of plasma kallikrein to inhibit bradykinin production. Lanadelumab was approved in 2018 in the USA and Canada for prophylaxis against attacks of hereditary angioedema in patients aged ≥ 12 years [157].\", \"The success of a drug development effort is highly dependent on obtaining patent protection for products and technologies while avoiding infringement on patents issued to others. Therefore, intellectual property rights for phage-display antibody discovery platforms comprise a changing landscape that greatly affects drug development. Currently (2019), almost all of the key patents regarding phage display technologies have expired, including the Breitling/Dübel (EP0440147) and McCafferty/Winter (EP0774511, EP0589877) patents that expired in 2011 in Europe [149]. The US patents covering Dyax and Cambridge Antibody Technology phage antibody libraries have also reached the end of their 20-year protection period (Table 3). The expiration of these patents will allow more companies to create phage display human antibody libraries, advancing the march of therapeutic antibodies into the clinic. The lifting of intellectual property constraints will also spur academic institutions to translate developed phage-displayed antibodies into the clinic.\\n\", \"Many researchers have begun to take advantage of these free technologies. For example, Wayne Maraso and colleagues at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Harvard University have constructed two phage display libraries containing 12 billion (Mehta I) and 15 billion (Mehta II) human naïve scFv antibody phages. These libraries have been used to identify numerous human scFv antibodies against a variety of targets [158, 159]. James Marks’ group has also established a phage-displayed human scFv library containing 6.7 billion members at the University of California, San Francisco [98]. This library has yielded a panel of specific antibodies for membrane proteins and living tissues with sub-nanomolar affinity [98, 160, 161]. We have also established a phage-displayed human naive scFv library at the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology (ICOB) in Academia Sinica in Taiwan. The antibody gene repertoires of the ICOB phage antibody library were isolated from the PBMCs of 50 healthy human donors, producing a library size of 60 billion individual scFv clones. This collection has been successfully used to select antibodies that bind a wide spectrum of target antigens, including pure recombinant proteins, glycans, cancer cells and virus particles [99, 103, 104].\", \"The idea of producing human antibodies in transgenic mice was first suggested in 1985 when Alt et al. [166] proposed introducing human antibody genes into the mouse germline. This idea was unprecedented and provided a new direction for the development of human antibody production. In 1989, Brüggemann et al. [167] cloned the first human heavy chain construct, containing two human VH genes, for diversity segments (D) linked to the human heavy chain joining cluster (JH), and the μ constant region. The 25 kb construct was micro-injected as a mililocus plasmid into fertilized murine eggs, allowing its random insertion into the murine genome. About 4% of B lymphocytes expressed human μ chain at detectable levels in these transgenic mice. In addition, hybridomas of human IgM antibody could also be established using this transgenic strain. In 1992, Taylor et al. cloned the human κ light chain [168] construct, containing one human kappa light chain variable (Vκ) gene, the human kappa light chain joining cluster (Jκ) and kappa constant region (Cκ). While the mice expressed the human heavy chain (VH-D-JH-Cμ-Cγ1) and the human kappa light chain, the amount of human antibody was less than 10% of total antibodies, so the expression of human antibodies was not compatible with expression of mouse endogenous Ig [168].\", \"At a similar time, various murine Ig knockout mouse strains were generated. In 1993, Chen et al. knocked out murine JH and Jκ genes with gene targeted deletion, inactivating mouse Ig [169, 170]. The human IgH and IgL transgenic mice were then crossed with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice in an attempt to create lines that could generate more diverse human antibodies. In 1994, the first human Ig -transgenic mice strain, HuMabMouse [35], was generated by Longberg et al. In this line, human IgH and IgΚ are expressed in murine IgH and IgΚ deficient mice. The entire human IgH genome is about 1.29 Mb and IgΚ is about 1.39 Mb, but the human Ig genome introduced into mice was less than 80 kb [35]. Since antibody diversity comes from germline V(D) J genes, it is reasonable that the introduction of more human variable genes will lead to more diversity of generated antibodies.\", \"Likewise, Davies et al. [171] and Choi et al. [172] used yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors in 1993 to respectively construct human IgΚ (~ 300 kb) and IgH (~ 85 kb) genes via yeast homologous recombination. In 1994, Green et al. [37] constructed human IgΚ (~ 170 kb) and IgH (~ 220 kb) genome YACs and successfully introduced them into mouse embryonic stem cells by yeast spheroplast-ES cell fusion. Furthermore, in 1997, Mendez et al. [36] introduced a larger human IgΚ (~ 700 Kb) or IgH (~ 1 Mb) YAC into mouse ES cells, crossing the human Ig mice with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice to generate XenoMouse [131]. As expected, the XenoMouse only express human antibodies rather than mouse antibodies [173]. While the development of this line has eliminated the interference from mouse endogenous Ig and expanded the human Ig genes, the efficiency of human antibody generation, Ig class-switching and somatic hypermutation still remain low, due to a lack of mouse constant region gene expression [158].\", \"In order to overcome the drawbacks of a fully human heavy chain antibody, it is necessary to retain the original murine constant region. If a chimeric antibody with human Fab and murine Fc can be generated in mouse, the murine Fc would modulate the signaling for somatic hypermutation during antibody affinity maturation [158, 174, 175] and effector function of antibodies [174, 176]. Along these lines, Osborn et al. [163] linked human VH, D, and JH genes to the rat constant region locus in 2013. The large segments of human IgH and IgL were subcloned and linked by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and YAC techniques, followed by micro-injection of the minilocus plasmid into fertilized rat oocytes. Meanwhile, endogenous rat Ig loci were silenced with a zinc finger nuclease. The resulting rat strain (OmniRat) chimeric human exhibits antibody production, antigen affinity and somatic mutations similar to wild-type rats. In 2014, Lee et al. [164] utilized BACs with Cre/loxP recombination in mouse ES cells to generate a mouse strain with human VH-D-JH and Vκ-Jκ inserted directly upstream of murine Cμ and Cκ regions (KyMouse). After antigen immunization, the KyMouse can process somatic hypermutation and produce high-affinity chimeric human antibodies. In another effort, Murphy et al. [165] used BACs to assemble large human Ig genes and serially micro-injected the constructs into mouse ES cells. The human IgH and IgL genes targeted and replaced the murine IgH and IgL, upstream of the constant region (VelocImmune mouse).\", \"Generation of human antibodies by transgenic animals has been accomplished by seven companies: Abgenix, XenoMouse (purchased by Amgen in 2005); Medarex, HuMAbMouse (purchased by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2009); Ligand, OmniRat; Kymab, KyMouse; Regeneron VelocImmune mouse; and the more recent Harbour Antibodies, H2L2 Mouse and Trianni Inc., Trianni Mouse [162, 165] (Table 4). The first antibody drug derived from transgenic mice was approved by the US FDA in 2006 [177], and as of 2019, 19 transgenic animal-derived antibody drugs [17–34, 177] generated by Xenomouse, HuMabMouse, and VelocImmune mouse are on the market (Table 5). Eight of the drugs are used for cancer treatment, while the others are for autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.\\n\", \"There have been seven US FDA-approved antibody drugs generated from the XenoMouse (Table 5). In 2006, the first one, panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen, human IgG2/kappa), was approved to treat the EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS [188]. This mAb blocks the interaction of EGFR and its ligands, resulting in the inhibition of EGFR signaling and induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Two antibody drugs from the XenoMouse are used for autoimmune dermatologic diseases. One, secukinumab (Cosentyx, Novartis, human IgG1), binds to proinflammatory cytokine IL-17α to reduce inflammation in psoriasis [189]. The other is brodalumab (Siliq, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, human IgG2), which binds to the IL-17 receptor to inhibit the action of IL-17 family cytokines. The two mAb drugs were approved by the US FDA for psoriasis treatment in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\", \"From the HuMabMouse, there have also been eight antibody drugs approved by the US FDA (Table 5). Two drugs, ipilimumab (Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG1) and nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG4/kappa), are used for melanoma treatment; the drugs were approved in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, blocking its interaction with B7 on APCs and causing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill cancer cells [190]. Nivolumab recognizes to PD-1, reducing inhibitory signaling to rehabilitate the immune response of tumor-specific T cells in patients [191]. Notably, nivolumab was also approved for non-small cell lung cancer treatment in 2018. Among the mAb drugs derived from the HuMabMouse, some are used for autoimmune diseases. For example, ustekinumab (Stelara, Johnson & Johnson, human IgG1/kappa) binds to cytokines, especially the p40 subunits of IL-12 and IL-23, blocking proinflammatory signaling to ease inflammation. This drug was approved for severe plaque psoriasis [17] in 2009 and for Crohn’s disease [192] in 2016.\", \"The VelocImmune mouse is a second generation transgenic chimeric mouse and has yielded four approved drugs (Table 5). Dupilumab (Dupixent, Sanofi and Regeneron, human IgG4) binds to IL-4 receptor and inhibits the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway, as an eczema treatment. Sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi and Regeneron, human IgG1) inhibits IL-6 signaling by binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which otherwise would upregulate the release of rheumatoid arthritis-related factors from hepatocytes. The two drugs were both approved in 2017. Notably, despite having access to the XenoMouse and owning Cambridge Antibody Technology (the phage display company behind Humira), AstraZeneca paid over $120 million for a few breeding pairs of VelocImmune mice [193].\", \"To improve the diversity of products and generate better antibody drugs, major development efforts have yielded models, such as the fully human antibody mouse and second-generation chimeric human antibody mice, over the 30 years since the first transgenic mouse was generated in 1989 [167]. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provides ever more possibilities for antibody drug development by global pharmaceutical factories.\", \"Single B cells can be isolated from either PBMCs or lymphoid tissues using micromanipulation [198, 199], laser capture microdissection [200], and fluorescence-activated cell sorting [199, 201, 202]. Generally, mononuclear cells are purified from PBMCs or bone marrow by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Based on B cell expression of specific cell surface markers in different stages, isolation of single B cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting is widely utilized, especially in the identification of rare and discrete B cell subpopulations. Antigen-coated magnetic beads [203] and fluorescence-conjugated antigens [204–206] are also often used to select antigen-specific B cells in a process known as antigen baiting. Neutralizing human mAbs against Puumala virus were generated from B cells isolated using antigen-coated magnetic beads [207]. Recently, antigen-conjugated fluorescent beads have been used to identify antigen-specific B cells [208]. Fluorescent virus-like particles of rotavirus served as antigen bait for single RV-specific B cells, which had been extracted from healthy rotavirus-infected infants or adult donors [209]. HIV envelope protein antigens have also been used to isolate antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1 [210, 211]. Moreover, isolation of dengue virus-specific memory B cells was reported [212, 213]. Thus, antigen baiting may be applied as a preliminary selection tool to be used on a polyclonal mixture.\", \"After single B cell sorting, direct cloning of each Ig heavy chain and corresponding light chain should be performed [201, 202]. This step involves the use of nested or semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of the variable heavy and light chain of each identified B cell. Usually, forward primers are directed toward IgH and IgL variable leader sequences and reverse primers are complementary to the Ig constant region [201, 214]. By optimizing different primer-set mixtures, the recoveries of the VH and VL may be improved [201, 215]. The genes are then cloned and expressed in mammalian cell lines for the immediate generation of recombinant mAbs. Following the detection of mAb reactivity, the characteristics of each generated mAb are determined. Furthermore, for high-throughput screening and evaluation of secreted mAbs with ideal reactivity, a cell-based microarray chip system [216] and microengraving techniques [217–220] have been described. The cell-based microarray chip system, immunospot array assay on a chip, enables the trapping of secreted antibodies by a chip that is coated with antibody against Ig, therefore, it is used to identify and recover specific antibody-secreting cells [216]. The microengraving method depends on the use of a soft lithographic technique to generate microarrays comprising the secreted antibodies of single cells [217]. These two approaches offer the advantages of early and rapid identification of clones with high affinity and specificity to the antigen of interest.\", \"In the face of threats from novel emergent pathogens, the rapid development of immunotherapies or insights into the diversity of antibody repertoire are beneficial, and single B cell sorting provides a highly efficient technology to achieve these goals. In the past, human mAbs have been generated by the single B cell method for bacterial, parasitic, virus infected or autoimmune diseases.\", \"Among bacteria, Bacillus anthracis is one of the most concerning species. B. anthracis is a fatal pathogen that causes severe anthrax disease in humans and has been used as a biological weapon. Although antibiotics are available for anthrax treatment and as post-exposure prophylaxis, anti-anthrax protective antibodies from single human B cells will still be a crucial addition to the treatment toolkit [221, 222]. In an example targeting yeast infections, anti-Candida mAbs antibodies derived by the single human B cell method can enhance phagocytosis to protect against disseminated candidiasis [223].\", \"The single B cell method has also successfully yielded anti-viral mAbs. Rapid isolation of dengue-neutralizing antibodies from human antigen-specific memory B-cell cultures [224] and characterization of antigen-specific B cells in the peripheral blood of DENV-immune individuals [213] were both reported. In another example, Iizuka and colleagues described the identification of cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen-specific human mAbs using single B cell-based antibody gene cloning [225]. For rotavirus, the single B cell method was performed to analyze the rotavirus antibody gene repertoire of VP6-specific B cells in naive and memory B cell subsets [226] and generate rotavirus-specific human mAbs by sorting single B cells from small-intestinal mucosa [227]. Human mAbs against zika virus NS1 have also been generated by the single B cell method [228]. Besides mAbs for bacterial and virus infection, the single human B cell method has also yielded a complement factor H (CFH) therapeutic antibody for cancer. The recombinant anti-CFH antibody can induce complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) through complement activation and release of anaphylatoxins [229].\", \"Many virus-targeting mAbs are also currently in clinical trials. For example, Ebolavirus is a highly lethal pathogen that causes 25–90% mortality in humans. Therapeutic mAbs for ebolavirus infection have been derived from B cells of vaccinated human donors or survivors [230–232]. Impressively, human mAb114, which is derived from sorted memory B cells targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, protects macaques when administered as late as 5 days after challenge [231]. Clinical trials for this drug are at Phase I (NCT03478891), Phase II and III (NCT03719586).\", \"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by HIV, and an estimated 36.9 million people worldwide are infected. HIV-1 envelope protein is an attractive therapeutic target for antibody and vaccine design. Five human mAbs against anti-HIV envelope protein have been generated by the single B cell approach and are under evaluation in clinical trials (3BNC117, Phase I/II; 10–1074, Phase I; VRC01, Phase I/II; PGT121, Phase I/II and N6, Phase I) [233]. A Phase I clinical trial (NCT02579083) is also being conducted on the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus by MB 66 combined with an anti-herpes simplex virus antibody (AC8) and an anti-HIV antibody (VRC01).\", \"Different influenza viruses cause epidemics ever year, and influenza vaccines are the most useful measure to prevent seasonal influenza. Single B cell isolation for the generation of potent and broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies has become a popular undertaking [234, 235]. MHAA4549A, a human mAb targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of influenza A virus was cloned from a single human plasmablast cell from an influenza virus vaccinated donor [236]. A Phase II clinical trial of MHAA4549A as a monotherapy for acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza A in otherwise healthy adults was recently completed (NCT02623322). CT P27, which contains two human mAbs (CT P22 and CT P23), was created by Celltrion and is in Phase II (NCT03511066). RG 6024, also named MHAB5553A, was generated by Genentech with a modified version of the single B cell isolation method [237]; it is currently under examination in Phase I (NCT02528903) trial. The Phase II trial for another antibody, TCN 032, was stopped in 2012 (NCT01719874).\", \"Profiling of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody repertoires from the memory B cells of naturally infected adults [238] or generation of neutralizing antibodies from RSV-infected infants [239] has been undertaken as well. MEDI8897, an anti-RSV antibody developed by MedImmune, is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in Phase II clinical trial (NCT02878330).\", \"Over the past decade, generation of mAbs by single B cell technology has become increasingly attractive. However, there are still no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs developed by this method that is used for clinical treatment of any disease. Although single B cell technology possesses several irreplaceable advantages, there are still challenges to be overcome. For example, the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the design of primer sets are all important considerations for successful generation of mAbs. In the future, recovery of mAbs from single B cell platforms may be a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for development of novel diagnostics, pharmacokinetic applications, and clinical therapeutics.\", \"Phage display and yeast display have been widely used for affinity maturation of antibodies, due to their amenability to easily screen for high affinity variants and to high throughput applications [81]. Methods for increasing antibody affinity can be broadly divided into two broad categories. The first is to generate a large randomly mutated library of CDR or entire variable domain sequences, followed by a selection of higher affinity variants from this large number of mutants. Another approach is to prepare small libraries by focused mutagenesis or hotspot mutagenesis that mimics in vivo affinity maturation. In this focused method, a high affinity variant is selected to be randomized at individual positions in each of the six CDRs or at a discrete point in the variable domain called the hotspot. The usual practice is to combine different mutations, resulting in small increases in affinity. The combination of these different mutations may have an additive or synergistic effect that can result in substantial increases in the affinity of the antibody to the antigen [245]. Phage display technology can be employed to identify high affinity antibodies in an antibody gene mutation library under stringent biopanning conditions, including decreased antigen amount, extended incubation and intensive washing steps or by competition with soluble antigen [104, 246]. Using phage display with VH and VL CDR3 mutation libraries, the affinity of anti-HER2 antibody was improved more than 1200-fold [97].\", \"Diversification of antibody genes is the initial step of affinity maturation in vitro, and this step may be achieved using various strategies, such as random mutations, targeted mutations or chain shuffling [246]. Mutations can be randomly introduced into the variable regions of antibody genes by error-prone PCR in mutator E. coli strains [247, 248]. Chain shuffling approaches are those in which one of two chains, VH and VL, is fixed and recombined with a repertoire of partner chains to produce a next-generation library [249]. Moreover, mutations can be introduced to particular regions of the antibody gene. This type of targeting mutation approach was employed to diversify CDR residues and was shown to be effective in ameliorating the affinity of antibodies [250]. Therefore, this method is more relevant to in vivo somatic mutations during B cell evolution because mutations accumulate more efficiently in the CDR than framework residues.\", \"The field of therapeutic antibodies has undergone rapid growth in recent years, becoming a dominant force in the therapeutics market. However, there is still significant growth potential for the therapeutic antibody field. Traditionally, antibodies have been used for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. If the molecular mechanisms of a specific disease can be clearly elucidated and the specific proteins or molecules involved in pathogenesis can be identified, antibodies may provide an effective therapeutic option. For example, anti-CGRP receptor antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, or fremanezumab) have been developed for the prevention of migraine. Anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies (evolocumab or alirocumab) are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) antibody (burosumab) is used to treat X-linked hypophosphatemia. Anti-IL6R antibody (sarilumab and tocilizumab) can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Factor IXa/Xa antibody (emicizumab) is a valuable treatment for hemophilia A. Anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (caplacizumab) is approved for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other antibodies will be approved for new indications in the near future.\", \"Therapeutic antibodies can roughly be separated into two broad categories (Fig. 5). In the first category, the naked antibody is directly used for disease therapy. Cancer treatments from this category may act through several different mechanisms, including mediated pathways (e.g., ADCC/CDC), direct targeting of cancer cells to induce apoptosis, targeting the tumor microenvironment, or targeting immune checkpoints. In mediated pathways, the antibody kills cancer cells by recruiting natural killer cells or other immune cells. Recently, new technological developments have been made to enhance the therapeutic effects of ADCC or CDC, such as antibody Fc point mutations [251–253] or modification of glycosylation [254–258] to improve cancer cell killing capabilities. The direct induction apoptosis in cancer cells has traditionally been the preferred mechanism for therapeutic antibodies. With regard to targeting the tumor microenvironment, antibodies can inhibit tumorigenesis by targeting factors involved in cancer cell growth. For example, Avastin targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to inhibit blood vessel growth around the tumor, shutting down the supply of nutrients required for the cancer cell growth. Immune checkpoints have proven to be valuable targets for cancer treatment. In the future, studies evaluating synergistic effects of antibodies and chemotherapeutic drugs, radiotherapy or other biologic agents will greatly benefit the further development of antibody therapeutics. Furthermore, the identification of novel biomarkers may improve the efficacy and specificity of antibody-based therapy for human diseases.\\n\", \"In the second category of antibody drugs, additional modifications are made to the antibody in order to enhance its therapeutic value. Some general approaches include immunocytokines, antibody-drug conjugate, antibody-radionuclide conjugates, bispecific antibodies, immunoliposomes, and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. To create an immunocytokine, a selected cytokine is fused to an antibody to enhance delivery specificity [259]. Antibody drug conjugates consist of an antibody that targets a cancer-specific marker conjugated to the small molecule drug; the antibody enhances delivery to the tumor site, increasing the efficacy of the small molecule while reducing side effects by reducing non-specific toxicity to non-target tissues [260]. The antibody may also be conjugated to a radionuclide, in order to direct radiotherapy more specifically to the tumor site [261]. For bispecific antibodies, antibodies targeting two receptors are engineered to further enhance therapeutic effects [262]. Antibody-engaged effector cell functions may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bispecific antibodies. With regard to immunoliposomes, the binding site of the antibody (scFv or Fab) is cleaved from the constant region and subsequently conjugated to different nano-drug delivery systems, such as liposomal drugs, to provide more specific targeting [263, 264]. Lastly, CAR-T involves inserting the gene for a chimeric T cell receptor-antibody targeting a specific cancer marker into T cells, such that the engineered cells target and kill cancer cells [265, 266]. In recent years, this approach has garnered major attention from the scientific and medical community due to its significant clinical benefits to cancer patients. In many cases, patients have experienced complete remission or even been completely cured of cancer [267–271].\", \"Although new methods have been well-established for generating fully human antibodies, such as human antibody transgenic mice and human single B cell antibody techniques, phage display still has advantages as an antibody drug discovery platform, based on its efficient and economical in vitro selection methodology. Recently, some advanced techniques have been applied in antibody discovery, including high-throughput robotic screening [272], next generation sequencing [273] and single cell sequencing [274, 275]. These techniques are expected to greatly accelerate the identification of specific phage binders, facilitating mAb development for use in research, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals for the treatment of human disease.\", \"By reviewing currently approved mAbs, one may easily see how sophisticated formats were developed in response to challenges posed by therapeutic indications. These mAb engineering solutions are highlighted by antibody-drug conjugates, glycoengineered mAbs, immunomodulators, bispecific mAbs, and CAR-T cells.\", \"Here, we summarize five technical platforms that are related to the production of therapeutic antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, humanization, phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology (Fig. 3d). Phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology have proven to be reliable methods for the generation of human antibodies. As enormous storehouses of antibody encoding genes (> 1010) with unknown properties, high quality (antibody diversity) phage antibody libraries are critical to the successful identification of therapeutic mAbs. In addition, an optimal selection from phage display libraries is dependent on target antigen quality, antigen immobilization, and tight control of binding and wash conditions. Furthermore, careful pre-screening design of conditions can tailor the characteristics of antibodies discovered from biopanning, including conformation specificity, epitope specificity, internalization, neutralization, and interspecies cross-reactivity. Currently, there are nine fully human antibodies that were discovered from phage libraries approved for therapy, and dozens more phage-derived antibody therapeutics are in clinical trials, waiting to enter the market [149] (Table 5).\", \"In order to improve the quality of antibody drugs, researchers have developed several transgenic animals, including fully human mice and second-generation human chimeric mouse. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provide more options for antibody drug development in global pharmaceutical factories. All the transgenic-derived mAbs approved for therapeutic use have come from from three companies: Abgenix (XenoMouse) [36], Medarex (HuMAbMouse) [35], and Regeneron (VelocImmune) [165]. Depending on the immunization protocol, high affinity human antibodies can be obtained through selection of the clones generated in the animals. This selection is mainly accomplished by hybridoma technology. Currently, there are 19 approved human mAbs that were discovered from these three transgenic animals (Table 5).\", \"Over the past decade, generation of mAbs from isolated single B cells has become an increasingly attractive approach. To date, no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs have been derived from this method; however, it possesses several major advantages, and ongoing challenges are currently being solved. The success of the method relies heavily on the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the set of primers used for amplification. In the future, the recovery of mAbs from single B cells is expected to become a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic application, and clinical therapeutics.\", \"As a result of highly active development of antibody drugs in recent decades, mAbs have emerged among the major class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of many human diseases, especially cancers, immunological, infectious, neural and metabolic diseases. Sales growth and regulatory approval of mAb products were slow until the late 1990s when the first chimeric mAbs were approved (annual sales of $0.3 billion in 1997). With the subsequent approval of humanized and then fully human mAbs, the rate of product approvals and sales of mAb products has increased rapidly, with global sales revenue for all mAb products at $115.2 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1) [276]. The continued growth of mAb products in the coming years is expected to be a major driver of overall biopharmaceutical product sales.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31894001/\"\n}];\nconst similar_paper_1_1 = [{\n  paper_id: \"PMC7207137\",\n  doi: \"10.1053/j.jvca.2020.05.004\",\n  title: \"COVID-19 outbreak in France: Setup and activities of a mobile Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) team during the first 3 weeks\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-05-08\",\n  authors: [\"Guillaume.Haye\", \"Alex.Fourdrain\", \"Osama.Abou-Arab\", \"Pascal.Berna\", \"Yazine.Mahjoub\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Start of the outbreak in Picardy\", \"Start of the outbreak in Picardy\", \"Setting up the mobile ECMO team\", \"Setting up the mobile ECMO team\", \"Number of calls and patients’ characteristics\", \"Number of calls and patients’ characteristics\", \"Declaration of Competing Interest\"],\n      generic: [\"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Located in the north of France, Picardy region has a population of 1.925 million inhabitants on a 19 399 km² territory. A network of 29 general hospitals is located on this regional territory, with 128 intensive care units (ICU) beds. The only ICU of Picardy with the ability to manage ECMO is the Cardiac Thoracic Vascular and Respiratory Unit of Amiens University medical Centre. The unit initiated about 60 ECMO treatments every year (one third of veno-venous ECMO) for more than 10 years.\", \"The outbreak occurred in Picardy at the end of February 2020 resulting in a rapid tension on ICU beds. Calls from peripheral centres for ECMO need increased rapidly. In one month (March 2020), 676 patients were admitted in the hospitals of the region for COVID-19 related disease. Among them 156 patients required ICU admission (admission rate: 23.1%).3\\n\", \"Clustering infected patients requiring ECMO within an expert centre was necessary in order to insure adequate care and resource management.\", \"A unique phone number was publicized to all ICUs of the region in order to centralize request for ECMO. An on-call ECMO team member was able to give advice and to evaluate the need for ECMO. All ECMO team members were educated on the management and the eligibility criteria for ECMO initiation. The mobile ECMO team was composed by a specialized intensivist, a thoracic surgeon and a trained perfusion nurse. A roster was started in order to make the team available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Decision to initiate ECMO treatment was always a multi-consultant decision. The ECMO team was able to reach any hospital of the region in less than 45 minutes (by road or by air depending on the weather). The ECMO team decided on arrival to retrieve the patient on conventional ventilation or to initiate ECMO on site and transfer the patient on ECMO support. Patients under ECMO were admitted in a specialized ICU with trained staff. The Cardiohelp® (Maquet Medical system, Wayne, USA) ECMO device was used for each transport because of its compact and light design (10kg).\", \"During March 2020, 22 calls were received at our ECMO centre. The ECMO team initiated 8 veno-venous ECMO treatments on site and transferred 3 patients on conventional ventilation. For all patients, the drainage cannula (size of 25 Fr) was inserted in the right femoral vein and the return cannula (size of 19 Fr) was inserted in the right jugular vein. Heparin treatment was started after the procedure with continuous perfusion of unfractioned heparin for an anti-XA level target of 0,2-0,4 UI.ml−1. Despite this treatment, canula thrombosis occurred for 2 patients leading to procedure failure and death of the patients. This is probably due to the high inflammatory state that increases the risk of thrombosis as suggested in some reports.4 The ECMO team was not available 3 times due to simultaneous calls. Only one ECMO was initiated during night shift. Four patients (50%) were discharged from ICU. Characteristics, outcomes and complications of patients were detailed in table 1\\n. The role of ECMO in covid-19-related ARDS is still unclear. To date, only limited case-series are available. Our report is in accordance with previous reports on limited cases-series of Covid-19 patients under ECMO support. Li et al. reported a similar rate of 50% of weaning for 8 patients under ECMO.5 Jacobs et al. in a larger case-series of 32 covid-19 patients under ECMO, have a weaning rate of 16% (5/32) but the majority of their ECMO treatment were still ongoing at time of publication.6 To the contrary to other team, we performed only veno-venous ECMO therapies as all treated patients were hemodynamically stable without acute ventricular dysfunction.7\\n\", \"To conclude, the setup of a mobile ECMO team within an experienced ECMO centre is feasible and may help to tackle the outbreak. To date, there is only limited case-series on ECMO for covid-19 patients and larger studies are mandatory to draw any conclusion.

As of the end of 2011, the number of HIV-positive people worldwide had reached 34 million. In response to this situation, the United Nations released its 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS. As of 2012, 186 countries or 96 % of United Nations members had submitted a report on their national AIDS-response measures (UNAIDS) [4]. Figure 5.1 indicates the size of HIV-positive populations, showing from left to right the infection rates among adults, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. It is striking that the HIV-positive rate among drug injectors is 22 times higher than among the general population.\\n\", \"The background to this situation regarding HIV infection is a story of massive spread of infection through an accident with ‘high-risk biotechnologies’ [5]. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal refers to a series of cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, caused by the failure to apply safety measures to blood products. Included in these blood products were coagulation-factor products, which are pharmaceuticals effective against hemophilia. The raw material for these products is prepared from the blood of many donors, and the lack of a procedure for virus inactivation left no defense against viral infection. The reported discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 led to concerns over the risk of infection through blood products, but despite the warnings from many specialists, the use of these products continued and resulted in some 2,000 cases of HIV infection. According to a 1997 White Paper from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, of the 4,028 people with HIV as of February 1997, 1,872 had been infected by blood products. Meanwhile, of the 1,484 people who had developed AIDS symptoms, 641 had been infected by blood products. The reality was that almost half of those with HIV infection were victims of the scandal. This affair raised issues regarding the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the culpability of the involved organizations and individuals in industry (pharmaceutical manufacturers); in government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare); and in academia (the AIDS Research Group led by Dr. Z).\", \"Iatrogenic HIV infection differs from many other cases of iatrogenic drug damage in that it is a ‘progressive condition’. What this means is that even when use of the drugs stops, the progression of the symptoms does not. This is because iatrogenic HIV infection arises not from the drug’s side-effects, as with most other cases of iatrogenic drug damage, but from viral contamination of the blood that is the raw material for the drugs (Osaka HIV) [6]. In the absence of effective therapy, HIV causes a gradual weakening of the immune system, leading to the onset of AIDS. As of July 1998, there had been 493 deaths from iatrogenic HIV infection, while the number infected was 1,434, of whom 631 had developed AIDS. The number of deaths continues to increase. The fact that many children were affected is another distinctive feature of iatrogenic HIV infection, making all the more urgent the task of limiting the damage and developing therapies. Of those affected, 14 % were 10 years old or younger, while 30 % were 15 years or below, and those aged 20 or below accounted for more than half of all victims. This is why, in the first report by the Research Group for Preventive Therapies for People with HIV Infection, the group’s chief researcher, Professor K. Yamada, called iatrogenic HIV infection “one of the greatest medical tragedies of this century”. The group’s report is subtitled The AIDS Scandal [7].\", \"Table 5.1 summarizes the iatrogenic HIV problem in terms of the number of HIV-infected people and the (estimated) number infected by blood products in the major developed countries. The number of people infected iatrogenically through pharmaceuticals is particularly high in the United States and France, indicating that the damage was spread through a combination of natural and human-made disasters. In many countries including Japan, court actions were brought against the government and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In Spain, where 90 % of blood-coagulant products were imports from the United States, it is reported that 82 % of the 2,700 hemophiliacs became infected with HIV (Osaka HIV) [8].\\n\", \"In the case of the ‘non-heat-treated’ coagulation-factor products which were the medium of infection, although there were safety issues involved, the fact remained that they were effective for many hemophiliacs and user-friendly. The coagulation-factor products had a stronger pharmaceutical effect than the cryoprecipitate preparations which were candidate replacements, and, when symptoms became severe, there were apparently cases in which only coagulation-factor products could elicit recovery. Moreover, self-injection of coagulation-factor products by hemophiliacs was authorized in February 1983, offering a greater degree of user-friendliness than cryoprecipitate, which in principle had to be administered in a hospital. As HIV research was less advanced than nowadays, many doctors and patients opted for the immediate benefits of pharmaceutical efficacy and user-friendliness in the face of an unknown future risk, resulting in the unforeseen human-made medical disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection.\", \"Central government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) continued to assume the role of the supervision and guidance authority for pharmaceutical approval and licensing in its relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pharmaceutical manufacturers submitted detailed reports on risk data and other information to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which provided them with guidance on the range of countermeasures. The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected information from overseas specialists, but this information was not communicated to medical treatment institutions, patients, or the general public. At the time of the first confirmed case, the Ministry tried to prepare a ‘soft landing’ for AIDS in Japan. Similarly, so as to avoid panic among the public and unequal treatment of companies, it continued to advocate a softly-softly approach. In court, too, the government went on to adopt the role of director and defender of the accused companies. In addition to this aspect, there was a strong significance attached to the fact that the disease was infectious, which meant that the damage spread through secondary and tertiary infection. Surprisingly, as the Ministry initially treated HIV as a public health and sanitation issue, it did not provide victims with medical treatment, relief or compensation, thinking of the infection rather as a social evil which needed to be rooted out and eliminated.\", \"Detailed information on the timeline of the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal has appeared on the website of Life AIDS Project and in a book by Hitoshi Sakurai entitled Umoreta eizu hōkoku (The Buried AIDS Report) [9]. The timeline presented below was prepared with reference to these sources and is based on factual information already released into the public domain.\\n\", \"Hemophilia, a disease in which constituents required for blood clotting and hemostasis are lacking or deficient for genetic reasons, requires medical treatment to supply these missing blood-coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitates products were used as drugs to control the disease [10]. As cryoprecipitate products are made from the pooled blood of one or at the most ten individuals, it was expected that they would be less likely to cause infection than coagulation-factor products, which are made from the pooled blood of between 2,000 and 20,000 people [11]. As the first cryoprecipitate were frozen products, their storage and use presented challenges, and patients had to be treated in hospital, but this problem was resolved by the dried cryoprecipitate developed in the early 1980s, and home treatment using cryoprecipitate did apparently take place in some cases. In countries such as Norway, which actually switched to cryoprecipitate, the rate of hemophiliac HIV infection was kept to low levels, indicating effective decision-making on health policy. This fact casts doubt on the basis of Dr. Z’s statement that ‘cryoprecipitate is liable to solidification’, and instead points to the difference in drug-price markup as one of the possible reasons why the switch to cryoprecipitate was not realized.\", \"From 1984 until around 1985, many Japanese doctors viewed as specialists and many officials at the Ministry of Health and Welfare were apparently dominated by the ‘logical argument’ that “although use of blood products can lead to HIV infection, many patients have not developed symptoms. Infection and onset of symptoms are thus separate phenomena. Although ‘non-heated products’ may be a cause of HIV infection, they do not act to cause AIDS onset” [12]. AIDS is a disease of immune dysfunction caused by a virus called HIV. In a document published in 1986, Dr. Z maintained that confirmation of AIDS requires three conditions to be fulfilled [13]. The first was infection with the AIDS virus, which could be tested via the presence of antibodies. The second was reduced or insufficient immunocompetence. The fact that this reduction of immunocompetence occurs over time is one of the characteristics of AIDS. For reduced immune function to result in the onset of symptoms can take more than 10 years in many cases, until which time the patient may experience no more than a certain degree of fatigue, with no impairment of everyday activities. This is still one of the features that distinguish HIV infection from the onset of AIDS. The third of Dr. Z’s conditions was opportunistic infection, which appears as a result of weakened immunocompetence in the form of illnesses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma. As a result, medical treatment following the onset of AIDS consists of a constant battle with opportunistic infections.\", \"Figure 5.2 shows the number of new HIV and AIDS infections and deaths in the two subsequent decades from 1990 to 2010. Many HIV-infected patients die each year; the total number of those infected is shown in the figure. When we consider also the number of AIDS deaths due to non-pharmaceutical-related natural infection, such as infection through unprotected sex or needle-sharing, the extent of the tragedy is immeasurable. The problem of iatrogenic AIDS thus continues into the present.\\n\", \"In the case of iatrogenic HIV infection, the main point of legal contention was at what juncture pharmaceutical manufacturers and the Ministry of Health and Welfare had become aware of the risk from non-heated products. The case in point in the criminal trial was that of a liver-disease patient treated with non-heated products from the pharmaceutical company Green Cross Corporation in April 1986. The court attempted to trace why the president of the corporation had not recalled the products, and why Mr. Y, the then head of the Biologics and Antibiotics Division at the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, had not ordered a recall.\", \"Since pharmaceutical manufacturers were also in a position to access risk data, they were unable to deny their involvement in the manufacture and sale of drugs potentially contaminated with the virus. Information from pharmaceutical manufacturers was reported to the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, but was not communicated to the hemophiliacs who were the product consumers. The Ministry thereby clearly neglected its duty to warn patients and the public. As for non-heated products, while most other countries reduced their imports, Japan sought to increase imports and even reduced the price as an incentive. The reason for the import of unsafe ‘non-heated products’ was quite simply the prioritization of earnings from the markup on the drug price. This is the profit derived from the difference between the fixed domestic price for medical products and the price actually paid to the overseas supplier. The markup on non-heated products was particularly great. With cryoprecipitate products, in contrast, there was almost none. There are also issues associated with the actions of those involved after the danger was realized: even after heated products became available, they failed to urgently recall the non-heated products which they knew to be unsafe. By making false reports to the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the dates of market release and recall of non-heated products, the Green Cross Corporation engaged in fraud and misrepresentation compounding the damage, for which it bears a grave ‘social responsibility.’\", \"Figure 5.3, stakeholders of the pharmaceutical industry, presents a diagrammatic illustration of the interest groups in the industry involved in the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing. As shown, Green Cross effectively engaged in bribery, which included making payments, disguised as ‘research funds’, to a foundation that Dr. Z was in the process of establishing, suggesting that the ‘business ethics’ of this pharmaceutical operator were very poor. Its approach, which prioritized its own interest at the expense of patients and the public, aggravated the damage. However, this kind of poor practice was not restricted to the corporate players; responsibility also lies with the government authorities that administered the pharmaceutical regulatory system, which became ever clearer as the Japanese media (NHK) delved more deeply into the scandal.\\n\", \"The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had the role of providing supervision and guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Notwithstanding its name change to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare following a ministerial reorganization, its historic responsibility for the iatrogenic HIV infection remains, together with its duty to compensate patients and victims. This raises the question of the political and administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities. Although it may not have been deliberately responsible, if it is the case that the former Ministry of Health and Welfare sacrificed the health of hemophiliacs for the sake of pharmaceutical manufacturers’ profit, then the regulatory authority itself has become a malignant influence on society, a situation that calls for the establishment of an ethical code for government organizations. The pharmaceutical regulatory system has been called a ‘web of vested interests’. The sorting of good medicines from bad is carried out under government guidance through a process known as pharmaceutical inspection, but, paradoxically, there is greater interest vested in bad medicines than in good medicines. Pharmaceutical companies make massive capital investment in drug development and have to adapt to new raw materials and a new production line for each new drug. They need to recoup this investment, and the development of a single drug is thus a kind of venture project that can determine the entire fate of the company.\", \"Because of this, once a drug had been developed, since it was no longer possible to halt the investment in the associated production plant, the company would approach official bodies and the specialist committees and research groups that had the effective decision-making authority within the pharmaceutical-inspection system of the former Ministry of Health and Welfare with the intention of having the drug approved, regardless of its merit. It was this network of interests surrounding pharmaceutical regulation that formed the backdrop to the tragedy of iatrogenic HIV infection. Meanwhile, the inspection procedures and clinical studies involved in drug licensing under the government regulatory system require time, something which often stands in the way of delivering medical treatment to patients who need the drug. Indeed, one wonders what the purpose of the government regulatory system is, and whether the clinical studies involved in pharmaceutical inspection have any useful effect. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal provoked a loss of confidence in the pharmaceutical regulatory system, and the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and initiated a fundamental questioning of the whole of Japan’s medical-treatment policy.\", \"The administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities involved in the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) was the focus of the court case. In court, the basis for the questioning of the Ministry’s responsibility was the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was amended in 1979 in response to the SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) case. The amendment gave the Ministry the authority to close down the supply of a pharmaceutical where there was the risk of it creating or aggravating a health or safety hazard. At issue was the failure to exercise this authority, in other words negligence on the part of the regulatory authority. Specifically, it can be pointed out, for instance, that Japan lagged behind the United States by 2 years and 4 months in the approval of heated products. This was largely attributable to the coordination of clinical studies by Dr. Z, but another probable issue was the structure whereby the former Ministry of Health and Welfare’s pharmaceutical-licensing operation was dependent on a small number of specialists. Table 5.2 summarizes the dates from which HIV-antibody testing and heat treatments of concentrated products were made obligatory.\\n\", \"Documents now made public suggest that, although the former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected a large amount of risk data, it not only did not make the data public but may actually have manipulated the advice from the FDA. AIDS was first recognized in Japan on March 22, 1985, with the reporting of the case of a male homosexual resident in the United States, which became known as the Juntendo University case. The patient survived for 10 years after diagnosis, and, although infected with HIV, is thought to have been yet to develop AIDS at that time. In contrast, a hemophiliac who died in July 1983, known as the Teikyo University case, was not recognized as an AIDS patient. It has been claimed that this was because the former Ministry of Health and Welfare tried to conceal the fact of hemophiliac HIV infection. Even subsequent to the licensing of heated products, the Ministry exacerbated the damage by failing to order pharmaceutical manufacturers to recall unheated products. Underlying this lax leadership is a readily perceptible collusion between the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Green Cross Corporation of those days was described as an outpost of the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and the practice of amakudari, whereby officials from the Ministry frequently retired into sinecure positions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, led to the formation of strong collusive relationships in the area of pharmaceutical approval and licensing (Mainichi Shimbun Shakaibu) [14].\", \"As shown in Fig. 5.4, the background to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal was formed not only by the various contributions of industry, government and academia, but also by the undeniable fact of mutual interorganizational relationships among the three based on an ‘industrial protection policy’ peculiar to what has been called Japan Inc. It was surely the collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia based on the ‘vulnerable systems’ in Japanese society [15]—a negative result of the interrelationship of organizations in Japan’s industrial society—that lay behind the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal.\\n\", \"The head of the AIDS Research Group, Dr. Z, was at the time Japan’s foremost expert in hemophilia treatment, and was thus an influential and authoritative voice in the field of medicine relevant to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal. The AIDS Research Group was in fact heavily involved in important decisions that led to the compounding of the damage from the iatrogenic HIV infection, such as the decision not to switch from coagulation-factor products to cryoprecipitate products. Specifically, at the meeting of the Home Treatment Promotion Committee on October 18, 1983, Dr. Z said in respect of his earlier claim that ‘cryoprecipitate tends to solidify’ that it might not be true. At a time when there were doubts over the safety of blood products, a grave responsibility attaches to his decisions not to switch to cryoprecipitate products, and then to delay the clinical study of the heated products when he should have been working to provide a safer drug as quickly as possible. In connection, it was found that doctors had had financial dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which was proven by the fact that Green Cross had made donations, disguised as research funds, to a foundation established by Dr. Z.\", \"As part of the July 1997 reorganization of the pharmaceutical regulatory structure recommended in the 1997 Annual Report on Health and Welfare, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau was abolished, and the Health Policy Bureau took control of policy on the promotion of pharmaceutical research and development, pharmaceutical production and distribution, and related aspects. Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau was created to oversee the broad range of safety measures relating to medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, such as pharmaceutical clinical studies, approval and inspection, post-marketing safety measures, and measures to prevent infection within medical-treatment institutions. In parallel, as part of a strategic upgrade and reorganization of testing and research institutions, the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences was reconstituted as the National Institute of Health Sciences, and was equipped with a Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center to promote survey and research work on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs and strengthen pharmaceutical inspection. To coincide with the reorganization, there was a systematic increase in the number of staff assigned to pharmaceutical inspection work, and the inspection system was changed: whereas previously the actual work of inspection had been delegated to the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, whose members were drawn from the outside, the core work of pharmaceutical inspection was now to be carried out in-house by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center, with the Council’s role specialized to cover high-level assessment. Urgent steps were to be taken to set up a corresponding system of responsibilities. The system of clinical-study principal investigators, which had been Dr. Z’s role in the licensing of heated products, was abolished.\", \"The new medical-product approval and inspection system created by the reorganization of government agencies came into force in 1997. In subsequent administrative reforms, the former Ministry of Health and Welfare became the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare, and there were changes in the content of its administrative activities including services provided and approval and licensing operations. Under the previous system, Inspection Guidelines and Inspection Reports were submitted to the Investigation Committee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, which was made up of specialists from outside the Ministry. This system was replaced in November 2000 by a simplified format in which the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council participated in a so-called team inspection. This move appears to have been designed to shorten the time required for approval.\", \"In the final analysis, the cause of the iatrogenic HIV infection lay in a system in which the government agencies that constituted the pharmaceutical regulatory authorities were essentially bypassed so that the effective ‘decision-making’ body for drug clinical-study approval was the specialist committee known as the AIDS Research Group, to which pharmaceutical manufacturers made donations in an effort to have their pharmaceuticals approved and licensed, thus interfering in the process of pharmaceutical approval and license renewal. In future, lessons must be drawn from the iatrogenic HIV infection, and reform must be applied to the web of interests in the pharmaceutical industry and its system of cozy collusive relationships with government agencies. The poor practice and collusive relationships arising from the network of interests linking the worlds of industry and government also exemplify the need to reform, in terms of both policies and systems, the ethos and culture which became entrenched during Japan’s earlier period of rapid economic growth. An existing organizational culture must not be allowed to prevent the organization from learning to find its way in a new age. Dismantling the old culture of the past and creating a new culture is an important process. The culture of poor practice which is latent within the pharmaceutical regulatory system and the pharmaceutical industry represents a form of ‘organizational inertia’ which still today retains the power to act against the public interest. The culture and ethos latent in this network of collusive relationships among Japanese industry, government, and academia may need to be the subject of creative destruction as we move into the near future.\", \"It is clear that responsibility for the organizational disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection lies at once with industry, government, and academia, but the background to this is the industrial-protection policy of Japan Inc., which is deeply rooted in the culture of the pharmaceutical industry. The system for approval and licensing, as administered by the regulatory government authority for each industry, itself spawned a network of collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia through practices such as amakudari, donations from private-sector bodies to the public sector, and expense-account entertaining. The case of iatrogenic HIV infection can be seen as a negative result of this relationship between business and government. This underlines the fragility of the ‘cultural ethos’ [16] of Japanese industrial organizations and typifies a system common to all of Japanese industrial society: a veritable ‘Galapagos, a strange, isolated world’.\", \"Human-made disasters such as the phenomenon of iatrogenic AIDS infection outlined above have an inevitable ‘teleconnection’ with natural disasters. New viral strains and infectious diseases are one form of ‘unsafety threatening humankind.’ Historically, tuberculosis, cholera, plague, influenza, AIDS, and other infectious diseases have claimed many victims. More recently, the worldwide spread of SARS and avian influenza in 2003 is fresh in our memory. There are fears of epidemics of the three major infectious diseases (AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis) arising from the ‘biological hazard’ caused by the world population explosion to 7.2 billion. The particular danger of biological hazard is its exponential pattern of spread. Explosive damage arises through bacterial and viral infection via living organisms, person-to-person infection, or cross-species infection, for example from cattle to humans through bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), and foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, rubella infection in pregnant women may cause cataracts and glaucoma, congenital heart disease, hearing impairment, and other conditions in the fetus, while congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) poses the risk of damage to the next generation. Whether this is regarded as a case of human-made or natural selection, the result is the same: the disaster leads to an indivisible resonance phenomenon, the negative interaction of which causes the accelerated spread of ‘unsafety’.\", \"The WHO has published Fig. 5.5 worldwide to signal the risk from biological hazards. The northward spread of infectious tropical diseases caused by recent global warming is proceeding at an ever-accelerating pace. Among the hazards facing the world, the proportion represented by these biological hazards is second in number only to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, typhoons and hurricanes, and accounts for one-third of all hazards.\\n\", \"Meanwhile, there is concern that global warming’s disruption of the energy balance may allow the spread of infectious tropical diseases to the northern hemisphere. The serious prevalence of West Nile fever in the United States resulted from its being spread to the temperate zone of North America by travelers. In Japan, similarly, the example of the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti), which was discovered in Osaka Prefecture and has extended its habitat to the whole country, demonstrates that this is not an insubstantial problem. In particular the recent prevalence of Dengue-fever, whose incidence has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years, means that over 100 countries are threatened by the growth of the domain of infection (WHO) [17]. Figure 5.6 shows areas with high risk of Dengue-fever infection as of 2011. The lines to the north and south of the figure indicate the minimum temperature of 10 °C delineating the habitat limit of the mosquito that transmits the Dengue-fever virus. Advancing northward like an army, global warming is extending the habitat of the mosquitoes that transmit tropical viruses and is pushing the infection toward the northern hemisphere, which has a large land mass and is home to a large proportion of the human race. This poses a threat to the populations of these areas, who have no experience of or resistance to tropical viruses, diehard by global-warming.\\n\", \"Not only the abovementioned infectious tropical diseases transmitted by bacteria and viruses, but also the risk of infection spread through global warming and the resulting crisis, will be of increasing concern going forward. For instance, since cholera bacteria live in symbiosis with plankton in seawater, the rise in sea temperatures, causing plankton to breed more prolifically, also leads to an increase in cholera bacteria, which has extended its infection zone northward. Already, it is reported that the 1991 El Niño phenomenon in South America has led to sharp year-on-year increases in cholera cases. The IPCC report from the end of September 2013 states that the world’s average atmospheric temperature rose by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 and predicts that the temperature rise by the year 2100 will be up to a maximum of 4.8 °C, leading to fears of a ‘Global Big Melt’, which will precipitate a worldwide struggle over water and food resources (IPCC) [18]. The freshwater available on the planet for human consumption as drinking water is said to represent 0.008 % of all the earth’s H2O, so a Global Big Melt would mean the depletion of the water resources for the human population of 7.2 billion now. Especially in the northern hemisphere, which contains a high proportion of the planet’s land mass, the melting of glaciers and permafrost soil to which the Big Melt refers is predicted to lead to the spread of viral infection to previously unaffected areas. Combined with ‘trans-global movement’ of travelers and migrants, and biological weapons, terrorism, and other disasters arising from human-made unsafety, these outbreaks could spread worldwide.\", \"Governments and the responsible departments of regulatory authorities are loath to recognize ‘socio-biological hazard’. The leak and spread of radioactivity following the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, although a question of life and death for local residents, the wider community, and the Japanese population as a whole, were hidden by the government and the company involved. Socio-biological hazard thus cannot be controlled by central government policy or corporate management, which instead frequently responds with concealment or falsification of information. Nor is it susceptible to control by social or other systems. Outbreaks or pandemics of social or biological problems are accompanied by the breakdown of social functions, indicating the limitations of policy and management at the level of national government and business organization.\", \"Unlike war, coups d’état, and conflict, the influx of people into an area of hazard results in new infections as contamination with the pathogen spreads along the chain among the members of families, communities, and organizations. National governments and the WHO have, albeit discreetly, sounded the alarm over the worldwide spread of locally endemic diseases not only through mosquitoes, ticks, and migratory birds, but also through human movement (travelers on business or otherwise). A crucial role in the infection zones has been played by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, known for its role in the discovery of SARS. In such a spread of infection, as in the model predicted by J. Reason, [19] accidents and disasters leak through security holes, author which suggests a resonance between human-made and natural disasters.\", \"To summarize, the increased risks and crises brought about by global warming can emanate through leaks in physical, social, and biological defensive barriers. The resulting human-made disasters have already brought about systemic breakdown on various fronts. The ‘survivability’ which is a defensive barrier programmed into human DNA does not operate in C. I. Barnard’s so-called ‘zone of indifference’, where hazard is neither made known nor perceived. Consequently one could suggest, in many cases, hazard is only registered when a crisis emerges from the damage due to the spread of infection instigated in the breakdown of health and sanitation and other social systems and functions (Fig. 5.7).\\n\", \"A comparison of viral outbreaks on a global scale, such as the worldwide pandemic of iatrogenic AIDS, reveals a similar structure. First of all, insufficient information disclosure allows an influx of people into the infection area; secondly, government measures to suppress infection and efforts at an organizational level by corporations or other bodies remain weak; and thirdly, there is a “zone of indifference outside the infection area.” These three factors create disregard for hazard information (de-civilization). Accurate publicity of ‘socio-biological hazard’ is therefore essential at the levels of international society, government, corporate organizations, and the individual, while also urgent are preventing unnecessary or unauthorized business visits or travel to the hazard area and other issues of organizational compliance and governance, together with Human Resource Management (HRM). The northward spread of tropical infectious diseases through global warming has created a need for social systems at various levels, including those of government, corporate organizations, and the individual. This means that the concept of an ‘eco-civilization’—promoting coexistence at the level of the social ecosphere, and associated disclosure of information—is the only viable approach to suppressing the combination of human-made and natural disasters that constitute socio-biological outbreaks and pandemics.\", \"In April 2002, eastern Asia was struck by the SARS virus. Following the noble efforts made by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, alerts were communicated worldwide through WHO. At the time, I was due to leave for a period of external research at IMD Lausanne, and my office urged me to proceed with the departure from Kansai Airport despite the risk of spreading the SARS infection. However, I defied them and postponed the departure. It was precisely on the day of my scheduled departure that Kansai Airport was subjected to a major disinfection operation as a precaution against SARS. The decision to postpone my departure after consulting my departmental head was a close call. If I had left on that day, I may have spread the infection to my research host institution at the IMD, and the SARS infection could have been transmitted after my return to many of my students and teaching colleagues. The conclusion to be drawn from this episode is that, going forward, whatever the field of work and in the management of organizations of all kinds, response to viral outbreaks will become an urgent task for participants in and administrators of business travel. I pray for the repose of the souls of those who died of SARS and influenza.\", \"The recent hostage killings in Algeria and the deaths of journalists in Syria serve to illustrate that the managerial staff who issue the order for overseas business trips not only have managerial responsibility for the individual organization, but may also bear lifelong moral responsibility and a duty to compensate the families of injured junior staff for their trauma and emotional suffering. Accordingly, it has become essential for modern management to prepare for socio-biological hazard in organizational management by providing managerial staff with training in risk, crisis and resilience management. Reviewing the ups and downs of the Japanese economy, one recalls that, after the collapse of the bubble economy, a large portion of the sharply increased number of suicides from overwork that resulted from mass layoffs and staff cuts was represented by managerial staff which had fired their colleagues.\", \"Coincidental though it may be, I was in the countries at the time of the military coup d’état under the Fujimori government in Peru and the coup d’état at Bangkok airport in Thailand. The Great East Japan Earthquake, the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, and the death of a student in a Japan Railways accident are also among my various experiences of accident and disaster. It was because of these that I entered my present field of research with the aim of averting suffering caused by avoidable human-made disasters.

Using a Markov model for a cost-benefit analysis, prophylactic probiotics (with subglottic endotracheal tubes) showed cost benefit for preventing VAP, with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 50,000–100,000 USD (70,807–141,614 CAD) per case of VAP averted (median [range] cost estimate of 15,958 USD [7,000–35,000] or 22,623 CAD [9,913–49,566] per VAP case). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between probiotics and no probiotics showed dominance of probiotics over placebo (with usual care). Sensitivity analysis showed continued dominance in a multiple scenarios (reducing cost of VAP, and increasing hourly nursing wages). There was a substantial increase in cost-savings with probiotics when VAP risk reduction was increased vs placebo.18\", \"Among six studies examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics in CDAD (Table 3), four studies found probiotics to be cost-effective/incremental cost-saving,20,22–24 one study showed no difference,19 and one study showed cost-effectiveness in certain scenarios.23\", \"Kamdeu Fansi et al. found a cost-savings dose response for probiotics vs placebo.

Among economic evaluations included in this review, incremental costs/ICERs were expressed in costs per healthcare-associated infection event prevented, but heterogeneity in reporting prevented meta-analysis conduction. Further, variable time horizons make comparisons of economic evaluations problematic (specifically ICERs) as costs and resource utilization may change over different time horizons. Changes in time horizons or perspectives can lead to differing parameters (costs [direct vs indirect], or outcomes [patient vs payer]). Many studies only reported incremental costs rather than true ICERs. Results from different perspectives, time horizons, and variable incremental cost reporting all represent disparate cost outcomes, which need to be interpreted carefully within context.\", \"Moreover, there are large ranges in WTP, which are difficult to interpret with no conventional WTP benchmarks for prevention of VAP, CDAD, and AAD. Different countries may differ on values quality of life and WTP, making benchmarks difficult to establish across jurisdictions. Cost-utility parameters (like cost per life-year or QALY gained) were less commonly reported. If cost per QALYs were available, it would help to inform economic comparisons with other healthcare interventions.\", \"Compared with other infection-prevention strategies, probiotics appear to be similarly cost-effective. A study examining concomitantly administered central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSIs) and VAP programs combined documented ICERs of 14,250.74 USD (20,533.24 CAD)/life-year gained and 23,277.86 USD (33,540.02 CAD)/QALY.47 Multifaceted quality improvement programs for reducing CLABSIs in ICUs have shown dominance (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in 80% of model scenarios using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.48 A proactive model infection-control program for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in general-surgical ICUs showed an ICER of 3,804 USD (5,320.01 CAD) per case averted of transmission of MDR organisms in one year compared with standard infection control. For a WTP threshold of 14,000 USD (19,579.43 CAD) per transmission averted, there is a 42% probability of being cost-effective, and 100% probability when WTP thresholds were 22,000 USD (30,767.68 CAD).49 These similarities suggest that adoption of probiotics for prevention of healthcare-associated infections could be cost-effective.\", \"New interventions studied in economic evaluations are occasionally sponsored by drug manufacturers. This potentially introduces bias in model construction and interpretation of results. In a retrospective analysis of 107 studies in five leading medical journals with regard to outcome and sources of funding, trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were more likely to favour the new drug over traditional therapy.50,51\", \"In our systematic review, three studies were funded by manufacturers and all found the sponsored intervention to be more economically attractive, which could suggest potential publication bias (although this was not proven). This is tempered by three of four peer-review funded studies that also showed cost-effectiveness. Hence, methodologically rigorous trials with concomitant economic evaluations from peer-review funded studies are needed to ensure proper interpretation of results.\", \"Strengths of our review include adherence to rigorous methodology, consisting of a comprehensive search strategy, broad eligibility criteria, and study selection by two independent adjudicators to minimize selection bias.17 We conducted data abstraction and appraisal in duplicate, using established criteria for assessing economic evaluations.11 We performed assessments of study quality employing ROB assessments, including assessment of source studies utilized in model-based economic evaluations.13–15 We performed assessment of level of certainty using GRADE.17 We also addressed the relationship of for-profit industry sponsorship potentially influencing the reporting of economic evaluations.\", \"This review also has limitations. The inclusion of only seven studies influences precision. Rare product-specific complications such as probiotic-induced complications (i.e., bacteremia) are unclear, underscoring the need for additional safety data. Overall GRADE certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes, rendering conclusions non-definitive. Our review included only adult patients and may not be applicable to pediatric populations. Evaluated reports varied widely with respect to patient population, time horizon of therapy, and payer perspective, which challenges the generalizability and interpretation of these findings.\", \"This systematic review found that probiotics may be an economically attractive strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections in most studies. Nevertheless, our GRADE summary indicates a very low quality/certainty of evidence, such that inferences are weak regarding the health economic evaluation of probiotics in adult hospitalized patients. Future RCTs should include concomitant economic evaluations, including clinical outcomes and costs associated with probiotics, to inform bedside practice, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policy.

Healthcare resources and staff have been immediately redeployed towards COVID-19 management, with consultations for chronic diseases being canceled, postponed, or converted to tele-medicine [1, 2]. However, in the upcoming months, COVID-19 is expected to circulate and, thus, a large amount of consultations will be converted to tele-medicine, especially for diseases causing chronic disability and requiring immunomodulatory treatments, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) [3].\", \"MS is characterized by acute-onset neurological symptoms (relapses), and chronic disability, which are primarily evaluated on neurological examination [4]. Following the COVID-19 emergency, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has published recommendations for implementing a tele-medicine service, suggesting that general neurological examination is feasible remotely, but with some caveats [5]. For instance, there are difficulties in comprehensive examination of eyes (i.e., fundoscopy), neuro-muscolar components (i.e., reflexes), and vestibular system (i.e., Dix-Hallpike maneuver), while the evaluation of other neurological systems depends on the tele-neurology setup (i.e., space enough for gait examination), and the availability of a caregiver to help (i.e., sensory examination) [5]. Remote examination could be further implemented with the use of digital technology, such as smartphone accelerometers for gait, posture, and balance assessment [6]. Similarly, over the past years, different studies have already explored the feasibility of remote counseling in MS, but have focused on specific aspects of the disease (e.g., treatment adherence, mental health) [7–9]. As such, there is no general agreement on MS-specific neurological examination on tele-consultations. Hereby, we have briefly reviewed available tools for remote evaluation of disability progression and relapses in MS, and have suggested a battery for tele-neurology examination in MS.\", \"In MS, different neurological systems are combined into the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is the standard tool for clinical practice, observational studies, and clinical trials [4]. The possibility of assessing the EDSS remotely has been explored, but would require to use an “in-home neuro kit” with vision card, tuning fork, pin, cotton swab, and alcohol swab [10], to have a caregiver helping with the examination [9, 10], and to combine records from wearable devices (e.g., accelerometer-based step counts) [7, 9]. As such, remote EDSS faces some organizational issues, which would be difficult to overcome in the short term, but could be considered when strictly required (e.g., patients included in research protocols). Also, data from wearable devices should be interpreted cautiously, considering that the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological symptoms may not necessarily correspond to reduced physical activity in patients already self-isolating at home.\", \"On the contrary, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) would remain entirely feasible online. The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) has been specifically developed as a PROM of MS disability and has been validated in multiple languages, and also for online administration [11]. The PDDS is strongly correlated to EDSS, and especially to visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and ambulatory functional systems, leaving brainstem and cerebral functions relatively unexplored [12]. As such, if patients are required to fill in the PDDS before tele-consultations, remote examination could specifically focus on brainstem function (e.g., ocular movements, trigeminal damage, hearing loss, dysarthria, and dysphagia), which is possibly easier to examine remotely or, at least, on history taking. Looking at cerebral function, different neuropsychological tests have been assessed for remote use [13]. Among them, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), which measures attention and processing speed, holds strong correlates to disability progression, and has been suggested as a screening tool for cognitive impairment in MS [14]. The oral version of the SDMT has already been validated for remote use (e.g., online or during functional-MRI acquisitions), is ideally suitable for all languages [14], and, thus, could be easily used on tele-neurology.\", \"Relapses are defined as the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological abnormalities, which are separated by ≥ 30 days from the onset of the preceding event, last for ≥ 24 h, and occur without fever or infection [4, 15]. Thus, if some elements are relatively easy to evaluate on remote history taking (e.g., timeline, concomitant fever or symptoms of infection), neurological abnormalities would need to be detected as suggested above, along with other neurological tests in relation to reported symptoms. However, relapses also affect quality of life and activities of daily living [15], and, thus, the inclusion of MS-specific PROMs measuring physical and psychological health could support the assessment of relapse severity. For instance, the MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29) has been used in clinical trials to evaluate recovery from relapses [15], and has been tested for remote administration [16]. Alternative scales could be considered depending on prevalent patients’ symptoms (e.g., mood, fatigue). However, in-person examination and/or MRI should be considered for cases where a relapse cannot be fully ruled out, in order to make timely treatment decisions [4].\", \"Overall, we have suggested a battery for MS assessment in tele-neurology, which strongly leverages patients’ empowerment and PROMs (Table 1). In particular, we recommend MS patients fill in the PDDS and the MSIS-29 before the tele-consultation, so that neurologists have a full view on the overall physical and psychological status. Then, during the tele-consultation, neurologists can focus on history taking and examination of brainstem function and other neurological systems, as required by patients’ symptoms. Finally, if necessary, the examiner could administer the oral version of the SDMT by showing the test form on patients’ screen. Alternatively, patients could be provided with PDDS, MSIS-29, and an electronic version of the SDMT [17], for self-assessment, and, then, request tele-neurology if necessary. The PDDS, the MSIS-29, and the SDMT could be integrated to video-consultation platforms or electronic health record systems, or be implemented using other online tools, such as Google Forms.\", \"Limitations of tele-neurology include the availability of technology to deliver tele-consultations (e.g., webcam quality, high-speed connection), which need to be accounted for by policymakers to avoid healthcare inequalities.\", \"In conclusion, though the medical management of COVID-19 is the current healthcare priority, chronic diseases should not be left unattended, and the use of common tools for neurological examination could improve tele-neurology practice, and quality of care for people with MS.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440979/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04470-x\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7152917\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.04.008\",\n  title: \"Overcoming Speech and Language Disorders in Acute and Critical Care: 40 Years Later\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-04-13\",\n  authors: [\"Mary.Happ\", \"Jiwon.Shin\", \"Judith.Tate\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\n      generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"As our Geriatric Nursing anniversary year recognition continues, we are examining the topic of speech and language disorders in older adults during acute and critical illness and how attention to this topic has (or has not) changed in the past 40 years. In 1981, Geriatric Nursing published a classic, comprehensive overview of the assessment and treatment of speech and language disorders in older adults written by Barbara Dreher.1 “Overcoming Speech and Language Disorders”1 focused primarily on communication disorders resulting from stroke and laryngectomy. Several of the principles and interventions to improve communication presented in 1981 (e.g., modifying speaking and listening, maintaining quiet environment, and directions for the specific type of communication impairment) are still fundamental today in communication care for patients with stroke, and for a wide range of communication disabilities. Notably, the role of the speech language pathologist (SLP) in diagnosing and treating communication disorders was highlighted. Several communication tools such as communication boards with pictures, words, and letters and electronic voice synthesizers introduced in this article 40 years ago1 are still used for non-vocal patients in the acute care setting. We now have more advanced communication tools and nurse-led research testing the usability and efficacy of several of these tools.2\\n\", \"Our understanding of the problems of communication disability, the conditions associated with impaired communication, and the health and safety risks of communication disability in the acute care of older adults increased tremendously over the past 40 years. Our view of communication disability expanded to include sensory impairments (i.e., poor vision or hearing) that affect receptive and expressive communication, limited English language proficiency, and poor health literacy. Similarly, attention to conditions beyond stroke that are associated with impaired communication include a host of neurocognitive (dementia) and neuromuscular (Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) disorders as well as situational conditions in acute and chronic critical illness (mechanical ventilation) that prevent vocal communication.\", \"Over the past 40 years, we witnessed advancements in hearing aid technology, and advocacy for hearing assessment and hearing aid access for older adults. However, less than 20-25% of persons who may benefit from hearing amplification devices or hearing aids own them, largely due to stigma, cost and access barriers.3 Hearing amplification and the availability of amplification technology for hospitalized older adults who are hard-of hearing is still widely variable in acute care hospitals despite Joint Commission standards mandating hospitals to accommodate communication disability.4 Experts recently called for increased attention to and enforcement of the Joint Commission standards specific to hearing amplification during acute care hospitalization.4\\n\", \"Missed communication and misinterpretation are recognized as patient safety issues for hospitalized adults as evidence shows that persons with communication disabilities have greater risk for preventable adverse events during hospitalization.5 The inability to access nurse call systems due to paralysis or weakness contributes to missed communication and is another form of communication impairment often experienced by hospitalized older adults, yet overlooked in care improvement initiatives. Zubow and Hurtig6 reported that 33% of conscious patients in intensive care units are unable to use the conventional nurse call systems to initiate communication of basic needs.\", \"Our research and the work of colleagues in communication disorders science over the past four decades show that several common techniques that nurses rely on to communicate with nonvocal patients may contribute to misinterpretation of patient messages. For example, although many nurses rely on lip-reading to communicate with non-vocal patients, this technique requires formal training and is prone to misinterpretation.7 Nurses often assume that family members can interpret a patient's communication attempts during acute/critical illness, but family members report frustration and an inability to accurately interpret the patient's non-vocal messages.8 Communication impairment can affect symptom recognition by nurses and accurate pain assessment, in particular, can be problematic when patients have communication difficulty.9\\n,\\n10\\n\", \"Multidisciplinary collaborations of communication disorders scientists, nurse researchers, and engineers led to improvements in low tech, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools (e.g., simple and complex communication boards, non-English language translations), clinician training in basic communication skills and AAC techniques, and electronic communication devices and tablet applications,2 including systems with nurse call features,11 for use in medical settings. A hospital chaplain developed and tested a novel spiritual care picture communication board, to support chaplain communication with non-vocal patients, showing an association between chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care and reductions in anxiety and stress during and after an ICU admission. 12 Many older adults prefer low tech AAC tools, but are still able and interested in using electronic tablet communication applications for medical encounters with appropriate demonstration and instruction.13 These studies and initiatives also highlight and extend the role of the speech language pathologist in providing instruction, consultation and support for complex communication needs of acute and critically ill older adults.14\\n,\\n15\\n\", \"Unfortunately, although AAC tools and trainings directed at the communication needs of acute and critically ill adults improved over the past 40 years, dissemination, implementation and uptake are quite slow. Barriers to widespread availability and competence in the use of AAC tools and techniques in acute and critical care include competing priorities, lack of knowledge, perceived time commitment, and a general lack of programmatic ownership in many institutions for the provision of communication support. Our colleagues across the country continue to report a lack of training on how best to communicate with communication-impaired patients, unavailability of communication supplies at the bedside, and underutilization of inpatient SLP services for communication support consultations.\", \"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which disproportionately affects older adults in terms of severity and need for mechanical ventilation, sets an urgency to dissemination of communication materials and education and support for bedside providers.\", \"Tragically, due to the isolation precautions necessary to prevent the spread of this devastating infection, family members are not able to attend at the bedside of patients with COVID-19. These critically ill patients and their family members are not able to benefit from patient-family centered communication interventions that could help them make sense of and process the critical illness event.16 ICU clinicians are required to fill the void. They need access to simple communication tools to quickly and reliably interpret COVID-19 patients’ messages.\", \"In addition to being unable to communicate their needs and questions without voice, these mechanically ventilated patients may also have difficulty understanding instructions and messages from care providers who are wearing protective masks. A national group of experts created a suite of free communication tools, non-English translations, and tips https://www.patientprovidercommunication.org. The ‘case example’ tab provides exemplars of older adult patients with COVID19 to illustrate how speech language pathologists work with nurses to construct reliable methods to communicate with COVID-19 patients. They do this by observing from outside the isolation room, through iPad video connections, etc. The Ohio State University College of Nursing continuing education platform provides evidence-based communication training modules, brief demonstration videos, low-tech communication tools and a decision pathway for clinicians at https://go.osu.edu/speacs.\", \"In summary, we know what to do and have some great tools and resources to provide comprehensive communication support to older adults with communication disability during acute and critical care hospitalization. However, these resources (e.g., hearing amplification, communication boards, writing tools, electronic devices, and SLP consultation) are not standardized or readily available in many acute care hospitals. Moreover, most interprofessional teams are not trained in communication assessment and the use of assistive tools and techniques tailored to an individual patient's abilities and preferences. We hope that, in response to the enormous influx of older patients who need assistive communication during this pandemic, nurses and other members of the interprofessional team will access the free tools and training.

Therefore, to understand whether there are new shared expectations about the prompt reporting of disease outbreaks and the extent to which these expectations have altered state behaviour, we need to examine behaviour in the immediate post-SARS setting. The aftermath of an event such as SARS is the perfect time to examine whether that sense of urgency generated by the crisis can be utilized to achieve long-term behavioural change (Whelan, 2008) . David Heymann (2006, p. 352) has argued that this behavioural change is already evident: 'the detection of, and international response to, the SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that countries are willing to forgo the exclusive privilege of reporting and responding to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories in a manner over which they have supreme control'. He goes on to note that the East Asian response to Avian Influenza (AI), H5N1, which (re)appeared in December 2003 in poultry and went on to infect humans from 2004, 2 was indicative of a normative change where the duty to report prevailed over the financial and political costs of not doing so.\", \"This article examines Heymann's claims in more detail. Did East Asian states, affected by H5N1 human infections in the immediate aftermath of SARS, satisfy expectations about their duty to report disease outbreaks promptly and transparently? The H5N1 outbreak is particularly interesting given that it emerged at a time when states were formalizing these new responsibilities in the revised IHR, which were then under negotiation (2004) (2005) and that some states affected by H5N1 -China and Vietnam especially -were still recovering from SARS when this outbreak occurred. What is of particular interest is the alternative suggestion to Heymann (2006) , which is that some degree of 'rebalancing' and reassertion of sovereignty occurred in the context of H5N1 in response to the overt interference of the WHO in domestic responses during SARS (Calain, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Hoffman, 2010) .\", \"The article will proceed with a discussion of the post-SARS environment, and then examine how the International Relations (IR) literature has understood the events that followed during the H5N1 outbreak. I outline a common understanding that has emerged of the H5N1 outbreak, which suggests that East Asian states 'reverted to type' and reasserted their sovereignty by refusing to cooperate with disease reporting requirements. However, this interpretation is not based on an empirical assessment of how states actually behaved. To remedy this, I test the extent to which states engaged in 'frank and prompt reporting' (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) during the H5N1 outbreak. Doing so reveals that states did overwhelmingly meet this duty, even during the years when they were not legally bound to do so (which was not until the IHR revisions came into force in mid-2007) . I conclude that although sovereignty is undoubtedly an important influence on state behaviour, it need not be seen as antipathetic to states fulfilling their duty to report.\", \"The SARS outbreak, which emanated from South China in early 2003, has been identified as the trigger for inspiring states to accept these new duties to report disease outbreaks (Heymann and Rodier, 2004) . However, even during the SARS outbreak, there was evidence of shared expectations about prompt reporting that led to international demands that the Chinese government engage in open and transparent reporting behaviour with neighbouring states and the wider international community, which was not at that point prescribed by international law (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . According to David Fidler (2004, p. 116) , expectations that China should report a disease outbreak not covered by existing international conventions revealed that the WHO and the wider international community had 'begun to move beyond the state centrism of Westphalian public health'.\", \"However, even before SARS, states were progressively expecting new reporting behaviour. For instance, it has been argued that the WHO's response to SARS and states expectations during SARS were possible because of the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 54.14, agreed to in 2001 (Fidler, 2004, pp. 117-118) . WHA 54.14 (2001) was the first expression of an expectation that states had a duty to report outbreaks that could pose an international risk, and when they did not report an outbreak they expected the WHO to request for further information. This was dramatically new terrain for the WHO and for the states (Kamradt-Scott, 2010, p. 82), but the passing of this resolution arguably demonstrated states commitment to the concept even if the resolution itself was non-binding.\", \"There is no doubt that SARS acted as the crucial 'tipping point' that galvanized states to accept the need for a new standard of reporting behaviour (Davies, 2011, p. 435) . However, this could not have occurred without the WHO's earlier efforts to promote new behaviours in the field of disease reporting and states acceptance of this need in 2001. During the SARS outbreak, a critical mass of support for the duty to report was again reached during the 2003 WHA. WHA Resolution 56.28 (2003) was unanimously passed, calling for completion of the revised IHR (1969) framework and draft regulations to be in place and ready for adoption by May 2005 WHA meeting (Whelan, 2008, p. 6 ). In the same resolution, it was noted that the as yet unrevised IHRs were 'inadequate' and failed to include specific actions required of member states and the WHO (WHA 56.28, 2003) . Member states thus agreed that even before the adoption of the IHR revisions, they would 'establish immediately a national standing task force or equivalent group and, within it, to designate an official or officials having operational responsibilities and accessible at all times by telephone or electronic communication, to ensure the speed, particularly during emergencies of both reporting to the WHO and consultation with national authorities when urgent decisions must be made' (WHA 56.28, 2003: Paragraph 3[2] ).\", \"After SARS, the shared expectation that states would report openly and promptly was again reaffirmed. At the WHO Global Conference on SARS in June 2003, all states agreed that: 'Information should be communicated in a transparent, accurate and timely manner. SARS demonstrated the need for better risk communication as a component of outbreak control' (O'Malley et al, 2009, p. 614) . SARS was particularly exceptional because it exposed that a legal prescription for the duty to report was not the driving force required to change behaviour. SARS simply provided the 'critical mass moment' to turn that growing social expectation -states should report to each other openly and transparently -into prescribed practice (Davies 2011, p. 433) .\", \"But how should we understand the emergence of this duty to report and what impact it has had on state behaviour? Why would states agree to a behavioural expectation that may be politically or economically costly? One view is that the risk of not reporting has become more risky for the sovereign than to openly report. Price- Smith (2009, pp. 143, 149) notes that China -the country most recalcitrant in reporting the extent of their SARS cases -was also the country that paid the highest economic and political cost. In other words, self-interested behaviour can remain the dominant norm for the sovereign state -but what defines self-interest is not static -it too changes through interaction with the wider social environment (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, p. 912 ). As such, constructivists have argued contra the neo-utilitarian view of liberal and realist perspectives that the evident readiness of states to agree to shared rules that constrain their behaviour demonstrates the degree to which global governance frameworks shape state identity, function and roles. In other words, 'a core constructivist research concern is what happens before the neo-utilitarian model kicks in' (Ruggie, 1998, p. 867, emphasis added) . In the area of health, the IR focus has been how to explain why the increase in global frameworks to address health concerns that were traditionally under the (confident) management of the state (Zacher and Keefe, 2008, p. 20) . One explanation is that the 'transition of public health governance on infectious diseases [for example] from the traditional Westphalian framework to something new y highlights changes that may be occurring to the general structure and dynamics of international relations in the era of globalization' (Fidler, 2004, p. 8) . This age of post-Westphalian global health governance has seen states socialized into cooperating in global governance frameworks and come to view such cooperation as serving their interests whether by resolving problems that cannot be resolving unilaterally or by reducing transaction costs through cooperation (Fidler, 2004) .\", \"Under the leadership of the WHO Headquarters in the mid-late 1990s, initiatives such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria achieved political and donor support that was relatively unprecedented (Lee et al, 2002; Ricci, 2009) . From this perspective, the IHR revisions were just one of the several recent examples of states agreeing to sacrifice portions of their sovereign privileges by committing themselves to comply with international standard setting. SARS simply 'changed the calculus of the material interests of member states to reflect the threat that disease posed to their material interests, resulting in rapid innovation and change of the existing regime' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154 ).In the case of the IHR revisions, three of its revised demands that are especially significant for enshrining the duty to report over the core interest of state sovereignty (Mack, 2006, p. 366) are: (i) the duty of the state to notify the WHO within 24 hours of any emergency that may constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); 3 (ii) the duty to contain the outbreak at its source; and (iii) the obligation of national authorities to respond to the WHO's request for further information (WHA 58.3, 2005: Articles 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12; Mack, 2006) .\", \"Having briefly documented the emergence of the 'duty to report', the article now turns to examine the extent to which it has influenced the reporting behaviour of East Asian states affected by the H5N1 outbreak.\", \"The H5N1 AI outbreak was first identified in poultry in East Asia in December 2003. The first cases of human infection with H5N1 were in 2004, with nearly all cases of human infection resulting from direct contact with poultry. 4 The concern with H5N1 in the early days, which somewhat remains, is that H5N1 AI virus 'remains one of the influenza viruses with pandemic potential, because it continues to circulate widely in some poultry populations, most humans likely have no immunity to it, and it can cause severe disease and death in humans' (WHO, 2011a) .\", \"From 2003 to 2011, the highest cumulative total of human infections (and deaths) were (in order) in Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam (WHO, 2011b, see Table 1 ). The disease appeared to peak in 2006, when the highest number of human cases of infections appeared (most occurring in Indonesia). By 2010, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and China were the only countries to continue to experience human cases of infection (WHO, 2011b) .\", \"H5N1 was first identified in poultry in South Korea in December 2003. In the same month, Thailand raised the alarm when the H5N1 virus strain was discovered in sick tigers and leopards in the Bangkok Zoo, which was traced to infected poultry being fed to the animals as the cause of their infection. Retrospective analysis in 2006 revealed that the first possible H5N1 poultry The international politics of disease reporting and human cases emerged from China in November 2003 (WHO, 2011c). This case was most likely confused for a SARS case (Schnur, 2006) .\", \"In January 2004, Vietnam reported its first poultry outbreak of H5N1, followed in the same month by Japan, Hong Kong, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Indonesia's first report of poultry cases came in February 2004, at the same time as mainland China reported its first poultry cases (WHO, 2011c). In January, Vietnam reported its first H5N1 human case. By February, there were fears that the disease had already adapted to human transmission when a cluster of cases from one family was identified in Vietnam in February 2004 (WHO, 2011c). In the same month, Thailand reported its first two human infections (direct from poultry). By the end of 2004, Vietnam and Thailand confirmed six and five human infection cases, respectively. By 2005, Cambodia, China and Indonesia had confirmed cases of H5N1 human infections. By the end of 2005, Indonesia had the highest human case load of infections with 20 cases (WHO, 2011c). To get a sense of how serious the potential threat was, it is worth noting that the fatality rate for humans infected with H5N1 was 73 per cent in 2004, 63 per cent in 2005 and 43 per cent in 2006. Moreover, 90 per cent of the cases were in people under the age of 40 years (WHO, 2006) .\", \"At the outset of the H5N1 outbreak, there was no formal requirement for states to report and verify the disease because the revised IHR had not yet come into force (they did not do so until mid-2007). As the rate of infections The duty to report notwithstanding, there were several prima facie reasons to expect that states would not report H5N1 in a timely manner. First, states were not legally required to do so for the first three and a half years of the outbreak, as such governments might have been expected to comply only with their formal legal obligations (Lee and Fidler, 2007, p. 220) . Second, the financial costs associated with confirming H5N1 outbreak, especially the destruction of poultry stocks and associated farming livelihoods, posed a major deterrent to reporting (Scoones and Forster, 2010) . Third, these financial costs would also create additional political costs by devastating already vulnerable communities and placing intense pressure on governments to compensate and provide reassurances to save affected industries (Forster, 2010; Herington, 2010; Safman, 2010; Vu, 2010) . Despite these barriers, the literature has characterised the reporting behaviour of affected states as falling into one of the three categories: those that positively complied (Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia), those that did so more shakily (China, Thailand) and those that outwardly challenged the duty to report itself (Indonesia, Thailand). The general observation has been that the deterrents did not wholly inhibit reporting, but there were variations in how states understood their duty to report. Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia were generally viewed as being positive, and presented as evidence of states embracing the need to engage in the global health governance framework to ensure greater assistance in identifying and preventing the outbreaks (de Sa et al, 2010) . When inevitable delays in reporting was noted in these countries, it was reported as being due to capacity failures rather than direct political intent to deceive the international community or domestic audiences about the extent of the outbreak (Boltz et al, 2006; Ear, 2010; Herington, 2010; Coker et al, 2011) .\", \"At the same time, other states were criticized for their failure to adhere to the new duty to report, in particular prompt reporting and verification to the WHO of suspected outbreaks. In the second group, China's retrospective release of information in 2006-2007 for outbreaks in [2003] [2004] was met with some suspicion, with analysts asking whether these delays were the product of technical incapacity, bureaucratic difficulties or attempts at obfuscation (Chanlett-Avery et al, 2006, p. 10) . Thailand and Indonesia were regularly criticized for substantial lags in their initial reports of poultry and human cases, with it being revealed in both instances that the governments knew of the possible cause but delayed the release of laboratory findings (Butler, 2005; Butler, 2006; Sipress, 2009) . Thailand especially came under attack in the early stages of the outbreak.\", \"The presence of large poultry industries in Thailand was especially identified as the possible cause of initial secrecy (Forster, 2010; Safman, 2010) .\", \"However, the third behavioural category challenged the duty to report itself. Although the issue of virus sharing did not come under the auspices of the IHR (1969 or 2005 versions) , several analysts saw Indonesia's move as a broader bid to challenge its putative obligations under the revised IHR (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Smith, 2012) . Major concerns arose when Indonesia refused to share samples of the H5N1 virus from January 2007. Before this, it had been a long standing practice, as the creation of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) under the WHO's management in 1951, for states to share their influenza virus strains with all WHO collaborating laboratories (located in selected national laboratories) to allow them to assist with the production of vaccines and monitoring of virus strain mutation. Indonesia's refusal to share strains via the GISN raised concerns about the potential for states to assert 'viral sovereignty' as a way of reasserting themselves in the face of global health governance (Holbrooke and Garrett, 2008; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009 , pp. 1386 -1387 .\", \"The Indonesian Ministry of Health argued that it withheld the virus samples because virus sharing was unjust when the supplying country could not be guaranteed equitable access to vaccine and antiviral treatment from the developed countries that primarily manufactured these products on the basis of the viruses freely given (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Eighteen months later, in June 2008 (and a year after the IHR [2005] had come into force) then Indonesian Health Minister Dr Siti Fadilah Supari further questioned whether the government should even regularly report H5N1 human infections to the WHO (Branswell, 2008) . 5 Dr Supari's suggestion was seen as a significant challenge to the duty to report. However, in their written justification over the virus-sharing dispute, the Indonesian Ministry of Health did not refer to Dr Supari's comments regarding the IHR. The Ministry argued that their primary concern in terms of IHR reporting was the government's decision to conduct case confirmation within country rather than sending samples to a WHO collaborating laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Although the Ministry did apparently delay announcing some H5N1 human infections, particularly during 2009 where there are no details on such outbreaks on the WHO's Disease Outbreak News (DON) Website, the WHO Headquarters has continued to argue that it was promptly informed by the government of every outbreak during this period (Branswell, 2008 , Interview, 2011d . Indeed, the Indonesian government immediately supplied confirmation of two H5N1 human cases days after Dr Supari's comments (Reuters, 2008) . Nonetheless, Dr Supari's actions concerning virus samples and musings on the IHR gained support from other member states in the 'developed South' and particularly Asia sparking discussions about 'developing countries [being] increasingly suspicious' of the global health security initiative that inspired the IHR revisions (Aldis, 2008) . Moreover, although the Indonesian response during H5N1 was only one of three variants evident during the crisis, it is the one that has received most attention.\", \"The culmination of these events during the H5N1 outbreak, particularly instances of delayed reporting by China and Thailand, and the virus sharing challenge by Indonesia, prompted some analysts to question the post-Westphalian optimism expressed in the introduction and immediately after SARS. Indeed, this view has come to include some notable earlier advocates of the post-Westphalian era (Fidler, 2010b) . It has been suggested that the arrival of a 'post-Wesphalian era' has been 'overstated' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154) , and shared expectations around the duty to report may not be sufficient to induce states to change their behaviour and that powerful countervailing sovereign interests will likely override the perceived duty to report (Hoffman, 2010, pp. 514, 519) .\", \"Two principal sets of explanations were offered to explain this apparent backlash. The first concern was that the securitized rhetoric attached to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s had been accepted so readily that states were coming to view it as legitimate to (re)assert their sovereign right over their reporting behaviour, response and control of specimens. When disease outbreaks were associated with great economic costs -as was the case for Indonesia and other affected states -states were encouraged by securitization to respond through a security lens and privilege unilateral action over multilateral cooperation (Calain, 2007; Elbe, 2010; Forster, 2010 ; on costs see Coker et al, 2011) . As Stefan Elbe explained:\", \"As fear about the threat of a possible human H5N1 pandemic spread across the world, many governments scrambled to stockpile anti-viral medications and vaccines, albeit in a context where there was insufficient global supply to meet such a rapid surge in demand. Realizing that they were the likely 'losers' in this international race, some developing countries began to openly question the benefits of maintaining existing forms of international health cooperation. (Elbe, 2010, p. 476) The second explanation was that 'WHO illustrated during the SARS crisis what leadership in global health looks like in a post-Westphalian world', that H5N1 reaffirmed that this had the potential to not just be an anomaly, and that this had prompted some states to respond by protecting their sovereignty from what they now viewed as a sustained attack (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009, p. 1390) . According to this line of thinking, the assertion of 'viral sovereignty' during H5N1, predominantly led by Indonesia but with the tacit support of the region (Fidler, 2010a, p. 288) , could be understood as a statement (predictable perhaps as noted by Smith, 2012 ) that states could question their duty to report to the WHO in the manner proscribed and expected. It has also been argued that the significance of WHA resolutions has been overstated. For example, WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) only called for states to 'voluntarily' comply with the revised IHR in their response to H5N1; regardless of the phrase adopted, WHA resolutions are not legally binding resolutions (Irwin, 2010, p. 9 ). The Indonesian-led opposition may also be interpreted as an inevitable backlash against what many saw as the WHO overstepping its role in 2003 during the SARS crisis (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . From this perspective, the cooperation enjoyed during the SARS crisis was a product of exceptional circumstances and outside that context states would revert to type and seek to control outbreak news and manage their own response to outbreak events (Smith, 2010) .\", \"There are, however, at least three problems with these dominant understandings of how East Asian states responded to the H5N1 outbreak. First, adherents to this line of thinking need to explain why sovereignty concerns seemed to matter more for some states than for others. As I noted earlier, Indonesia and Thailand are assumed to be more protective of their sovereignty than both Cambodia and Vietnam. Given regional similarities in their dispensations towards sovereignty and the fact that the latter countries have been subjected to conflict and external aggression in the past few decades, the norm of sovereign non-interference alone cannot explain the variance in their behaviour (Vu, 2011) . Second, too much weight is given to Dr Supari's comments and there is little evidence to suggest that they were part of a more concerted push against the duty to report or other global health governance norms. Supari's (speculative) comments were offered once in an interview given only 1 year before she stepped down as Health Minister. Beyond this, there is no other prima facie evidence that Indonesia proved more resistant to promptly reporting H5N1 outbreaks to the WHO authorities. Third, and crucial for establishing the second point, claims about the sovereignty backlash are made in the absence of empirical evidence about what states actually did in terms of their reporting behaviour of H5N1 human infections from 2004 to 2010. Establishing the reporting behaviour of H5N1 affected states over a sustained period of time, rather than providing selective snapshots, will go a long way to establishing whether states have in fact modified their behaviour in line with shared expectations about the prompt reporting of diseases.\", \"This section examines the extent to which East Asian states complied with the duty to report by examining every report of H5N1 infection in the region between 2004 and 2010, noting not just official (government) confirmations of outbreaks, but the outbreak reports provided to the WHO by governments. Because of the variation in languages and different styles of reporting outbreaks via official Ministry of Health Websites (that is, some states report weekly or monthly, some report all immediate suspect outbreaks, some only report laboratory confirmed outbreaks), I examined the public communication of outbreak events by all states that recorded H5N1 human infections in the East Asian region between 2004 and 2010 via one disease monitoring website, ProMED Mail (PMM). 6 I then compared the reports for each case under PMM with the issuing of WHO alerts on the same outbreak that are usually released by the government for the WHO to then post on its DON site. 7 PMM is one of the oldest (created 1994) independent (non-state managed) publicly available International Surveillance and Response Programs, with a high correlation between its initial reports and event verification (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Hitchcock et al 2007) . It has strong moderator presence and access to subscribers who provide important insight into outbreak events that may have otherwise been overlooked if not for these 'insider informants' using PMM to communicate outbreak events (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Brownstein et al, 2008) . Although the moderated service of PMM means that there is the potential for a report to be discarded because of the moderator believing it not to be relevant, or for a disease outbreak to be missed because the system does not use a text mining tool (that sifts news media source providers such as FACTIVA), PMM has been widely acknowledged as often pre-empting WHO receipt of reports, and accurately reporting outbreak events confirmed by the WHO (Madoff and Woodall, 2005, pp. 725-727; Conway et al, 2010) . 8 Table 2 details how the reports were identified and the countries for which reports were collected. I compared reports of H5N1 human infections on PMM with WHO receipt of reports, over a 6-year time span to indicate how states actually behaved in relation to the putative reporting duties. Within the PMM reports I noted whether there was a high volume of 'informal' reports or 'rumours' being circulated about any particular outbreak that was not confirmed by the government. The number of rumours per year per country were so low that I did not include this data. In sum, PMM reports detected nearly all outbreak reports attracted government response. Although the WHO DON site does not report all outbreaks reported to Headquarters (Interview, 2011a), here we may observe whether there is a general trend of governments reporting outbreaks to the WHO and to what extent states sought to comply with this new duty to report.\", \"When the reporting behaviour was collated (see Figures 1-3) , it became clear that states were almost consistently maintaining the lead in reporting human outbreaks. Of particular interest, H5N1 reporting steadily increased after 2006, but just as crucially reporting rates to the WHO were highly correlated with official reports. This is of note considering that the IHR did not come into force until mid-2007, and as noted by others, prompt compliance with the IHR prompt reporting procedure was voluntary under WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) at this time (Irwin, 2010) .\", \"The core findings from my data set are threefold. First, Figure 1 demonstrates that the East Asian region had a steady reporting pattern that correlated closely with the number of cases in the region for that period, as shown in Figure 2 . In 2005 and 2006, the peak years for H5N1 human infection cases, affected governments were issuing regular updates of outbreaks. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the number of reports that the government were issuing and the confirmations by the WHO (which can only be publicly provided after receipt of government information). In 2005, there were only 10 official reports concerning outbreak events that were not published on the WHO Website -this is for all the three governments that had human infections that year (Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam). In 2006, there were only eight official reports released by the five governments that experienced outbreaks, which were not published on Vietnam. In addition, countries that did not have a case threshold of 5 or above were excluded (that is, Lao PDR, Myanmar); Cambodia was included due to regularly reporting for nearly all of the years examined. Finally, Bangladesh has reported human infection cases, but I have excluded them from this analysis due to case threshold. the WHO site. By 2008, the gap had narrowed to one official report that was either not sent on to the WHO, or the WHO opted not to publish on the DON site. Notably, in the light of the discussion in the previous section, this was in the same year that the Indonesian government -which accounts for the majority of cases in that year -discussed withholding reports. In sum, reports to the WHO were regular -both before the IHR coming into force and afterwards -and states always outpaced the WHO in their official reports of cases. There was only two instances (on 6 January 2005 and 16 June 2005) when the WHO reported on its DON site H5N1 outbreaks not yet confirmed by the state -Vietnam. Moreover, it appears that the mid-2007 date for when the IHR revisions came into force did not have any discernible effect on reporting, suggesting that the duty to report was in play before the IHR coming into formal effect. A second important finding is that those states critiqued for possible noncompliance with their duty to report -China, Indonesia and Thailand -were found to be reporting regularly. Of course, there are attendant questions surrounding the validity of the data and what it is actually telling us. Most notably, are states pre-empting media releases or controlling them (Davies, 2012) ? This is obviously very difficult to measure, but the possibility that reporting is largely controlled by the state should not be excluded. Nonetheless, it appears that the international attention attached to H5N1 cases led to a concerted effort by states to be seen as on the frontlines in response (Coker et al, 2011) .\", \"The third important finding was the variation of state reporting behaviour beyond the graphs shown here. There were several important inconsistencies. Whereas Cambodia, China and Thailand released official reports that closely correlated with the WHO's confirmation of received reports from these countries (variation was no more than one case difference), Indonesia and Vietnam showed variation at different times. Indonesia had a strong reporting relationship with the WHO during the early phase of the outbreak. From 2007, variation started to emerge. In 2007, 5 reports were not passed on to WHO (or not reported), in 2008 there were 3, in 2009 there were 4 and then in 2010 there were 4 government reports that were again not published on WHO site. Both the WHO Office in Indonesia (who reports cases to the WHO Headquarters) and the Indonesian Health Ministry have argued that these discrepancies between what the Indonesian government was reporting and WHO site was listing as confirmed outbreaks was a product of the WHO Headquarters being informed but choosing not to publish the information (Interview, 2011c). A less official line expressed in a separate interview was that the WHO Office staff in Indonesia, during the public dispute with Dr Supari from 2006-2009 and prior to her stepping down, were always promptly informed but requested from 2008 that the WHO Headquarters not immediately publish all outbreak events online (Interview, 2011d) . What is remarkable about this less official explanation is that the Indonesian Health Ministry officials still sought to inform the WHO of outbreaks (possibly without the Health Minister's permission), even during the height of the dispute, and the Ministry officials appeared to trust the WHO officials sufficiently to continue reporting information it did not want publicized.\", \"In the case of Vietnam, viewed as a 'positive' reporting case, the earlier phase of reporting from the government to the WHO was more sporadic -more than even at the height of the 'dispute' between Indonesia and the WHO. In 2005, the government reported 21 cases but the WHO issued only 12 reports. As noted earlier, two of these 12 reports were issued by the WHO without first confirming their existence from the government. From 2007 onwards, the correlation between the WHO and the government reports is almost identical, with only a difference of one case in some years. What is also very interesting about the Indonesia and Vietnam cases has been the strong emphasis in the literature that Indonesia's behaviour is a 'soverignty' or 'securitization' backlash; while Vietnam has been acquiesant. These findings reveal that even at the height of dispute between the WHO and Indonesian government reporting remained strong in comparison to the relationship between the WHO and Vietnam (viewed for the most part in positive terms). Despite significant differences between what Vietnam was obviously experiencing but not communicating to the WHO in the earlier years of the outbreak, there was little suspicion attached to this country's motivations. Whereas, the honesty of the Indonesian government was questioned, it seems, solely on the statements of the Health Minister in 2008. The lack of concern about Vietnam is all the more interesting given that the country's lack of freedom of the press means, in contrast with Indonesia's freer media structures, that there is little in the way of an informal reporting structure to keep the government 'accountable' (for example, Vu, 2010; Interview, 2011b; Davies 2012 ).\", \"In the aftermath of SARS and the IHR (2005) revisions, the WHO Headquarters argued in the 2007 World Health Report that 'in an electronically transparent world where outbreaks are particularly newsworthy events, their concealment is no longer a viable option for governments' (WHO, 2007, p. 13) . In relation to the H5N1 human-to-human infections, which began in late 2003, it was argued that early behaviour indicated that states were willing to confirm outbreak reports and even report outbreaks themselves to the WHO -indicating a high level of norm internalization (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) . However, the virus sharing disagreement between Indonesia and the WHO Headquarters, the comments of Dr Supari and then the variations in reporting time frames (Enemark, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Elbe, 2010; Fidler, 2010b; Smith, 2010; Smith, 2012) prompted concern that statements such as the above by the WHO in their 2007 World Report were overly optimistic.\", \"The question less explored in the literature is whether the normative expectation that states would report outbreaks promptly and transparently, as called for by the WHO, has actually been translated into behaviour. In this article, I have sought to show that for the case of H5N1 -notable for its immediacy post SARS and before the IHR revisions formally came into force -states in East Asia did appear to behave as if they believed themselves to be duty-bound to report promptly. Even those states that complained loudest about the WHO (Headquarters) assertiveness tended to report diseases regularly and promptly. When there were discrepancies (for example, Indonesia and Vietnam), they are minimal when their reporting pattern is viewed over the volume of cases across the six years. This section will now briefly examine how this compliance might be explained in the context of the post-Westphalian versus Westphalian argument.\", \"Constructivist IR theory has traditionally understood the process by which norms shapes behaviour as one of 'norm diffusion' involving 'adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea' (Acharya, 2004, p. 251) . However, as the field's critique of global health governance has noted, neither the East Asian region nor the international community appear to have bought wholesale into the idea that in every instance the IHR must be obeyed, especially if at the expense of other national interests (Katz and Fischer, 2010) . A more nuanced analysis is therefore called for. Amitav Acharya argues that when tracing normative change we should not just stop at the point that the norm is collectively accepted but should consider how the norm is 'localized'.\", \"According to Acharya (2009, p. 19) , norm localization 'does not extinguish the cognitive prior or identity of the norm-takers but leads to its mutual inflection with external norms. In constructivist perspectives on socialization, norm diffusion is the result of adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea. Localization, by contrast, describes a process in which external ideas are adapted to meet local practices'. The trajectory for localization, according to Acharya, progresses in four stages (Table 3) .\", \"What my findings have revealed is that given the conformity to the reporting norm during the H5N1 outbreak in East Asia, the duty to promptly report Table 3 : Trajectory of localization (based on Acharya, 2004, p. 251) Prelocalization\", \"Local actors may at first resist an external norm -either due to doubts of utility, adaptability or that it might undermine existing beliefs and practices. Therefore, it is vital that some aspect of the existing norm is found to have not adequately met 'new and unforeseen challenges'\", \"Local initiative At this stage, some local actors will start to borrow and frame the external norm to suit the local audience. Local actors must be 'willing and credible' -they cannot be seen as representing the wishes of an outside force Adaptation External norm will be 'reconstructed' to fit local beliefs and practices and likewise, local beliefs and practices will be adjusted to the behaviour required of the external norm Amplification Finally, there are new instruments and practices developed from the 'syncretic normative framework' -where local practices and influences are still visible, but the presence of the external norm is now visible disease outbreaks is best understood as being at the 'local initiative' stage where local actors are 'willing and credible' participants in the disease reporting framework but the process of adaptation and amplification are still nascent. Sovereignty has not been evoked to deny the duty to report nor has it led to states abrogating their perceived duty. Instead, East Asian states have demonstrated a strong interest in being seen as competent handlers of the outbreak, partly because of external funding attached to pandemic response and partly because of political interest in responding to an outbreak that was crippling poultry industries around the region (Coker et al, 2011) . Meanwhile, China was later commended for being remarkably cooperative in reporting H5N1 cases to the WHO, many think precisely because of its embarrassment after SARS (Interview, 2010; Interview, 2011a) . This is consistent with Acharya's local initiative stage where states are cognizant of local expectations regarding handling of outbreak events as much as they are of the international community's demands and norms (Harrington, 2010; Elbe, 2010) .\", \"However, as Figure 3 and my third point regarding state reporting behaviour above point out, there were inconsistencies. The question is whether these inconsistencies illustrate a failure to reconstruct the external norm, resulting in reassertions of sovereignty, or whether they were simply products of states interpreting the norm and adapting it to their context and circumstance (Davies, 2011) . For instance, Dr Supari's comments and actions regarding virus sharing did not alter the actual reporting relationship between the WHO Headquarters and Indonesian Health Ministry. Even though Figure 3 appears to show the Indonesian government not passing its reports on to the WHO, we know from reports that outbreak information was shared (Reuters, 2008) . Interviews with key stakeholders from the Indonesian government, the WHO Office in Jakarta and the WHO Headquarters (Interview, 2008; Interview, 2011a; Interview, 2011c; Interview, 2011d) 9 have confirmed that officials-level practice of reporting and verifying was not affected by the political debates about virus sharing and reporting. Political sensitivity amended how the reports were communicated, but the reporting relationship remained intact. The 'international' duty to report was amended to reflect local needs and priorities, but it was not breached. The same explanation has been expressed regarding earlier discrepancies between Vietnam's official reports and the WHO's reports of H5N1 (Interview, 2011b). Moreover, in the case of Vietnam and Indonesia, some delays in reporting appeared to be largely rooted in difficulty communicating outbreaks via decentralized health channels and poorly equipped laboratories outside of capitals (Forster, 2010; Vu, 2010) . It is of note that IR appreciations of the H5N1 case have emphasized sovereign obfuscation over sovereign capacity to meet the duty to report for explaining state behaviour during H5N1 (Davies, 2011) .\", \"Do these findings suggest that the post-Westphalians were right all along? Not yet. While the graphs demonstrate that the desire to internalize the norm to report promptly and openly is evident in the region, if we understand Archya's argument concerning how norms are localized -particularly in the Asian context -there are crucial adaption and syncretic hurdles to be jumped. In other words, the way in which this duty is interpreted and implemented will depend on how it is affected by resource constraints, political systems, political instabilities, natural disasters and crises, and other cherished principles. All of this creates the potential for backtracking when circumstances persuade states that non-compliance would serve them better than compliance. These circumstances were apparent during the course of the H5N1 outbreak but more often than not the duty to report was fulfilled, if imperfectly.\", \"The H5N1 crisis showed that states acted as if they had a duty to promptly report disease outbreaks. Sovereignty was not employed as an excuse to avoid compliance by failing to report. As noted by one health official, 'we are a competitive group in ASEAN, if we can't be seen to be doing the right thing in front of our neighbours y that is worse than anything WHO can say' (Interview, 2011e). Amitav Acharya (2009, p. 5) has noted in the case of Asia, 'new international norms do not enter into a local normative vacuum'. Sometimes new norms can amplify local norms or be made to fit local norms with some form of normative compromise. This normative compromise is evident in the region in relation to the duty to report. Of course, in East Asia, sovereignty and non-interference remain sacrosanct, but the way in which these principles are understood is changing to permit some degree of sovereign responsibility (Bellamy and Davies, 2009 ). Moreover, sovereignty and noninterference have never meant that member states do not need to be aware of the impact of their domestic political actions on each other (Acharya, 2009) .\", \"The response to H5N1 may therefore have been as much about responding to regional demands for notification as it was to responding to the WHO's demands. One example of this that is having great success in the region but receives little discussion within IR circles has been the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) that is now in its second phase (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The purpose of APSED, which includes member states to the WHO South East Asia Regional Office and the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, with the engagement of the ASEAN Secretariat, is to promote regional understandings and interpretation of the IHR revisions, regional understandings of how responsible states engage in disease outbreak surveillance, response and communication (Li and Kasai, 2011) .\", \"In sum, claims that there has been a sovereignty backlash against the duty to report diseases and that this is forestalling progress on global health governance only reflect part of the picture. Of course, sovereignty and politics play important roles but it is important to understand the extent to which behaviour is actually shaped and to do so on the basis of empirical evidence of what that behaviour actually is. Evidence from H5N1 suggests that concerns notwithstanding East Asian states do behave as if they believe themselves to have a duty to report. The source of this change is most probably a combination of global norms, institutional standard setting, self-interest and -importantlyregional peer pressure.\", \"human-to-human transfer cluster (eight cases, seven deaths) and has been linked to the first dispute between the WHO and the Indonesian government regarding release of the virus sequence data (Roos, 2008; Sipress, 2009, pp. 38, 126) 5 Dr Supari was reported as questioning whether the 24-hour requirement of the IHR (2005) was necessary and that she would prefer to provide reports every 6 months (Branswell, 2008) . 6 www.promedmail.org/ 7 www.who.int/csr/don/en/ 8 PMM reporting accuracy has been measured at 91 per cent (Freifeld et al, 2008, p. 150) . 9 Citations are in not order of who was interviewed.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149110/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7123816\",\n  doi: \"10.1007/978-3-319-39141-0_9\",\n  title: \"The Perioperative Use of Albumin\",\n  doc_date: \"2016-06-23\",\n  authors: [\"Ehab.Farag\", \"Andrea.Kurz\", \"Ehab.Farag\", \"Zeyd.Ebrahim\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Key Points\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Albumin Gene and Structure\", \"Albumin Gene and Structure\", \"Albumin and Its Role in Endothelial Barrier\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Albumin as a Major Antioxidant\", \"Anticoagulant Effect\", \"Enzymatic Properties of HSA\", \"Hypoalbuminemia\", \"Hypoalbuminemia\", \"Human Serum Albumin Metabolism\", \"Human Serum Albumin Metabolism\", \"Human Serum Albumin Metabolism\", \"Human Serum Albumin Metabolism\", \"The Use of Albumin in Sepsis ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"The Use of Albumin in Sepsis ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"The Use of Albumin in Sepsis ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"The Use of Albumin in Sepsis ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"The Use of Albumin in Sepsis ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin as a Neuroprotective Agent in Animal Experiments and Clinical Settings ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin as a Neuroprotective Agent in Animal Experiments and Clinical Settings ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin as a Neuroprotective Agent in Animal Experiments and Clinical Settings ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin as a Neuroprotective Agent in Animal Experiments and Clinical Settings ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin as a Neuroprotective Agent in Animal Experiments and Clinical Settings ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin Use in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin and Cardiac Surgery ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin and Cardiac Surgery ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin and Cardiac Surgery ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin and Cardiac Surgery ::: The Use of Albumin in Perioperative Settings\", \"Albumin Solutions\", \"Albumin Solutions\", \"Albumin Solutions\", \"Albumin Solutions\", \"Conclusion\"],\n      generic: [\"method\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"\\nHuman serum albumin is the most abundant protein in the body.Human serum albumin represents the most important antioxidant agent in the human plasma.Human serum albumin is the main depot for nitric oxide transport in the blood.Human serum albumin plays a very important role in maintaining the integrity of vascular barrier and endothelial glycocalyx.Human serum albumin is successfully used in many settings of perioperative medicine.\\n\", \"Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant protein in the human plasma (40–50 g/L). HSA has many functions; it is the main regulator of the vascular barrier, antioxidant in the plasma, and transporter of nitric oxide (NO) and fatty acids and drugs.\", \"HSA infusions have been used successfully for more than 50 years since World War II in many perioperative settings such as shock, volume expansion, burns, cardiopulmonary bypass, acute liver failure, sepsis, and many more. Recently, its use has been questioned following a widely publicized meta-analysis in 1998 that reported increased mortality in patients who received albumin solutions; the role of albumin administration in critically ill patients became highly controversial. However, the results of this meta-analysis have been challenged by several meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials that not only proved the safety of HSA but its benefit especially in patients with sepsis, liver failure, hypoalbuminemia, and burns [1–4]. The most recent evidence-based functions and uses of HSA in the perioperative settings are reviewed in this chapter.\", \"Human serum albumin (HSA) is a non-glycosylated, negatively charged plasma protein. HSA is a single polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 66.5 KDa. HSA consists of α(alpha)-helix but no β(beta)-sheet, and it consists of three homologous domains (I–III) that assemble to form a heart-shaped molecule. Each domain is composed of two subdomains (A & B) with distinct helical folding patterns connected by flexible loops. The center of the molecule is made up of hydrophobic radicals, which are binding sites for many ligands, while the outer part of the molecule is composed of hydrophilic ligands (Fig. 9.1) [5].\\n\", \"HSA is a member of the albumin superfamily, which also includes α(alpha)-fetoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein, and afamin (α[alpha]albumin). HSA synthesis is governed by a single copy gene lying on the long arm of chromosome 4, near the centromere for the long arm, at position 4q11-13. The mRNA for HSA encodes a precursor protein (preproalbumin) of 609 amino acid residues. Cleavage of the single peptide of 18 residues and the propeptide (proalbumin) of six residues yields the mature protein of 585 residues [6].\", \"HSA plays an integral role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular barrier. HSA enhances the integrity by electrostatic binding to the negatively charged heparin sulfate side chains of core glycoproteins such as syndecan-1 and glypican-1 of the endothelial glycocalyx via its positively charged arginine residues and enhances the availability of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by red blood cells (RBCs). Extracellular sphingosine is taken up and phosphorylated by RBCs sphingosine kinases (SK) into S1P that is stored in the cell membrane of RBC. S1P is extracted from the RBC membrane by Apo lipoprotein M (ApoM) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Apo lipoprotein M is the principal partner of S1P in HDL) and HSA, and this ensures a constant supply of receptor-available S1P for cellular signaling purposes. In contrast to the bond formed between S1P and HDL, HSA facilitates the solubility of S1P in the aqueous solution but not in physical bond to HSA. This unbound S1P is the active form of S1P. It is worth mentioning that one S1P molecule is extracted by 500 serum albumin molecules, indicating that HSA does not physically bind S1P [7–9]. S1P activates the G protein-coupled S1P1 receptor, which rapidly activates the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 in the endothelial cells, leading to peripheral localization of cytoskeletal effectors (cortactin and nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase). This localization promotes adherents’ junction (including vascular endothelial-cadherin and associated catenins) and tight junction (occluding, zonula occludens proteins and claudins) formation. Therefore, S1P improves the vascular barrier and stabilizes the endothelial glycocalyx. S1P has been found to reduce matrix metalloproteinase activation, thereby attenuating the loss of endothelial cell surface glycocalyx components. Both actions appear to involve signaling via the S1P receptor [10].\", \"Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance leading to damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. According to Halliwell and Whiteman, an antioxidant is a substance that, when present at low concentrations compared with those of an oxidizable substrate, significantly delays or prevents oxidation of that substrate [11]. Human serum albumin represents a major antioxidant agent in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of HAS results from the redox properties of the Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) and from metal-binding abilities. Among the metal ligands, copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are very important, as they are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) after a reaction with oxygen. Free Cu (I) and Fe (II) ions can react with H2O2 leading to the formation of the deleterious hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Cu(I) and Fe(II) binding to HSA promotes their oxidation to Cu(II) and Fe (III), thereby limiting their ability to participate in Fenton reaction. Copper ions bind to HSA with high affinity at the N-terminal tripeptide Asp-Ala-His. The first four amino acids of the N-terminus of HSA, Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK), form a tight binding site for Cu(II) ions. DAHK/Cu has a superoxide dismutase activity, which thereby reduces the ROS generation. By trapping Cu(II), HSA prevents low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid peroxidation. Moreover, HSA and the tetrapeptide (DAHK) were shown to prevent neuronal death in murine cell cultures exposed to oxidative stress generated by H2O2/Cu(I)/ascorbic acid reagent [12]. Therefore, the binding of Cu ions with albumin is considered one of the most important antioxidant functions of albumin as Cu can react with H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals 60 times faster than Fe.\", \"HSA is important for heme-Fe scavenging, providing protection against free heme-Fe oxidative damage. During the first seconds after heme-Fe appearance in plasma, more than 80 % of this powerful oxidizer binds to HDL and LDL, and only the remaining 20 % binds to HSA and hemopexin (HPX). Then, HSA and HPX remove most of the heme-Fe from HDL and LDL. Afterward, heme-Fe transits from HSA to HPX, which releases it into hepatic parenchymal cells after internalization of the HPX-heme-Fe complex by CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. It should be mentioned that kinetics of heme-Fe transfer from HDL and LDL to HSA and HPX is faster than the heme-Fe-induced lipoprotein oxidation [13, 14].\", \"Albumin-bound bilirubin confers an antioxidant effect by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Bilirubin bound to albumin was shown to protect α(alpha)-tocopherol from damage mediated by peroxyl radicals and to prolong the survival of human ventricular myocytes against in situ–generated oxidative stress [15, 16]. Cholesterol undergoes oxidation in vitro and in vivo, forming biologically active derivatives known as oxysterols. Oxysterols bind to albumin with high affinity. Oxysterols carried by albumin are less rapidly released to cells than cholesterol. By this, albumin could limit detrimental effects of oxysterols on cells. Furthermore, binding homocysteine by HSA protects from atherosclerosis as elevated plasma homocysteine is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) [17].\\n\\n\", \"Physiologically, HAS exists predominately in a reduced form (i.e., with free thiol, HSA-SH) and is known as mercapto-albumin. However, a small but significant proportion of albumin pool exists as mixed disulfides (HSA-S-S-R); where R represents low-molecular-weight, thiol-containing substances in plasma – chiefly cysteine and glutathione [18]. Mixed disulfide formation increases as part of the aging process and during disease processes characterized by oxidative stress that enhances endothelial cell damage through oxidative stress and increase in apoptosis levels. Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) represents the largest fraction of free thiol in human plasma, HAS being the most abundant protein in plasma. Cys34 is located at the surface of HAS, close to Aspartate 38 (Asp38), Histidine 39 (His39), and Tyrosine 84 (Tyr 84). These three residues affect the ionization state of Cys34, thus modulating its reactivity [13]. In healthy adults, about 70–80 % of the Cys34 in albumin contains a free sulfhydryl group, whereas about 25–30 % of the HSA molecules have Cys34 forming a mixed disulfide with either cysteine or homocysteine or glutathione, thus affecting the Cys34 redox potential. Oxidation of Cys34 leads to the formation of sulfenic acid (RSOH), which is further oxidized to sulfinic (RSO2 H) or sulfonic acid form (RSO3 H). Sulfenic acid constitutes a central intermediate in both the reversible and irreversible redox modulation by reactive species. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) constitute nitrogen-centered species analogous to ROS. RNS such as nitric acid (NO) contribute to various biological processes. HSA acts as a NO depot and a NO transducer. Moreover, 82 % of NO in blood (~7 μ[mu] M) is transported as an S-nitrosothiol bound at the HSA residue Cys34. S-nitrosylated HSA may represent a circulating endogenous reservoir of NO and may act as an NO donor. S-nitrosylated HSA acts primarily as a vasodilator in vivo and represents a stable reservoir of NO that can be released when the concentrations of low-molecular-weight thiols are elevated [19]. S-nitrosylated HSA has been shown to reduce either ischemia or reperfusion injury in pig and rabbit hearts after unprotected warm ischemia through long-lasting release of NO [13]. Other RNS, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−), constitute powerful oxidants and nitrating species [20]. The -SH group of albumin represents an important antioxidant against peroxynitrite as the thiol group was oxidized to a sulfenic acid (HSA-SOH). Subsequently, HSA-SOH can be converted to a disulfide and then back to mercapto-albumin (HSA-SH). HSA administration favorably influences plasma thiol-dependent antioxidant status, as well as levels of protein oxidative damage in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21, 22]. Moreover, HSA is able to scavenge strongly oxidant compounds such as hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypothiocyanous acid. Cys34 is oxidized preferentially by hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acid with the corresponding sulfenyl derivative. HSA is able to scavenge HOCI, preventing alteration of its preferential biological target α(alpha)1-antiprotease [23]. Interestingly, West Nile virus is neutralized by hypochlorous acid-modified HSA that binds to domain III of the viral envelope protein E [24].\", \"During its long life (~3 weeks), an HSA molecule makes 15,000 passes through the circulation, incurring some damages that affect its ligand-binding and antioxidant properties. Diabetes mellitus is one of the main pathological conditions that impairs the antioxidant functions of albumin. In this disease, albumin undergoes increased glycation. The level of glycated HSA in normal humans is about 10 %, and increased to 20–30 % in hyperglycemic patients. Glycation corresponds to the nonenzymatic attachment of glucose molecule to a free amine residue. HSA glycation is associated with oxidation of His and Trp residues, main chain fragmentation, and loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. Both the use of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin reduces the levels of advanced glycation [25]. The glycation of HSA impairs its antioxidant activity and its copper-binding ability. Glycation of HSA induced a marked loss of its antioxidant activity to copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, probably by the generation of superoxide. Moreover, the Fe(III)-binding antioxidant capacity of HSA is markedly reduced in diabetic patients. Finally, the HSA transport of tryptophan (Trp), which is the largest and essential amino acid, is reduced after its glycation. HSA glycation alters the binding of endogenous and exogenous ligands; in particular, glycation of Lys 199 enhances warfarin binding, but decreases bilirubin affinity [13].\", \"Several receptors for advanced glycation end products initiate intracellular signaling and enhance ROS formation in the cells through recognition and binding of glycated (macro) molecules including HSA. Moreover, hypochlorous acid-mediated carbonylation of Lys residues of glycated HSA represents a major antigenic advanced glycation end product in hyperglycemia and in inflammation [26]. Glycated albumin was shown to impair vascular endothelial NO synthase activity in vivo in aortas of rabbits [27]. Glycated HSA displays a toxic effect on microglial cells associated with impairments in cellular proteolytic systems, possibly reflecting the role of advanced glycation end products in neurodegenation.\", \"HSA may protect other proteins including hemoglobin, insulin, and immunoglobin from glycation in the early stages of diabetes due to its long half-life and its high concentrations compared to other proteins [28]. The irreversible damages associated with diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and coronary artery disease could be attributed to reduced antioxidant properties of glycated HSA.\", \"Alterations in antioxidant properties of HSA were very recently identified in vivo in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This reflects the impaired antioxidant HSA activity, which is associated with the enhanced glycation level of HSA in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. That might have increased the perioperative risks in those patients [29].\", \"HSA has anticoagulant and antithrombotic functions. These functions may in part be mediated by the HSA capacity to bind NO forming S-nitrosothiols, thereby inhibiting the rapid inactivation of NO and allowing prolongation of its anti-aggregatory effects on platelets [30]. Therefore, the use of HSA might be very beneficial in cases with hypercoagulable conditions such as during the perioperative period.\", \"The interaction between HSA and another molecule results in enzymatic activity. This property of HSA is called an enzyme-like or a pseudo-enzymatic activity. The esterase activity involving lysine (Lys) 199 is able to split acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) into salicylic acid, which is released and the acetyl group is transferred to especially Lys 199. Therefore, aspirin but not other salicylates induce the aspirin resistance syndrome, as the acetylation of albumin molecule can be allergic. Asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps characterize aspirin resistance syndrome. Moreover, Lys 199 and penicillins can covalently bind via an aminolysis, generating a penicilloyl-containing peptide. The covalent labeling of Lys 199 can have clinical consequences. The penicilloyl-HSA complex has no antibacterial activity; however, it represents the major antigenic determinant of penicillin allergy. HSA acts as a phosphotriesterase activity, which thereby inactivates organophosphorus compounds. HSA can catalyze RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage; therefore, it participates in the degradation of endogenous extracellular RNA and of circulating pathogenic nucleic acids. HSA possesses enolase activity toward dihydrotestosterone, converting it from the 3-keto to the 3-enol form. In addition, HSA facilitates the isomerization and the stereoselective hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates and the removal of glucuronide conjugates, thereby reducing their plasma levels by reversible and/or irreversible binding. Finally, HSA seems to have a significant role in both the biosynthesis and the elimination the prostaglandins. HSA has no enzymatic effects on leukotrienes or thromboxanes. However, it binds and thereby stabilizes thromboxane A2. Binding could play a major role for the inactivation of these potent compounds, diminishing the biological activities of substances that may be harmful for the body if present in too large amounts [6, 13].\", \"Hypoalbuminemia is generally defined as serum albumin concentration ≤30 g/L and is usually very common in critically ill patients. The albuminemia could result from increased loss of HSA into the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and reduced hepatic synthesis of HSA caused by cytokines and stress of critical illness.\", \"Hypoalbuminemia is considered an independent risk factor for worse outcomes in critically ill patients. HSA levels <20 g/L were associated with higher mortality risk in burn patients with 84 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity [31]. In surgical septic patients, every 1 g/L decrease in albumin below 23 g/L was associated with a 19.4 % increase in hospital mortality and 28.7 % increase in the incidence of multiple organ failure [32]. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/L in serum albumin was associated with a 137 % increase in morbidity, and a 71 % increase in length of hospital stay [33]. Preoperative low serum albumin (<4.0 g/dl) was shown to be an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) following off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB). AKI was associated with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital and a high mortality rate [34].\", \"HSA circulates from the blood across the capillary wall into the interstitial compartments, including cerebrospinal fluid, and returns to the blood through the lymphatic system with a circulation half-life of approximately 16 h. The movement of HSA across the capillary wall is defined as the transcapillary escape rate (5 % per hour), which indicates the percentage of intravascular HSA leaving the intravascular compartment per hour [13]. In its long half-life of ~2–3 weeks, 1 HSA molecule could make about 15,000 passes through the circulation. HSA is mainly synthesized in the liver. In healthy young adults, about 12–25 g of HSA per day is synthesized in polysomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. HSA is not stored hepatically and there is therefore no reserve for release on demand [30]. Under physiological circumstances, only 20–30 % of hepatocytes produce HSA and its synthesis can be increased up to 200–300 % on demand. HSA synthesis is regulated by colloid osmotic pressure and the osmolality of the interstitial liquid around the hepatocytes. Insulin plays an important role in stimulating HSA synthesis; therefore, diabetic patients could suffer hypoalbuminemia. Estrogens do not affect HSA transcription, but act by modifying the stability of the HSA mRNA. HSA synthesis can be enhanced by corticosteroids, insulin, and amino acids administration. HSA synthesis can be rate-limited by amino acid deficiencies, but these are rarely seen clinically, except in states of extreme starvation and malnutrition [30]. In acute-phase reactions, such as in trauma and the perioperative period, the synthesis of HSA is depressed by hepatic cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α(alpha).\", \"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin, despite their disparate forms and functions, have long been known to share two unique characteristics, namely, their lengthy life spans and inverse relationship between their serum concentrations and half-lives. The long half-lives are attributed to the efficient receptor-mediated recycling pathway involving the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is a heterodimer of a nonclassical major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) α(alpha)-chain and β(beta)2 microglobulin (β[beta]2m) that binds the two abundant serum proteins IgG and albumin in the body. FcRn binds both IgG and albumin simultaneously on the opposite sides of the receptor, where the net transport can be basolateral to apical, apical to basolateral, or apical to apical (endothelial cells). FcRn interacts with IgG and albumin in a strictly pH-dependent manner; therefore, it binds them at acidic pH and not at physiological pH. Pinocytosed IgG and albumin bound by the receptor within acidified endosomes are transported back to the cell surface where physiological pH of the blood triggers release of the ligands into the blood circulation. The intracellular nonbound fractions are targeted for lysosomal degradation. FcRn is also largely responsible for transporting the IgG across the placenta whereby the IgG concentration in newborns at term normally exceeds that of the mother. Animals deficient in FcRn catabolize IgG and albumin more rapidly than normal animals and manifest low plasma concentrations of both molecules. Familial hypercatabolic hyoproteinemia, where deficiency of FcRn is due to mutation in β (beta) 2m results in hypercatabolism and low plasma concentrations of both albumin and IgG. However, patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) exhibit plasma deficiency only in IgG but not albumin caused by reduced affinity of FcRn to IgG [35–37].\", \"The catabolism of HSA takes place in several organs at a rate of about 14 g per day in a 70 kg healthy adult, or 4 % of whole body protein turnover. The rate of HAS catabolism is increased by protein and caloric deprivation as HSA is used as a source of energy. The mechanism of HSA breakdown involves protein uptake into endocytotic vesicles, which fuse with lysosomes of endothelial cells.\", \"Circulating HSA is also lost into the intestinal tract (about 1 g each day), where digestion releases amino acids and peptides that are reabsorbed. There is minimal urinary loss of HSA in healthy subjects. It is worth mentioning that of the 70 kg of HSA that passes through the kidneys each day, only a few milligrams are secreted from kidney tubules [13].\", \"The use of human albumin in critically ill and septic patients has been through much controversy in the last two decades. In 1998, a Cochrane meta-analysis for albumin administration in critically ill patients was published in the British Medical Journal [38]. The average sample size of the selected 32 studies in this meta-analysis was just 46 patients. The results of this meta-analysis showed increased mortality of almost 70 % in patients given albumin. The results of this Cochrane report changed the practice rapidly around the world with dramatic reduction in albumin use especially in Europe. The validity of this meta-analysis has been disputed for several methodological reasons, such as omission of relevant trials, small trials bias, and combination of heterogeneous trials, which included adults and high-risk neonates, inadequate assessment of the effect of methodological quality on outcome, and the absence of a plausible mechanism to explain albumin-associated excess mortality [39, 40]. Moreover, the meta-analysis did not include burns trials in which the mortality rate was lower in albumin [41]. Finally, the crossover pattern in which the most seriously ill patients in the control group were switched to albumin as a rescue measure, therefore, would bias the pooled estimates of relative risk in favor of the control group [40]. Only a few years later, this meta-analysis was followed by an updated meta-analysis, in which 55 trials involving 3,504 randomly assigned patients had been included and 525 deaths occurred [40]. Pooled relative risk estimates among trials with blinding and those with 100 or more patients were 0.73 (CI, 0.48–1.12) and 0.94 (CI 0.77–1.14), respectively. The relative risk was also consistently less than 1.0 for trials that had two or more of the four attributes indicating higher methodological quality such as blinding, mortality as an endpoint, no crossover, and 100 or more patients. These observations suggest that albumin therapy reduces mortality. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis supported the safety of albumin use in critically ill patients. In 2004, the results of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) randomized control trial (RCT) in 7,000 critically ill patients were published, showing that a 4 % albumin solution was as safe as normal saline as resuscitative fluid in critically ill patients [42]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the SAFE study showed benefit of using albumin in patients with severe sepsis, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death of 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.52–0.97; P = 0.03) for albumin compared with saline. Therefore, the authors concluded that administration of albumin compared to saline did not impair renal function or organ function and may have decreased the risk of death in patients with severe sepsis [1].\", \"Moreover, Guidet and colleagues assessed the cost-effectiveness of albumin, as given in the SAFE study on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, who were admitted to 1 of 35 French ICUs. Based on a presumed 4.6 % reduction in mortality associated with albumin therapy as shown in the SAFE trial, 513 lives were saved among the 11,137 patients included, with an estimated life expectancy for each life saved of 9.8 years. Therefore, the authors suggested that albumin administration was a cost-effective intervention in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [4].\", \"In a subsequent meta-analysis that included 17 studies with randomized 1,977 participants, there were eight studies that included only patients with sepsis and where patients were a subgroup of the study population. The use of albumin for resuscitation of patients with sepsis was associated with a reduced mortality, with the odds ratio of 0.82 % (CI 95 % 0.67–1.0, P = .047) [1]. Caironi and colleagues randomized 1,818 patients with severe sepsis in 100 ICUs to receive either 20 % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a higher mean arterial pressure and lower net fluid balance (P < 0.001). At 28 days the mortality rate was 31.8 % in the albumin group and 32.0 % in the crystalloid group. At 90 days the mortality rate was 41.1 % in the albumin group and 43.6 % in the crystalloid group. However, there was improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock (1,121 patients; 90-day mortality, 43.6 % in the albumin group vs. 49.9 % in the crystalloid group; relative risk 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.77–0.99; P = 0.03) [43]. The results of a recent meta-analysis, which included 14 studies (18,916 patients with sepsis), showed that resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis seems to be associated with reduced mortality [44]. Furthermore, the improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, 3,658 with severe sepsis and 2,180 with septic shock patients were included in the analysis [45]. Compared with crystalloid, a trend toward reduced 90-day mortality was observed in severe sepsis patients resuscitated with albumin (OR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.76–1.01; P = 0.08). However, in septic shock patients the use of albumin for resuscitation significantly decreased 90-day mortality (OR 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.67–0.97; P = 0.03) [45].\", \"Albumin resuscitation in sepsis has a unique feature compared to crystalloid as its effectiveness as a plasma-volume expander does not change in pathophysiological conditions associated with increased microvascular permeability as sepsis. In addition, in severe sepsis the ratio of albumin to crystalloid for equal plasma volume expansion is approximately 1–4.5 [46]. The use of intravenous albumin in addition to antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis reduced the incidence of renal impairment, death, and paracentesis-induced circulatory collapse in comparison with treatment with an antibiotic alone [47, 48]. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of albumin improved oxygenation but did not affect mortality [49].\", \"The only exception for the benefit of using albumin in patients with sepsis was shown in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial as evidenced in increasing mortality with the use of albumin and saline boluses compared to no bolus (control group) in pediatric patients infected with malaria in eastern African countries. The bolus-therapy-induced hypervolemia by albumin and saline boluses in those patients could explain the increased mortality in this study compared to control group [50].\", \"Human serum albumin is a unique pleiotropic protein with neuroprotective properties. Rats received 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and were treated with human albumin or saline after 30 min of recirculation. The cortical blood vessels were examined afterward by laser-Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI). Albumin therapy resulted in significant increases in arteriolar diameter, and reversing stagnation, thrombosis, and corpuscular adherence within cortical venules in the reperfusion phase after focal ischemia [51]. In a rat model of acute ischemic stroke induced by MCAO, rats received 1.25 g/kg intravenously at 2, 3, 4, or 5 h after onset of MCAO. Albumin therapy markedly improved neurological function, and reduced infarction volume and brain swelling [51]. The neuroprotective effects of albumin have been confirmed in a study with permanent MCAO in rats, where albumin treatment led to 48 % increases in cortical perfusion (P < 0.002), but saline in the control group caused no change [51].\", \"Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess the albumin treatment during stroke recovery in rats. Albumin treatment was associated with restoration of fMRI response magnitudes and temporal profiles [52]. Rats underwent subarachnoid hemorrhage by endovascular perforation. Albumin of either 0.63 or 1.25 g/kg was injected immediately after the surgery. Albumin at low-to-moderate doses markedly improves long-term neurobehavioral sequelae after subarachnoid hemorrhage [53].\", \"There are only two large published trials for the use of albumin after acute ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), 422 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 % albumin (2 g [8 ml] per kg; maximum 750 ml) and 419 to receive an equivalent volume of isotonic saline. The primary outcome was favorable, defined as either a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1, or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, or both, at 90 days. The rate of favorable outcome did not differ between the groups. However, the patients in the albumin group had more mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [54]. The reason for the negative outcome of this well-designed study was the high dose of albumin given as a single bolus, which might have induced those unfavorable effects and obscured the neuroprotective effect of albumin.\", \"Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days was tolerated by the patients with SAH without major complications and may be neuroprotective. Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days had lower rates of cerebral vasospasm measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and cerebral infarctions. The main physiological effects of albumin treatment were elevation of the serum albumin concentration and mean arterial blood pressure. In addition, serum albumin remained elevated 7 days after treatment, which might be beneficial throughout the critical period of DCI [55, 56].\", \"The mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of albumin could be explained by its ability to attenuate brain edema and inhibit the endothelia cell apoptosis [57, 58]. Albumin administration may improve microcirculatory blood flow, increase organ perfusion, decrease leukocyte rolling and adherence, and reduce the inflammatory response [59]. Albumin preserves the blood brain barrier (BBB) by abolishing the hyperactivation of metalloproteinases −2 and −9 (MMP-2/9) following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting MMP-2 and MMP-9 are key mediators for the albumin-induced neurovascular protection [53]. Moreover, albumin is considered the major antioxidant agent in the body. Albumin functions as an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) reservoir via binding of its sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine 34 residue with NO to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). It is worth mentioning that 82 % of NO in blood is preserved in stable form as RSNO [13]. Therefore, albumin is able to neutralize the excessive circulating NO so as to prevent the nitro-oxidative stress and, on the other hand, to continue to release NO when the concentrations of low-molecular thiols are elevated. Thereby, albumin via RSNO-adducted NO can relax blood vessels, inhibit platelet aggregation, and increase aortic blood flow [53].\", \"In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline, most probably because the hypo-osmolar (4 %) albumin solution with mean measured osmolarity of 266 (266–267) mOsm/kg H2O used in the study induced increases in intracranial pressure but not the use of albumin per se [60, 61]. However, the use of 4 and 20 % solutions in 93 patients with severe TBI and Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8 in addition to a neutral or to a slightly negative fluid balance was associated with low mortality in those patients [62]. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be hypo-osmolar solutions should not be used in patients with TBI [63].\", \"The activation of systemic inflammatory and hemostatic systems that takes place during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) results in fibrin formation, platelet activation/consumption, and endothelial damage. However, the use of 5 % albumin in priming the CPB machine has many advantages, such as preservation of oncotic pressure, preventing fibrinogen and platelet adhesion, and endothelial glycocalyx protection. In addition, it maintains the vascular barrier competency, prevents interstitial edema, and keeps the integrity of the microcirculation [64].\", \"Oliver et al. compared 5 % albumin priming with fresh frozen plasma (FFP)-based priming in pediatric patients [65]. Patients in the 5 % albumin group had significantly lower administration of blood products. It was shown that using albumin for the priming volume, a dilution of coagulation factors is accepted during CPB. This will lead to less thrombin generation and consumption of coagulation factors and the FFP will be supplemented after protamine administration. However, the use of FFP as a priming solution will result in enhancing the thrombin formation during CPB, thereby more heparin is needed and more consumption of coagulation factors is triggered.\", \"The use of albumin in priming the adult CPB may compete with fibrinogen in the formation of the protein layer coating the circuit and the oxygenator, and the preadsorption of albumin prevents fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. Russell et al. have shown in their meta-analysis that albumin compared with crystalloids as a priming solution exerts a number of beneficial effects, including platelet count and colloid osmotic preservation [66].\", \"The use of albumin in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery has resulted in the preservation in clot formation time and maximum clot firmness. However, the use of low molar hydroxyethyl starch solutions (HES) (6 % 200/0.5 or 130/0.4) resulted in prolongation in clot formation time and reduction in maximum clot firmness [67]. Moreover, the use of old high-molar HES and gelatin solutions correlated with the amount of postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but the use of 4 % albumin solution did not [68]. The same results have been confirmed in a meta-analysis comparing the use of HES solutions with albumin. Hemodynamics were similar in both groups, but the use of albumin decreased blood loss, the amount of blood products transfusions, and the need for reoperation postoperatively [69]. The presence of hypoalbuminemia (cutoff 18 g/L) after cardiac surgery was found to be a better predictor for mortality after cardiac surgery – even better than EUROscore [70]. In a recently published prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the preemptive correction of a low preoperative albumin level by administering HSA in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is associated significant reduction in the incidence of AKI, from 26 % in the control group to 13.7 % in the albumin group. The editorial that accompanied the study has suggested that restoring the target level is associated with reduction in AKI in amplitude greater than that of any known intervention in patients undergoing OPCAB [71, 72].\", \"Edwin Cohn’s development of stable albumin solution during World War II was based on a fractionation scheme, which was rapidly adopted by a number of pharmaceutical companies. The pasteurization technique used in albumin solutions production is very effective in eliminating the risk for viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, the recent introduction of ion exchange chromatography in the production of albumin is very effective in reducing the risk of prion disease transmission by albumin solutions [73]. The use of albumin is considered safe practice; in a study evaluating adverse event reporting between 1998 and 2000, the incidence of all reported serious nonfatal and fatal adverse events was just five per million doses, and no patient death was classified as probably related to albumin administration [74].\", \"Currently available human albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidants prosperities, and capacity to bind drugs [75]. It is noteworthy to mention that cysteine 34 – the most important antioxidant residue in HSA – is oxidized in 23 % of healthy human volunteers versus 54–60 % in commercial preparations [76], which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions [77].\", \"Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20–25 % or 4–5 %. Iso-oncotic preparations of HSA are more effective than crystalloids solutions in maintaining the intravascular volume (>80 % vs. <20 %) [78]. Hypertonic albumin (20–25 %) is used in patients with edema as it avoids excessive sodium and chloride loads [75]. Nevertheless, hypotonic 4 % solutions should not be used in patients with traumatic brain injuries.\", \"The excessive need for the HSA solutions has encouraged its production using recombinant DNA technology in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. HSA molecule structure is quite complicated; with 35 cysteine residues, 34 of them form disulfide bonds. Such complicated structure in this large recombinant protein could be a burden in both protein synthesis and folding system, which could result in the low expression or incorrect folding of recombinant HSA (rHSA). Recently, transgenic rice Oryza sativa has been used successfully as a novel bioreactor to produce sufficient quantities of safe rHSA. However, to establish appropriate impurity removal and detection methods in rHSA manufacturing remains a challenge (Fig. 9.4) [79, 80].\\n\", \"HSA has many physiological and biochemical properties that render its use relevant to many aspects of the disordered vascular and cellular functions. HSA has not yet showed all its secrets, and its benefits can only be realized by conducting clinical trials appropriately powered to relevant clinical endpoints.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123816/\"\n}];\nconst similar_paper_1_2 = [{\n  paper_id: \"PMC7264801\",\n  doi: \"10.1111/cjag.12234\",\n  title: \"Framing consumer food demand responses in a viral pandemic\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-05-28\",\n  authors: [\"John.Cranfield\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"INTRODUCTION\", \"INTRODUCTION\", \"INTRODUCTION\", \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\", \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\", \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\", \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\", \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\", \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\", \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\", \"PRICE EFFECTS\", \"PRICE EFFECTS\", \"SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS\", \"SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS\", \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\", \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\", \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\", \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\", \"CONCLUSION\", \"CONCLUSION\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\", \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\", \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"conclusions\", \"conclusions\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"The COVID‐19 pandemic is an unprecedented episode in the last 100 years of human history. All of Canadian society will feel the impact of this pandemic. Beyond the immediate threat to health, employment, and income, food is one area where we will see an impact across all Canadians. What is more, agents and economic actors across the entirety of our agri‐food supply chains will feel this impact. Given that consumer demand pulls food through these agri‐food supply chains, it is important to understand Canadians’ food demand in the immediacy of the pandemic and related economic downturn, and likely through the shadow of both.\", \"The disruption to society and markets arising from Black Swan events is not new. Examples from the last two decades include the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, the 2003 SARS epidemic, the 2003 North American BSE crisis, various food safety recalls,1To be clear, there is no evidence to suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic is a food safety issue. the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. COVID‐19 is different. It is different because this is a highly contagious virus for which no known and proven vaccine yet exists. It is different because of the economic disruption arising from the shuttering of economic and commercial activity on an almost unparalleled scale. It is different because of the disruption to work, home, and personal routine (e.g., working from home, physical distancing, school closures, closure of non‐essential business, the response by food service and grocery retail sectors). It is different because we are dealing with the concurrence of a viral pandemic and economic downturn. While the response to and impact of past Black Swan events are informative, they cannot help us fully anticipate the impact of the double‐whammy of such a significant viral pandemic and economic downturn.\", \"This paper explores how COVID‐19 could impact consumer demand for food. The paper contains no literature review, no conceptual or empirical model, nor any empirical analysis. It offers some thoughts intended to stimulate discussion (and research). The paper is structured around five areas: the structure of preferences, household budgets, price effects, socioeconomic factors, and consumer behavior. It is important to emphasize that the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand (and shopping behaviors) will differ across the intersection of individual and household experiences, characteristics, and contexts. In understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on demand for food, there is no average effect that carries meaning. Differential impacts and distributional consequences will be profoundly important in understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand.\", \"The structure of preferences will be an important issue in understanding how consumers respond to COVID‐19. I see three immediate areas where the structure of the utility function should reflect the circumstances around COVID‐19. The first concerns what is in a consumer's utility function. Beyond consumption quantities, one might imagine that in light of COVID‐19, the well‐being of others might enter into one's utility function. This gets at whether an individual is making decisions for themselves, or in a way that reflects the wellbeing of others (be they other members of the household, family, or broader society). In this respect, notions of altruism and interdependent utility functions become important. More broadly than this, one could think about incorporating the notions of personal and social capital in the utility function and defining these forms of latent capital as functions of choices made (Becker & Murphy, 2000). The idea here would be that an individual derives utility of services flowing from personal and social capital, while personal and social capital depend on the elements of choice and may well reflect the choice one makes for themselves, others, and conceivably others’ choice.\", \"Second, the temporal nature of choice also needs consideration when thinking about consumer demand for food in a pandemic. The issue is whether food consumption occurs at the time of purchase. Under normal circumstances, most households separate the purchase and consumption decisions, leading to home inventories being held as a matter of convenience. Given changes to the retail grocery landscape (e.g., some stores having reduced hours or limits on the number of people in the store at one time, and transaction costs associated with on‐line purchasing, etc.) it may be that some consumers continue to purchase and store inventories at home as a matter of convenience. It is also possible that some households increase their home inventories to reduce the number of future shopping trips (and thus limiting their perceived risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus).\", \"Purchasing now for later consumption introduces a dynamic inventory problem that reflects a discount rate for the future utility from consumption. This brings into to play two important issues—consumer discount rates and the time horizon in a consumer's mind when deciding how much to buy now for later consumption. I would hazard a guess that the planning horizon is longer in the COVID‐19 environment, and discount rates smaller, thus making future consumption more of a concern, and leading to excess inventory holding. Temporal considerations could also affect what is purchased. Given a longer planning horizon, and potentially lower discount rates, one might expect to see a rise in demand for easily stored food items, and a fall in demand for not easily stored food items or foods whose quality falls with storage. In this respect we might see substitution between the form the underlying food good takes—for instance, substituting between fresh fruit and canned fruit.\", \"Excess inventory holding leads to the third structure of preference issue, namely uncertainty. A longer time horizon and lower discount rates may lead to excess inventory holding compared to pre‐COVID‐19 periods, but so too could risk or uncertainty. In the absence of a definite end to the COVID‐19 pandemic, some may undertake excess in‐home food inventory holding as an insurance against future stockouts at the grocery store—a consumer version of the convenience yield in commodity storage if you will. In this sense, “hoarding” may be a rational response to expected future stockouts, with the cost of excess purchases viewed as a risk premium for informal insurance against grocery store stockouts. If true, then somewhat paradoxically, this form of self‐insurance could lead to behaviors that create a stockout.\", \"While the structure of preferences is important to bear in mind, so too are limits on choice through income and time constraints. Continuance of income/cash flows is important in understanding consumer response to COVID‐19. For those affected by a loss of income, an open and important question is whether and how participation in Canada's Employment Insurance program and the recently announced Canada Emergency Response Benefit impacts their demand for food. Also important is whether and how demand for food changes by those whose incomes are partially supported by their employers accessing the federal government's Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program. On both scores, the potential distribution effects will be important to understand. An individual's capacity to draw on saving or liquid assets, or rely on credit‐based (e.g., credit cards or a line of credit) consumption smoothing, are also important factors to consider, and which carry broader distribution issues insofar as access to credit is concerned.\", \"Demand for food and most food products in Canada tends to be income‐normal. We would expect a proportionally smaller reduction in demand for a food product than the proportional reduction in income/expenditure. Despite this, lessons from the 2008/2009 financial crisis remind us of what we might expect to see—namely, a higher degree of economizing in the food purchasing decision in the face of income/expenditure reductions. This can take varied forms, including eliminating the purchase of foods not deemed essential in the consumers' mind, reduced consumption of some goods, or within‐category substituting away from relatively higher‐priced alternatives. In light of expected income reductions, we might also expect to see a fall in demand for some niche and premium priced food products as people substitute towards value‐priced and non‐niche equivalents. While not related to food, we might also see deferral or postponing of big‐ticket purchases (e.g., vacation, durable goods, etc.) and mortgage/rent deferrals as a way to generate liquidity to support the purchase of necessities. Unlike the 2008/2009 financial crisis, large portions of the foodservice sector have closed or changed their business model in light of COVID‐19—by circumstance, we are seeing fewer Canadians eating out of the home. What we do not know is whether the resulting reduction in household expenditures on services translates into greater liquidity when buying food for consumption in the home. We do not really understand the degree of substitutability between expenditure on food consumed in the home and food consumed out of the home, and especially so during an event like COVID‐19.\", \"The allocation of individual and household time is also changing, and this might impact the demand for food. School closures, the closing of non‐essential businesses, work‐from‐home arrangements, and closing of recreational facilities, churches, and other civic venues, and their programs, means more Canadians are at home. Some have more time available for new uses, while others will have new and competing demands on their time. This new organization of households and decisions concerning an individual's allocation of time could have a bearing on demand for food. On the one hand, I could imagine individuals and households undertaking a more concerted effort to consume food prepared in the home, and which offer potentially enhanced health and nutrition profiles. On the other hand, I can see the new challenges of household organization and individual time use leading to a rise in demand for prepared, heat‐and‐eat food products, as well as meal kits. Both carry an expectation of an increase in demand, but demand for ingredients on the one hand, and convenience foods on the other. What we actually observe will depend on the lifecycle and composition of the home, and the duration of the pandemic and closure of foodservice establishments offering dine‐in options. A longer pandemic might lead some to invest in human capital by learning new food preparation skills that enable them to create meals from base ingredients, rather than relying on prepared foods. But, the time pressure for those working‐from‐home and with children (or other dependents) in the home will be different from those who are not working and/or do not have children (or other dependents) in the home. The opportunity cost of one's time (and within the context of the household) will be very important in understanding how consumer demand for food changes in response to COVID‐19, and in understanding a decision to invest in new food preparation skills.\", \"At the time of writing, we cannot attribute COVID‐19 to widespread, persistent changes in the price of food. While stockouts have occurred, the price impact of these stockouts appears muted by a responsive supply chain. Unlike legislated or regulated rationing and price controls implemented during WWII, we have not seen institutional rationing or price controls outside of preexisting conditions in some regulated agricultural markets. This is not to say that price gouging has not happened in the face of spikes in demand, but we have the ability to protect consumers through established Federal and Provincial consumer protection and emergency legislation. For instance, using the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, the Province of Ontario recently announced new fines and penalties for those found guilty of price gouging. Other means of “policing” pricing behavior also exist—for instance, using social media to publicly shame establishments undertaking such practices, and firms self‐policing their pricing policies as a matter of good public relations and corporate governance.\", \"Supply chain responsiveness is key to the short‐run price stability we have seen thus far. However, longer‐term effects are less clear, especially as the first expected wave of COVID‐19 is accelerating at a time when much of North American agricultural is begin its planting season. We may well see price increases in the future if there are systematic and sustained disruption of distribution channels or agricultural production.2One issue which might be particularly important in Canada in this regard is access to seasonal agricultural workers. Demand for many groups of commodities tends to be price inelastic, meaning the expected proportional impact on demand would be less than the proportional increase in price. As well, given the variety of quality, selection and varying price points in most grocery stores, I would expect the between and intragroup substitutability to be an important part of how consumers economize in the face of relative price increases.\", \"Preferences, prices, and income are important considerations in understanding how demand for food responds during the COVID‐19 crisis. But so too are sociodemographic factors that reflect the lifecycle of the individual and household. This is not to say that sociodemographic factors drive changes in demand; rather, that changes in food demand arising from COVID‐19 may have a differential effect across individuals and households with different characteristics. Ignoring these sociodemographic effects robs us of understanding the deeper insights of how COVID‐19 may affect consumer demand for food in Canada. But what sociodemographic factors do you consider? A variety of observables come to mind: gender and identity, age, education, migrant status, employment status, ability status, and household composition are all important. So too is the intersection of these characteristics insofar as defining broader segments of consumers that might lend itself to insights about common responses across subgroups of the population at similar stages of their lifecycles.\", \"Additional consideration should be given to sociodemographic characteristics which capture those in vulnerable groups. These groups include those who face precarious employment (and income), the homeless, those who face food insecurity, and those who are immune compromised or for whom it would be unwise to leave their homes in light of the COVID‐19 virus. While not at all exhaustive, I hope this underscores the fact that there are groups with precarious socioeconomic status who may be marginalized, and whose food demands may be particularly affected by COVID‐19.\", \"COVID‐19 is affecting where and how people shop, and may well influence what people buy and consume. Weeks into the COVID‐19 pandemic and we are seeing changes in the channel and venue that people use to acquire food. Restaurants are almost universally closed for order‐in or sit‐down service, and those that remain open are doing so with reduced hours, a limited menu selection, and delivery or drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options. This means Canadians have likely reduced their frequency of eating out of the home. Interestingly, restaurants that only offer drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options point to the role of transport and the intersection of access to transport and socioeconomic status. For some, transportation needed to access food may be a limiting factor. Reductions in public transport services in some locales (as a means to limit the risk of exposure to COVID‐19) potentially magnifies this effect. Nonetheless, as mentioned previously, reduced food‐away‐from‐home options could alleviate income effects in that a dollar now spent in a grocery store may go further than a dollar previously spent in a foodservice establishment. Admittedly, this comparison omits a time and skill element; planning and preparing a meal takes time and knowledge—account needs to be taken of the in‐sourced services now provided by the consumer (or in‐home food preparer) that the foodservice establishment provided previously.\", \"Most retail grocery venues remain open but with reduced hours (to give staff a break and allow for restocking) and, in some cases, with limits on the number of people in the store at any given time (as a means of ensuring physical distancing), and limits on how much of an item one may buy at one time. In some locales, farmers' markets have been closed as a means of limiting the risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus, potentially having an impact on buying locally. We have also seen dedicated hours for those in more vulnerable groups at some retail grocery chains. As I mentioned above, we are likely seeing less frequent trips to grocery venues—likely due to heightened concerns of exposure to the COVID‐19, directives by various levels of government, or competing demands on time arising from new home‐based activities (e.g., care of dependents). At the same time, we are seeing a rise in online grocery shopping (Robertson, 2020), and I would expect to see a rise in home meal kits. The timing of online grocery services is an issue, with longer lead times for orders than before the COVID‐19 pandemic, thus requiring more planning and potentially placing greater demands on the time needed for food choice in the household.\", \"I believe it would be a fool's errand to predict changes in demand for a particular food or food group. Too much is changing too fast. But, two observations come to bear in the context of what people are buying. First, we are seeing evidence that the food manufacturing sector is changing their product runs to focus on more basic product forms (Baum & Robertson, 2020). Second, we are seeing a rise in demand for the ingredients used in baking (Strong, 2020). The former might point to market responsiveness in the context of firm's expectation of consumers economizing behavior. The latter might point to Canadians seeking self‐sufficiency in light of the pandemic (i.e., in‐sourcing the preparation of what we otherwise buy in a prepared form, e.g., making bread at home instead of buying it at a store), or an inclination toward foods that bring comfort in a time of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. It will be interesting to see if the demand for foods or food ingredients that contain “comfort” attributes will rise during the pandemic.\", \"Several other issues arise in the context of shopping behavior and what people buy. As it appears some people are stocking up, will there be an unintended rise in food waste related to perishable products, or products which exceed their best before date prior to consumption? Relatedly, how will people use leftovers to make their food dollar go further and potentially limit the number of trips they make to a grocery venue (or limit the number of orders they make online). Lastly, how will changes in consumption behaviors manifest themselves in a movement along an Engel curve (pointing to the greater importance in food expenditure during a recession) and translate into a change in farmer's share of consumer's food dollar?\", \"This paper explores several issues related to the potential impact of COVID‐19 on food demand. It offers casual observation with no analysis. Moving beyond a static, certain approach to the structure of preferences will help us understand observed behavior (e.g., stockpiling) and possibly understanding future behaviors in a COVID‐19 world. Income and time constraints will matter. Tighter incomes will likely lead to substituting behaviors within and between food groups. However, people shifting food expenditures from away‐from‐home to in‐home consumption will temper this effect. New routines forced by work‐from‐home requirements, school closures, and physical distancing will impact the opportunity cost of time and may lead to new food behaviors. Muted short‐run retail food price effects are evident. However, how the agricultural sector fares in light of physical distancing and possible disruptions to agricultural labor markets and production practices lends itself to the possibility of higher food prices in the long run (and possibly increased price volatility). It will be important to understand the impact on food demand arising from policy interventions related to wages and income. This understanding should take account of sociodemographic factors, and the intersection of these factors. Lastly, where and how people shop has and will continue to change as the COVID‐19 pandemic evolves in Canada. Whether these changes persist will depend on the duration of the pandemic and associated economic downturn.\", \"Like all countries, Canada has groups vulnerable to and affected by food insecurity. However, as a nation, Canadians have come to expect an assured supply of food. While recent spikes in demand at the food retail level have led to stockouts, the responsive nature of our food supply chains means these shortages have been short‐lived. Given that COVID‐19 has not led to restrictions on food and agricultural trade, and given the resilient nature of our agricultural sector, I remain optimistic about the continuity of the food supply. Barring significant disruption to agricultural production, my thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will drive most of the changes we will observe in food markets. In this respect, income/expenditure, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons will account for the lion's share of these demand‐side drivers. I hope these musings will stimulate discussion amongst the broader community and lead to empirical analysis that improves our understanding of whether and how a Black Swan event like COVID‐19 affects consumer choice.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.1111/cjag.12234\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC4094370\",\n  doi: \"10.1007/s00705-013-1942-x\",\n  title: \"Molecular detection and genetic characterization of kobuviruses and astroviruses in asymptomatic local pigs in East Africa\",\n  doc_date: \"2013-12-11\",\n  authors: [\"Joshua.Amimo\", \"Edward.Okoth\", \"Joseph.Junga\", \"William.Ogara\", \"Moses.Njahira\", \"Qiuhong.Wang\", \"Anastasia.Vlasova\", \"Linda.Saif\", \"Appolinaire.Djikeng\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Sample collection ::: Materials and methods\", \"RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ::: Materials and methods\", \"RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ::: Materials and methods\", \"Sequencing and molecular analysis ::: Materials and methods\", \"Sequencing and molecular analysis ::: Materials and methods\", \"Incidence of kobuvirus infection ::: Results and discussion\", \"Incidence of kobuvirus infection ::: Results and discussion\", \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\", \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\", \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\", \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of porcine astroviruses ::: Results and discussion\", \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of porcine astroviruses ::: Results and discussion\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"Small-scale pig production (free range or small backyard herds) constitutes >70 % of the total pig farms in East Africa. Pigs in this region often live in close proximity to humans, causing public health concerns and a need for increasing health standards. East Africa is also known for the large population of wild (bush) pigs and warthogs that are in close contact with domestic pigs, creating favorable conditions for intermixing and spread of viral strains. Emerging viruses represent a threat to human and food animal health, as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of influenza and coronavirus infection. Hence, knowledge about the diversity of viruses present in reservoir animals can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. Kobuviruses, which are members of the genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, are small, non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. The genus Kobuvirus includes three officially recognized species: Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B (bovine kobuvirus), and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus) [1]. The kobuvirus genome is approximately 8.3 kb long and is organized into three structural (VP0, VP3 and VP1) and seven non-structural (2A-2C and 3A-3D) regions with a leader protein (L). The 3D gene region encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and represents a region that is conserved among kobuviruses [2]. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the 3D RdRp coding region among porcine kobuvirus, bovine kobuvirus and Aichi virus vary from 74.0 % to 81.0 % [3]. Aichi virus was first detected in Japan in 1989 from a human patient with acute gastroenteritis [4]. Since then, Aichi virus has been detected in Asia, Europe, South America and Tunisia [5–8]. Bovine kobuvirus was first recognized in 2003 as a cytopathic contaminant in cell culture medium derived from bovine serum in Japan. Later, it was found in fecal samples of clinically healthy cattle [9]. Bovine kobuvirus has also been detected in domestic sheep in Hungary [10, 11]. Porcine kobuvirus (S-1-HUN/2007: EU787450) was first identified from fecal samples of domestic pigs in 2008 in Hungary [1]. Thereafter, porcine kobuvirus was reported in additional countries, including Asian countries [12, 13], the Netherlands and Brazil [14], and the USA [15]. The prevalence of kobuvirus infection in pigs ranges from 30 % to 99 %. This large variation could be a result of different ages within the populations evaluated, diarrheal status, regional differences, and other factors. Studies showing association of porcine kobuvirus infection with clinical disease are limited; however, a recent study in Korea found an association between porcine kobuvirus detection and diarrhea in pigs [13]. An association between kobuvirus infection and age has been reported in cattle and in pigs [16].\", \"Astroviruses belong to the family Astroviridae, which consists of two genera: Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus, whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, respectively. Astroviruses are generally associated with either mild or severe enteric disease symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting in a number of mammalian species [17]. Bridger in the UK and Saif et al. [18, 19] in the USA reported the first porcine astroviruses (PAstV) detected in pigs by electron microscopy. Later in 1990, PAstV was isolated in Japan [20]. Recently, Mor and co-workers also reported PAstV in pigs in the USA with a prevalence of 62 % [21]. To date, five PAstV types (PAstV1–PAstV5) have been identified from different countries, including the Czech Republic, Colombia, Canada, the USA, China and Hungary [22–27]. Among the five types, PAstV1, PAstV2 and PAstV3 were identified in fecal samples from healthy pigs.\", \"Epidemiological information on the geographical distribution, incidence and genetic diversity of kobuviruses in African swine populations is not available. In this study, we report the first detection of porcine kobuviruses in samples collected from nursing and weaned pigs in East Africa and analyze the phylogenetic relationships between the East African porcine kobuvirus strains and known kobuvirus strains as well as other representative picornaviruses. This study also reports the first detection of porcine astrovirus in this region.\", \"Accession numbers of nucleotide sequences strains described in this study were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: kobuviruses, KF494340-KF494343 and KF597279; astroviruses, KF597280-KF597282.\", \"A total of 251 fecal samples were obtained from nursing and post-weaning piglets raised in small-scale farms (n = 1 to 25 pigs per farm) with different management systems in western Kenya (n = 140) and eastern Uganda (n = 111). The management system consisted of pigs being housed, housed and tethered, housed and free-range, tethered, tethered and free-range and free-range. The pigs were mostly fed swill from hotels and leftover household food. The sample collection consisted of 41 samples from nursing pigs (less than 4 weeks of age), 90 samples from post-weaning pigs (12 weeks of age) and 120 samples from growers (16 weeks of age). All pigs appeared clinically healthy at the time of sampling. Fresh samples were collected from individual pigs, placed into a sterile specimen container and stored on dry ice before being transported to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) laboratory in Busia, where the samples were stored at −70 °C until use. The samples were then shipped to the BecA-ILRI laboratories in Nairobi for analysis.\", \"Fecal samples were prepared as 10 % (v/v) fecal suspensions in minimum essential medium (MEM). The prepared sample suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1,800×g, 4 °C. RNA was extracted from a 250-μl starting volume of centrifuged 10 % fecal suspensions using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA recovered was suspended in 40 μl of nuclease-free water and stored at −70 °C until used. cDNA was synthesised using a Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific®) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and the cDNA was immediately used for amplification or stored at −20 °C.\", \"Previous studies using the calicivirus primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29] targeting the calicivirus RdRp gene (317 nt for norovirus and 329 nt for sapovirus) also amplified the 3D RdRp regions of porcine kobuvirus (~1100 nt) [15], which was confirmed by sequence analysis of five representative suspect samples in the present report. This same primer pair was used for the detection of porcine kobuviruses from East African pigs. RT-PCR was carried out using Accupower® PCR premix (Bioneer Co, S. Korea) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Accupower® PCR premix is a ready-to-use lyophilized premix of dNTPs, Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, a tracking dye, and a stabilizer. Briefly, in each 20-μl reaction premix tube, 2 μl (5-50 ng) of cDNA template was mixed with 1 μl (10 pMol) each of forward and reverse primers, and 16 μl of nuclease-free water. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C of 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The temperature was then held at 4 °C. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after staining with Gel Red™ nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium, Hayward, CA). When bands were found in the region of 1,100 bp on the agarose gel, we tentatively considered the results kobuvirus positive. The samples with the correct band size were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing. In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the PCR products of three selected samples from three different farms were determined by direct sequencing.\", \"To confirm the RT-PCR results and to obtain genetic information on virus diversity, the partial 3D RdRp amplicons of five kobuvirus-positive samples were sequenced directly using forward (p110) and reverse (p290) primers using BigDye Terminator cycle chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting RdRP gene sequences were edited using Bioedit version 7.1.9 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and compared with sequences of kobuvirus reference strains in the GenBank database by BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequence similarity analysis was performed for the aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Phylogenetic analysis of the East African porcine kobuviruses with kobuvirus reference strains based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments was conducted using the neighbor-joining method supported with a bootstrap test of 1000 replicates in MEGA 5 software [30]. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tamura 3-parameter method and are in units of base substitutions per site.\", \"To analyze porcine kobuvirus infection in pigs of different ages with different management systems, the piglet fecal samples were divided according to the age of the animals into three groups: nursing, ≤1-month-old (n = 47), weaned, (3-month-old, n = 90) and growers (>4-month-old, n = 120). Statistical analysis was performed with SAS® to compare the proportions of kobuvirus-positive samples among the four districts, the two countries, the three age groups evaluated and the six different management systems. The analysis was performed using the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test. The confidence limit for the statistical tests was set at 95 % (P < 0.05).\", \"Kobuvirus RNA was detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the pig fecal samples analyzed using primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29]. Kobuvirus was detected in both Kenya (14.9 %) and Uganda (15.5 %) in equal proportions, and in all four districts sampled (Table 1), an indication of a general circulation and endemicity of the virus on the tested farms. Among the age groups, younger piglets shed more virus than older pigs, and a higher incidence (15 of 90, 16.7 %) of kobuvirus was reported in post-weaning (3-month-old) piglets compared to nursing piglets (6 of 41, 14.6 %) and grower pigs (12 of 120, 10 %). This could possibly be due to an inefficient immune response, diminishing maternal immunity post-weaning, or other intrinsic age-related factors. Higher rates of infection in young piglets has also been reported in other studies [3, 13, 14]. Based on management systems in the study area, confinement of pigs presented a higher risk of kobuvirus infection, with housed pigs shedding more virus than free-ranging pigs (Table 1). This could be the result of viral accumulation in the pig houses or the places where pigs are tethered. Additionally, kobuvirus was more prevalent in the farms with larger herd size (>10 pigs, 20 %) than farms with small herds (<10 pigs, 12.6 %).\\n\", \"The incidence of porcine kobuvirus infection reported in this study (13.1 %) was lower than that reported in other countries, which ranged between 30.1 % in China and 99 % in Thailand [3, 31–33]. A recent study in Korea detected porcine kobuvirus in 84.5 % of diarrheic pigs and 19.3 % of healthy pigs [13]. Similarly, a study in Japan using samples from healthy pigs reported 45.4 % prevalence of porcine kobuvirus [12]. This difference may be attributable to variations in the samples due to factors like sampling time, sampling place (distribution of sampling farms), sample size, age of pigs, and clinical background of the tested animal population (diarrhea or clinically healthy). The association of this agent with enteric diseases in pigs in the study area remains unclear, since we only analyzed samples from asymptomatic pigs, and no data were available from tests for kobuvirus in pigs with gastroenteritis from the same farms; however, some of the positive samples came from farms with a history of diarrhea. This study confirmed that infection with kobuvirus in asymptomatic pigs is common, as has been reported in other studies [14, 32, 34]. Further studies on risk factors for this infection and the association of this virus with gastroenteritis are necessary, especially in developing countries where a majority of pigs are raised in smallholder production systems with varied management.\", \"To gain more information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine kobuvirus strains circulating in swine in the East African farms, five kobuvirus-positive samples were selected, and their partial 3D RdRP region was sequenced. Genetic analysis of the partial sequence revealed that the kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are more variable, sharing nucleotide sequence identity ranging from 89.7 from 99.1 % among them. At the nucleotide and amino acid level, they were 69.4–70.7 % and 70.7–71.9 % identical, respectively, to Aichi virus, 73.1–74.4 % and 78.8–80.5 % to bovine kobuvirus, 70.8-71.9 % and 78.5-79.5 % to kobuvirus in sheep, 67-70.7 % and 67.8-69.1 % to canine kobuviruses and 88-92.3 % and 90.4-97.5 % to other porcine kobuviruses (Table 2).\\n\", \"Phylogenetic analysis of partial 3D RdRp nucleotide and amino acid sequences of porcine kobuvirus strains detected in this study, together with published sequences of kobuvirus reference strains (porcine kobuviruses, aichi viruses and bovine kobuvirus) and representatives of other picornaviruses, revealed that three of the detected strains (Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279) grouped together and formed their own cluster, while one of the strains (K-118-KF494342) clustered with Chinese strains, and another strain (K-460-KF494343) clustered with Korean strains (Fig. 1). This indicates that porcine kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are genetically diverse. Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279 samples were collected in the same geographical location, indicating that porcine kobuviruses in the East African region may be geographically restricted; however, more strains from different parts of East Africa need to be sequenced to ascertain the geographical distribution of this virus. Genetic diversity among geographically separated porcine kobuviruses have been reported in other studies [13].\\n\", \"Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that the five strains detected were more closely related to the kobuviruses, notably porcine kobuvirus, than to any other picornaviruses, and this was supported by the 100 % bootstrap value (Fig. 1). Evidence of a close genetic relationship or interspecies transmission among different viruses in the genus Kobuvirus has been documented. A sheep kobuvirus strain has high nucleotide sequence identity to bovine kobuvirus [10], and one porcine kobuvirus is more closely related to bovine kobuvirus than to porcine strains [12]. However, in this study, we did not find kobuvirus strains that were similar to members of kobuviruses from species other than pigs.\", \"In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific RT-PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the RT-PCR products of three selected samples were determined by direct sequencing, and the result showed that one of the strains (K-268-KF597282) had 86.1 % nt sequence identity to porcine astrovirus type 2 in the RdRp gene. The other two strains (K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281) had 96.7 % identity to porcine astrovirus type 3. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, in which K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281 strains clustered with astrovirus type 3 (PAstV-3-US-MO123-JX556691) detected in the USA, while the K-268-KF597282 strain clustered with astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2/2007/HUN-GU562296) detected in Hungary (Fig. 2). Recent studies in the USA revealed high genetic heterogeneity of PAstV strains [35]. The importance of co-circulation of PAstVs and the role pigs may play in the transmission and recombination of this virus need further investigation.\\n\", \"In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses are present in the swine population in East Africa, and to our knowledge, this study reports the first detection of porcine kobuvirus and astrovirus in this African region and the first molecular analysis of the detected strains. The presence of these gastroenteritis-producing viruses in clinically healthy pigs represents a source of infection of pigs, and possibly to humans, and hence, further studies are required to determine their role in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine their genetic diversity in order to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1942-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24327095/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC5311072\",\n  doi: \"10.3389/fpubh.2017.00020\",\n  title: \"A Blueprint to Evaluate One Health\",\n  doc_date: \"2017-02-16\",\n  authors: [\"Simon.Rüegg\", \"Barry.McMahon\", \"Barbara.Häsler\", \"Roberto.Esposito\", \"Liza.Nielsen\", \"Chinwe.Ifejika Speranza\", \"Timothy.Ehlinger\", \"Marisa.Peyre\", \"Maurizio.Aragrande\", \"Jakob.Zinsstag\", \"Philip.Davies\", \"Andrei.Mihalca\", \"Sandra.Buttigieg\", \"Jonathan.Rushton\", \"Luís.Carmo\", \"Daniele.De Meneghi\", \"Massimo.Canali\", \"Maria.Filippitzi\", \"Flavie.Goutard\", \"Vlatko.Ilieski\", \"Dragan.Milićević\", \"Helen.O’Shea\", \"Miroslav.Radeski\", \"Richard.Kock\", \"Anthony.Staines\", \"Ann.Lindberg\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Introduction\", \"Introduction\", \"Drivers ::: Characterizing OH\", \"Operations ::: Characterizing OH\", \"Supporting Infrastructure ::: Characterizing OH\", \"Outcomes ::: Characterizing OH\", \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\", \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\", \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\", \"The Realization of OH ::: Discussion\", \"Author Contributions\", \"Conflict of Interest Statement\"],\n      generic: [\"introduction\", \"introduction\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"method\", \"related-works\", \"general-terms\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"One Health (OH) positions health professionals as agents for change and provides a platform to both measure and manage determinants of health seldom fully covered by medicine or public health alone. The integration of human, animal, and environmental health has a long history (1–4). Recent financial, economic, social, environmental, and health crises have led to the renewed recognition that collaborative approaches between disciplines are urgently needed (5, 6). The fear of emerging pandemics, as well as climate change, drug resistance, food and water security and safety, has caused a shift from an interdisciplinary approach, whereby experts collaborate across disciplinary boundaries, to a transdisciplinary approach that integrates society and science by including all stakeholders (5, 7, 8). This transcends traditional boundaries, and integrates knowledge and perspectives from scientific and non-scientific sources (9, 10). Many communities involved in health issues have proposed transdisciplinary and systemic approaches with different focuses, such as Ecohealth, Global Health, Planetary Health, or Health in scaled Social–Ecological Systems (7, 8). While there is considerable literature describing what integrated approaches to health could be, there are no recognized guidelines—to our knowledge—on how to evaluate to what extent the underlying integration as a principle and approach contributes to constructive management of complex health problems, such as antibiotic resistance or outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus disease. OH emphasizes the commonalities of human, animal, plant, and environmental health. In this perspective, it can be regarded as an “umbrella” term that captures integrative approaches to health across these highly interlinked components (4, 11). Due to the existing, historically contingent, organization of societies and disciplines, and the sectoral allocation of resources, developing integrated approaches is difficult, and benefits can be delayed. There is thus a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH to governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders (5, 12) and to explore how to evaluate integrated approaches to health. The Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH)1 is an initiative funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology that aims to address this by developing a framework and protocols for the evaluation of OH initiatives and by providing examples of their application.\", \"The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe evaluable characteristics of OH approaches, and to present what they can encompass and achieve. This provides a basis for evaluation of OH initiatives and their outcomes, which could not be achieved using standard, sectoral approaches.\", \"Factors identified as drivers (Figure 1) define the need for change toward OH approaches, based on a collective perception of a given problem. Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15). In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human’s access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16). At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17).\", \"Although OH initiatives can range from development projects to educational programs, research projects, and intergovernmental strategies, they often have specific operating principles, characterized by a way of thinking, planning, and working. We selected this classification, as it represents a sequence from abstract thoughts over planning of an initiative to concrete implementation. The realization that certain health and welfare challenges cannot be dealt with from a single disciplinary perspective thus calls for a re-evaluation of approaches to deal with health and welfare challenges. “OH thinking” is holistic, inclusive, respectful, and tolerant, as opposed to approaches that are specific, reductionist, with a tendency to focus on single or limited outcomes that impact positively on few people only. It considers multiple scales of life, disciplines, sectors, species, paradigms, and demographics, and integrates at different spatial scales (e.g., locally, nationally, and globally). This should reflect the connected nature of social relations and social systems, both in their material and symbolic dimensions as well as the degradation of national resources due to globalization (18). “OH planning” requires that aims, problem formulation, responsibilities, and financing are organized, regardless of organizational hierarchies, paradigms, sectors, and disciplines. Most fundamentally, it necessitates clarity in establishing roles, tasks, responsibilities, and competencies (including leadership, power, and authority) within the specific OH initiative. OH aims to identify acceptable and manageable solutions to problems within a given context. Only after establishing a consensus, it (OH) can work and responsibilities be effectively allocated within the system.\", \"Consequently, “OH working” relies on transdisciplinary collaboration that embraces contributions from the biological, natural and social sciences, and actively includes stakeholders in the process, from problem definitions to resolution. To operate as conceived, OH must rely on adequate information infrastructure and foster learning across all scales and fields (19). A learning framework allows for stakeholders and institutions to evolve and improve autonomously, and requires mechanisms for knowledge exchange, institutional memory, feedback, and regulation. This relies on sharing of knowledge, data, resources, and staff across sectors and disciplines. This working paradigm will often lead to complex, polycentric organizational structures that support development toward sustainability and resilience (20). To succeed, they rely on multiple, strong connections and coordinated activities across sectors, for example, joint health services for humans and animals (21, 22), and/or for the environment (23).\", \"The expected outcomes of OH initiatives are health and welfare of humans, animals, plants, and ecosystems, all managed by common health strategies. This ensures healthy food, as well as clean water and air. Transdisciplinarity should result in improved stewardship and compliance, and promote interspecies equity, which would facilitate sustainable benefits for humans from other species (domestic and wild) and their habitats. Furthermore, OH should improve effectiveness across different sectors and at multiple scales. It relies on and results in more efficient communication, thereby generating a higher degree of awareness that can enable rapid detection of illness and consequent action. By having a more inclusive voice for neglected human populations, animals, and environment, OH is intended to widen our usual anthropocentric perspectives and to simultaneously enhance human health. The expected outcomes of OH approaches contribute to the three pillars of sustainability, namely, society, environment, and economy. In this way, the approach can be an instrument to working toward the UN sustainable development goals.2 Overall, OH is expected to result in the consideration of long-term effects of policy decisions, resilience at various scales, food and feed security, and ultimately sustainable lifestyles.\", \"Most diseases identified by WHO in their global burden of disease analysis,3 from neglected zoonotic and tropical diseases to lifestyle diseases (e.g., depression, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, and malnutrition) are derived, to some degree, from the social–ecological system in which they occur. Many isolated disciplinary or sectoral approaches to deal with these health challenges have proven ineffective, either not durable or associated with economic and/or environmental damage (4, 7). The change of focus from disease to health across species, ecosystems, and scales constitutes an effective model to address these challenges. This model extends from cells, through individuals, populations to global systems and across different time scales (4). Some propose considering health beyond health, i.e., the global economic, political, and cultural context, where, for example, the changing patterns of emerging diseases in Africa or Asia may be caused by investment strategies at the New York, London, and Hong Kong stock exchanges (17, 24).\", \"As demonstrated by the global AIDS response, this inclusive governance challenges current global norms, calls for global accountability, and reveals inextricable links between health, human rights, and social, economic, and political empowerment (25). By formulating apparently distant threats, such as climate change or soil erosion, from a health perspective, legal or economic actions may be accelerated, thereby leading to political decisions (6), through the willingness to accept trade-offs. Many health decisions are linked to dilemmas between scales, namely, individual versus social or global ecological interests. The solution lies in a continuous process of negotiation that includes all stakeholders and results in benefits from the interaction between different sectors (26). OH acknowledges that people’s choices are made within a context of economic, social, and cultural values.\", \"Such a change in approach requires resources. Consequently, it is important to demonstrate common interests of economic, environmental, social, and health advocates to provide appropriate funding, albeit under challenging economic constraints (6). We identified clear parallels between OH and the concept of sustainability with its three pillars, i.e., society, environment, and economy. On this basis, the added value of OH as compared to single sector approaches can be assessed through monitoring aspects in these three pillars. For example, the social dimension may be monitored by examining the acceptability of interventions, the contribution to enhancing human capital, supporting solidarity, maintaining equity, diversity, participation, interconnectedness and partnerships, democracy, and political alignment and their adaptations to the relevant social–ecological context. The environmental dimension may be monitored using fresh-water quality, ocean quality, air and soil quality, biodiversity, species-specific health, and the overlap with ecosystem services. Finally, the economic dimension can be assessed by estimating the costs and the benefits of interventions to the widest possible extent, including not only the values that can be directly appraised through market prices but also the values of non-market goods and resources, which mostly depend on environmental and social achievements and are of particular importance for human and animal health and welfare.\", \"To achieve systemic and scaled resilience to health challenges, the ultimate task for policy makers and other health professionals is to endorse health of people, animals, plants, and the environment and to achieve equitable and sustainable health outcomes (27, 28). To implement the concept of OH, “OH thinking,” “planning,” and “working” promote equity beyond health services and keep health (human, animal, and environmental) as the central focus (1, 2). Resilience in human and animal population health has clear benefits for the environment and the economy, at both national and global levels. Additionally, maintaining health is more ethical than facilitating recovery from illness (27). In many cases, isolated policies have contributed to ineffective responses to (emerging) infectious and non-communicable diseases. Health is essential for societal well-being, and many current health challenges are beyond the capacity of any one discipline or jurisdiction to meet. We need to embrace this and facilitate appropriate and sustained responses. For example, the emergence of infectious diseases, including zoonoses, and multidrug resistance is determined by variables including economic conditions, population changes (both humans and animals), and land use changes (29, 30). The consequences include changes in behavior and habits, as well as in intensification of production, trade, habitat change, loss of biodiversity, and globalization (24, 31). These in turn affect the economic conditions, population numbers, and land use, which emphasizes the co-evolutionary nature of these interactions. The long history of cohabitation between humans and animals suggests multiple synergistic effects. However, current trends lead to segregation of species in isolated habitats with complete loss of these synergies. The OH concept can shape this cohabitation, in a positive way, rather than being driven by fear and rejection. Ideas such as zoobiquity explore how animal–human commonalities can be used to diagnose, treat, and heal patients of all species, not just humans (32). The current challenge is to shape national, regional, and global institutions to facilitate these transdisciplinary processes and to provide methods to assess their level of integration as well as the evolution of the affected system. Health professionals have previously been at the forefront of social change, gradually making smoking and poor dietary habits increasingly unacceptable (6). It is now time to advocate for continuous adaptation of the underlying determinants of health, in particular interspecies equity, stewardship, and resilience to achieve a healthy and sustainable future for all.\", \"The article is the result of a workshop.

Mosquitoes transmitting DENV in humans has been a major cause of dengue diseases in tropical and subtropical counties; approximately one-third of the world's population is at risk of the infection. People infected with DENV typically show self-limited febrile dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is more likely to occur after a second DENV infection [1], [2]. Other than supportive treatments, no specific therapy is available for dengue-related diseases. Several tetravalent DENV vaccine candidates are under development, but an effective, safe and affordable dengue vaccine remains elusive [3].\", \"DENV infects multiple organs and cell types in humans. Particularly, the mononuclear phagocyte lineage of macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and skin Langerhans cells are the primary cell targets [4], [5], [6]. Similar cellular tropism of macrophages and DCs was observed in the experimental DENV mouse infection model [7]. Macrophages and DCs are the most crucial cell types in innate immunity and rapidly produce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to fight against microbe invasion. Type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of virus replication. Therefore, many pathogenic viruses have developed strategies to escape the IFN-triggered anti-viral effects. More than 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described [8]. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, an IFN stimulator, with its protease NS3/4A [9]. The nonstructural proteins NS4B of DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) block the activation of STAT1 in cells stimulated with type I IFN [10], [11].\", \"We previously found that two flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and DENV-2, trigger type I IFN transcription through an RIG-I-dependent signaling cascade to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-κB. However, JEV induced higher activation of IRF3 and NF-κB than DENV-2 in human A549 cells [12]. Furthermore, type I IFN production triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation was blocked in DENV-2-infected human DCs [13], [14]. Microarray results from rhesus macaques also indicated that type I IFN, interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were not upregulated with DENV-1 infection [15]. Therefore, DENV-2 might modulate the induction pathway of type I IFN and other cytokines.\", \"The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is one of the best-studied pattern-recognition receptor families and is responsible for sensing invading pathogens [16]. Different TLRs recognize the different molecular patterns of microorganisms; for example, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Engagement of TLRs with their ligands triggers signal cascades to activate IRFs and NF-κB, thus leading to production of cytokines and type I IFN [17]. NF-κB activation is crucial for cytokine induction, and many viruses evolve various strategies to manipulate NF-κB signaling [18], [19]. Several RNA virus-encoded proteins, such as HCV NS5B, SARS CoV M protein, measles virus V protein, and enterovirus 71 2C, inhibit NF-κB activation directly or indirectly [20], [21], [22], [23].\", \"In this study, we investigated whether DENV-2 could block type I IFN and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. We studied the influence of DENV-2 infection on activation of NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).\", \"The DENV-2 PL046 strain (Genbank accession: AJ968413.1) was isolated from a Taiwanese DF patient. The DENV-2 prototype New Guinea C (NGC) strain was kindly provided by D. J. Gubler of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. These viruses were propagated in the mosquito cell line C6/36 (ATCC: CRL-1660) grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [24]. The J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line (ATCC: TIB-67), A549 human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line (ATCC: CCL-185), and African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line Vero (ATCC: CCL-81) were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). The TLR3 ligand polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotides 1826 (CpG ODN 1826; hereafter CpG) were from InvivoGen. The TLR4 ligand LPS (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling, catalog# 9102 and 9101S) and anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.\", \"Female C57BL/6 mice at 6–8 weeks old were used in accordance with the guidelines of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital animal care and use committee under the approved animal study protocol (VGHKS-99-A028). BMDCs were generated by culturing bone-marrow hematopoietic cells with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) for 8 days [25], [26]. For DENV-2 infection, 106 DCs were adsorbed with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 1 h. After removing the virus inoculant, cells were incubated with complete medium. For stimulation with TLR ligands, DCs were incubated with 100 µg/ml polyI:C or 1 µg/ml CpG.\", \"TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA extraction, and cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 µg total RNA by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR amplification was done with 4 ng cDNA in 10 µl SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) with 3 µM of primers in the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).

Cells cultured in 12-well plate were transfected with NF-κB- or IFN-β-Luc reporter plasmids [12], [25]. pRL-TK (Promega), encoding Renilla luciferase under an HSV thymidine kinase promoter, was used as an internal control. After transfection for 24 h, cells were infected with DENV-2; in some experiments, cells were further stimulated with LPS or polyI:C (both 1 µg/ml). Cell lysates were collected at the indicated times for dual-luciferase assays (Promega). Relative firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.\", \"Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]) containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche). Harvested cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were reacted with primary antibody, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and visualized with an enhance chemiluminescence system (Thermo). Images were acquired by a digital image system (UVP or Fujifilm).\", \"To study the effect of DENV-2 on modulating innate immune response, we determined the levels of type I IFN and cytokines in DENV-2–infected mouse BMDCs by quantitative RT-PCR. The TLR3 ligand polyI:C and the TLR9 ligand CpG greatly stimulated the mRNA expression of IFN-β (124-fold induction at 2 h by polyI:C and 531-fold induction at 6 h by CpG), IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG), IL-12p40 (381-fold at 24 h by polyI:C and 1551-fold at 6 h by CpG), and TNFα (64-fold at 2 h by polyI:C and 180-fold at 6 h by CpG) (Figure 1A–D, left panels). However, levels of IFN-β and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1, left and right panels): especially, IL-10 was not induced by DENV-2 infection. The kinetic of DENV-2 replication in BMDCs was measured by qPCR with primers specific for DENV-2 5′-UTR (Figure 1E) and by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure 1F). DENV-2 replication peaked around 12–24 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12–36 h post infection. Therefore, infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression and that of other cytokines. Since DENV-2 infection would produce intracellular viral RNA to turn on RLR and TLR signaling cascades for cytokine production, weak induction of DENV-2 for these cytokine genes (Figure 1) implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines.\", \"To determine whether DENV infection could suppress the cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling, we investigated infection with a murine macrophage cell line J774A.1. Consistent with previous report that J774A.1 is susceptible to DENV infection [27], DENV-2 infection in J774A.1 was shown by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure S1A), and by qPCR with DENV-2 5′ UTR primers (Figure S1B). J774A.1 cells were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2, then stimulated with LPS or polyI:C. LPS and polyI:C readily promoted the expression of IFN-β (Figure 2A and B; left panels) and IL-10 (Figure 2A and B right panels), but with DENV-2, the expression was diminished. Similar results were noticed in DENV-2-infected BMDCs that polyI:C-activated IFN-β and IL-10 were reduced with DENV-2 infection (Figure 2C). Thus, DENV-2 appears to interfere with IFN-β and cytokine production triggered by TLRs signaling cascade.\", \"NF-κB is an essential molecule in the TLR signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN-β and cytokines [16], [28], [29]. In our infection system, two strains of DENV-2, PL046 and NGC, triggered low degree of NFκB p65 nuclear translocation. Nuclear staining of p65 was noted in 7% and 13% of PL046- and NGC-infected cells, respectively (Figure S2A panels b and c); in contrast, about 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-κB p65 (Figure S2A, panel d). Thus, we checked whether DENV-2 could suppress NF-κB activation triggered by TLRs engagement. With use of a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, NF-κB activation stimulated by the TLR ligands LPS and polyI:C was readily blocked in DENV-2-infected cells at 12 and 24 h post stimulation (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting result of DENV-2 NS3 indicated that the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment (Figure 3B). As well, DENV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-κB activation in Vero cells as measured by nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (Figure 4A); similar results were also observed in J774A.1 macrophages (Figure S2B). Nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was slightly increased in A549 cells up to 60 h post DENV-2 infection, but the polyI:C-triggered p65 nuclear translocation was greatly blocked in DENV-2 infected cells (Figure S2C). We also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication, polyI:C pretreatment blocked DENV-2 replication; whereas, the antiviral effect of polyI:C was not seen in cells with established DENV-2 infection (Figure 4B). This data is consistent with previous report [30] and suggest that DENV-2 inhibits TLR signaling to benefit its replication. DENV-2 replication in these two cell lines, A549 and Vero, was confirmed by qPCR with viral 5′ UTR primers and plaque assay for virion production (Figure S3). Thus, DENV-2 downregulates TLR-activated NF-κB, which leads to reduced cytokine expression.\", \"The activity of ERK is associated with the expression of type I IFN and cytokines, particularly IL-10 [31], [32], [33]. We thus further checked whether DENV-2 targets ERK activation by examining the phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK). DENV-2 infection did not activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and even impaired the basal level of p-ERK1/2 (Figure 5A). Furthermore, polyI:C- and LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was decreased with DENV-2 infection (Figure 5B and 5C), so DENV blocks TLR-mediated ERK activation to modulate both arms of the innate immunity response to infection: type I IFN and cytokines.\", \"The pathogenesis mechanism of severe DHF/DSS with DENV infection is not well understood, but evidence suggests that the magnitude of DENV replication and its regulation of innate and adaptive immunity may both contribute [34]. The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1]. Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35], [36], [37]. In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNFα were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2-infected BMDCs. Furthermore, even in the absence of enhancing antibody, DENV could block NF-κB activation and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. Downregulation of the cytokine system may provide a growth advantage for DENV to propagate in host macrophages and DCs.\", \"IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressor produced by several immune cells [38], and its expression can be triggered by TLR [31], [32]. IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions caused by the host immune system responding to infections [39], [40]. DHF patients showed high serum levels of IL-10, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [41], [42]. In a WNV animal infection model, IL-10 downregulated T cell-mediated immunity and had a negative role in antiviral immunity [43]. Thus, our findings that DENV-2 failed to induce IL-10 expression in BMDCs (Figure 1) are unexpected but are consistent with previous reports that IL-10 is not produced from mature human CD1a+ DCs infected with DENV-2 [44], [45] and that microarray data from DENV-1-infected rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes [15]. In addition, we found that DENV-2 could inhibit TLR-triggered IL-10 expression. Therefore, the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be simply stimulated by the DENV itself. Instead, it may be resulted from uncontrolled DENV replication, which then triggers increased levels of immune activation and increased IL-10 production. DENV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system and results in increased DENV production [35], [37], [45]. Thus, DENV infection via ADE or non-ADE routes might have different effects in the immune system.\", \"TLR signaling cascades are mainly controlled by the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, which both lead to activation of NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [17], [46]. NF-κB and MAPKs have been suggested to have critical roles in cytokine induction [47], [48]. A recent study showed that constitutive intestinal NF-κB activation does not lead to destructive inflammation unless accompanied by activation of MAPKs such as p38 and ERK [49]. Our results that DENV-2 blocked activation of NF-κB, as well as ERK1/2, support our findings of cytokine production hampered in DENV-2-infected cells. Because both NFκB and ERK1/2 were affected, DENV may suppress an upstream molecular event such as TLR gene expression, as that has been reported for DENV infection through an ADE route [37]. We also detected TLR genes expression in DENV-2 infected J774A.1 macrophages and found that polyI:C-triggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2 (Figure S4, panels a–c), but not for that of TRL6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR2 (Figure S4, panels d–g). In contrast, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation (Figure S4, panels h–i), suggesting that DENV-2 may modulate certain TLR genes expression in macrophage. Other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN-β promoter activation [13], may target common molecules involved in type I IFN and cytokine production in TLR signaling, or whether ISG15 that is induced by DENV-2 and functions as an inhibitor of type I IFN production [50] may also contribute to immune evasion, remain to be further studied.\", \"Taiwanese DENV-2 strain PL046 used in this study was isolated from patient with DF, and this virus has been used in the studies of viral pathogenesis and host responses mechanism in vitro and in vivo\\n[7], [12], [51], [52], [53]. Other groups have reported that DENV-2 strains MON601 (a laboratory strain of NGC) and 16681 downregulate the activation of NF-κB and production of type I IFN and TNFα in human DC, macrophage, and Huh7 cells [14], [54]. A recent report by Chase A. J. et al. [55] also revealed that human DCs infected with several endemic DENV-2 strains failed to polarize the naïve CD4+ T cells to effectors, suggesting a defect on T cell priming for DENV-infected DCs [55]. However, one of the strain ARA6894 did not show such kind of inhibition effect, as ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4+ Th1 polarization with high expression of IFNγ and TNFα. Interestingly, the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains such as PL046, 16681 and NGC [55], suggesting that different impacts on DC's function between these DENV-2 strains might be due to viral genome diversity.\", \"Dengue may be the most important arboviral disease potentially affecting 2 to 3 billion people living in tropical and subtropical areas. DENV mainly infects monocytes, macrophages and DCs that are also the most important innate immune cells. The balance between the protective and pathological immune responses likely contributes to the DENV infection outcomes. Our results demonstrating that DENV can modulate the signaling events triggered by several TLRs are of interest and provide an explanation for how DENV may skew the host immune system.\"],\n    tags: {\n      sciwingI2B2: {}\n    }\n  },\n  url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425550/\"\n}, {\n  paper_id: \"PMC7202825\",\n  doi: \"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.016\",\n  title: \"Emergent hospital reform in response to outbreak of COVID-19\",\n  doc_date: \"2020-05-06\",\n  authors: [\"Jingwen.Li\", \"Qing.Zhang\", \"Xi.Fang\", \"Na.Li\", \"Caiying.Hu\", \"Zhicheng.Lin\", \"Nian.Xiong\"],\n  summary: \"\",\n  abstract: {\n    text: [],\n    tags: {\n      sciwing: []\n    }\n  },\n  bodyText: {\n    section_header: {\n      original: [\"Author Contributions\", \"Funding\", \"Declaration of Competing Interest\", \"Uncited reference\"],\n      generic: [\"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"conclusions\", \"method\"]\n    },\n    text: [\"JL, XF and QZ drafted the manuscript and share first authorship.

administration of multiple drugs is currently the standard treatment for HIV infection. The drug combinations used in this setting normally consist of several inhibitors that target different enzymes in the viral life-cycle, including reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Although HAART can dramatically decrease the levels of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, the emergence of drug resistance is usually unavoidable because of the high mutation and rapid replication rates of the virus. The sequential administration of different drugs is therefore required for the treatment of HIV infection, as well as the development of new targeted therapies [1]. Enfuvirtide (ENF) is an important choice for the treatment of patients who have not responded well to HAART. In contrast to traditional small-molecule enzyme inhibitors, ENF is a 36-residue peptide that binds to the viral envelope gp41 protein and inhibits the gp41-mediated membrane fusion between the virus and the host-cell, which is an essential step for the delivery of the viral genome into the cell [2]. ENF has been successfully used in clinic practice to control HIV infection and transmission. However, as is the case with many peptide and protein drugs [3], ENF exhibits poor aqueous solubility and can be rapidly removed from systemic circulation through metabolic pathways and immune response systems. To maintain an efficacious concentration, ENF must be administered twice daily at a high dosage (90 mg) by subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, ENF therapy must be implemented consistently over an extended period of time because of the chronic nature of HIV infection [4], which can lead to severe injection-site reactions [5]. ENF treatment is therefore inconvenient to the patient and represents an expensive regimen for the health care provider, and these factors have severely limited its application in the clinic.\",\r\n        \"A number of different approaches have been developed to address the pharmacokinetic problems associated with ENF and several other peptide analogues, which can inhibit HIV fusion in a similar manner. Peptide engineering strategies, such as the incorporation of salt bridges, can lead to increases in the in vivo stability of a peptide sequence, which can result in extended half-lives [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The chemical modification of a peptide with a synthetic or natural molecule, such as cholesterol [11] or albumin [12], [13], can also lead to a reduction in its immunogenicity and proteolysis [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation is a commonly used method for improving the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic peptides and proteins [21], [22], [23], and this method has been applied to a peptide inhibitor of HIV fusion that overlaps ENF by 33 residues [19]. The PEGylated peptide showed a 3.4-fold increase in the half-life against tryptic degradation, although there was a slight decrease in the fusion-inhibitory potency when compared with the unmodified peptide. Despite the positive results reported in this study for the PEGylation of the inhibitor, there have been no reports in the literature to date pertaining to the antiviral activity or the pharmacokinetic properties of a fusion inhibitor conjugated with PEG.\",\r\n        \"As part of our ongoing research towards the development of persistent inhibitors against HIV fusion, we previously developed a series of glycosylated ENFs with long in vivo half-lives that completely retained their antiviral activities [20]. In a similar manner to PEGylation, the glycosylation of peptides and proteins leads to an increase in their molecular size and steric bulk, which can have a significant impact on their biophysical and physiological properties. However, current techniques for the construction of glycopeptides and glycoproteins are quite challenging. Recombinant expression systems allow for the rapid and large-scale production of glycopeptides and glycoproteins, but these systems provided only limited control over the glycosylation step [24]. Chemical and chemoenzymatic syntheses can produce structurally well-defined molecules [25], [26], but generally require multiple steps and tedious purification procedures that can result in low production yields, thereby limiting their practical application.\",\r\n        \"Based on our previous experience of the glycosylation of ENF [20], and the fact that PEGylation has advanced many bioactive proteins and peptides into clinical applications [23], we sought to prepare the ENF−PEG (EP) conjugate as a simple alternative. By controlling the modification site of ENF and the molecular weight (MW) of PEG, we successfully synthesized an EP conjugate with a remarkably improved pharmacokinetic profile. This conjugate formed a strong binding interaction with a functional fragment of the gp41 protein and exhibited potent inhibitory activities towards various HIV isolates that are currently in circulation, with in vitro efficacies comparable to that of ENF. It is therefore envisaged that the results presented in this study will provide a basis for the development of further EP conjugates as long-lasting HIV fusion inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection.\",\r\n        \"Following our established glycosylation strategy [20], we investigated the site-specific addition of PEG to the terminus of ENF using a thiol-maleimide coupling reaction (Fig. 1\\n). Two ENF derivatives bearing a single cysteine residue at their N- or C-termini (cENF and ENFc) were modified with methoxy-PEG-maleimides (mPEG-MAL) of 2 and 5 kDa. These reactions proceeded smoothly under near-physiological conditions to give the corresponding EP conjugates bearing the fully intact ENF sequence. The conjugates were purified by preparative HPLC, followed by the lyophilization of the resulting residues to give the desired products as white powders in 82–90% yields (purity >95%). The subsequent characterization of the conjugates by MALDI-TOF MS revealed a single defined attachment of PEG to the peptide backbone. As expected, all of the conjugates were highly soluble in water (≥3 mg/mL) as opposed to ENF, which has negligible aqueous solubility.\",\r\n        \"To ensure that the modified ENF retained its binding affinity for the HIV gp41 protein, we measured the strength of the binding interaction between the conjugates and a functional fragment of gp41 known as N46, which contains the full binding region for ENF and has been used as a suitable model for the investigations of HIV fusion inhibitors [27], [28], [29]. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments showed that all the conjugates strongly bound to N46 with affinities (K\\nd) in the range of 307–1410 nM (Fig. 2\\n). Although the affinities of the conjugates were lower than that of ENF (182 nM), we observed a general trend towards increasing affinity as the MW of the PEG portion of the conjugate decreased. Particularly, the PEG2k-ENF demonstrated an affinity (307 nM) approximating to that of ENF. In contrast, none of the EP conjugates or ENF bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA), confirming that the observed interactions were specific for peptide N46. The SPR experiments measured the binding of ENF or EP conjugates to the chip-immobilized N46, and the assay condition did not exactly match with the membrane environment necessary for the fusion inhibition. However, the potent interaction between EP conjugates and N46 confirmed in this assay suggested that the attached PEG had no significant impact on the intrinsic binding affinity of ENF.\",\r\n        \"Peptide conformation can have a remarkable effect on the antiviral activity of fusion inhibitors [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. ENF lacks a defined structure in solution, where it has a low α-helicity. In contrast, N46 adopts a typical α-helical conformation in solution, and its α-helicity is reduced dramatically upon its binding to ENF. The ENF and EP conjugates prepared in this study were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD), and the results revealed that the low α-helical content of ENF was further decreased by the attached PEG in a MW-dependent manner (Fig. 3\\nA). Interestingly, all of the conjugates interacted with N46 to form stable α-helical complexes, which had markedly higher α-helicities than that of N46 alone or in complex with ENF (Fig. 3B). This result is, however, inconsistent with the affinity of the conjugates for N46 which is obviously lower than that of ENF, as the α-helicity of binding complexes is positively correlated to their stability [28], [29]. The apparent contradiction between the affinity and the α-helicity likely resulted from the different assay formats. Unlike the chip-based SPR assay in which N46 was immobilized on a solid surface, in CD experiment free N46 and the EP conjugate in solution were able to partake in a dynamic binding process that allowed the attached PEG to interact with the binding complex and the aqueous medium. The mechanism of the improvement in the α-helicity of the complex following PEGylation has not yet been determined. However, the ability of the attached PEG to form an amphiphilic shell capable of stabilizing the coiled-coil peptide core under aqueous conditions [36], [37], [38], may provide some evidence in support of our results.\",\r\n        \"Having established that the EP conjugates could bind to the gp41 fragment to form high affinity complexes with high α-helicities, we examined their antiviral activities against a laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain SF33. The replication of the virus in TZM-bl cells [39] was measured in the presence of the conjugates, with ENF as a control (Table 1\\n). ENF and all of the conjugates inhibited the replication of HIV at nanomolar concentrations, with no cytotoxicity observed below the micromolar range (CC50 > 100 μM), as determined using an XTT assay [41]. The two conjugates bearing the smaller PEG (2 kDa) showed higher activities than their 5 kDa counterparts. The N-terminally PEGylated peptides showed much greater activity than their C-terminal congeners, with the PEG2k-ENF exhibiting the highest inhibitory activity of all the conjugates. Notably, the EC50 value of PEG2k-ENF (4 nM) was comparable to that of ENF (3 nM). The chemical modification at the C-terminus of ENF has an adverse impact on its antiviral activity [11], [12], [20], because the lipophilic residues (WNWF) in this region are required for the anchoring of the peptide into the membrane interface where the fusion occurs [28], [29]. Our data were therefore in agreement with these earlier findings and revealed that the attachment of PEG2k to the N-terminus of ENF did not lead to a significant decrease in its antiviral efficacy.\",\r\n        \"We next analyzed the pharmacokinetics of PEG2k-ENF in rats following the subcutaneous injection of a single dose of this material (Fig. 4\\n). In contrast to ENF, which was both rapidly adsorbed and rapidly cleared from systemic circulation, the EP conjugate showed a slower but more sustained release profile from the injection site. The calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters using the well-established non-compartmental method [44] revealed that the conjugate had an elimination half-life [45] (T\\n1/2) which was over 10-fold longer than that of ENF. The overall pharmacokinetic profile of PEG2k-ENF was also superior to that of ENF, with marked increases in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), apparent volume of distribution (V\\nd), and mean residence time (MRT), as well as a marked decrease in systematic clearance rate (CL). This improvement in pharmacokinetic profile, as generally seen for many other PEGylated protein or peptide therapeutics [21], [22], [23], makes the EP conjugate attractive as a long-lasting fusion inhibitor to address the unmet medical needs associated with the treatment of HIV infection.\",\r\n        \"To further evaluate the therapeutic potential of PEG2k-ENF, we examined its antiviral spectrum using fourteen HIV-1 viruses of different subtypes, including five B′ (also known as Thai B), five BC, and four AE isolates, all of which represent the predominant strains currently circulating in China [46], [47], [48], [49]. The PEG2k-ENF inhibited the replication of these viruses in TZM-bl cells as efficacious as ENF, with activities (EC50) in the low-nanomolar range (Table 2\\n) and selectivity indices (SI) greater than 1000. Taken together with its remarkably improved pharmacokinetic properties, the broad and potent antiviral activities of PEG2k-ENF show that the EP conjugates warrant further preclinical and clinical evaluations.\",\r\n        \"We have demonstrated that the site-specific PEGylation of ENF improved its pharmacokinetic profile without discernible decrease in its antiviral activity. The coupling of cENF to mPEG-MAL through a concise thiol-maleimide reaction allowed for the large-scale synthesis of the EP conjugate, which could be important for clinical applications that require a sufficient supply of material. The EP conjugate exhibited much better aqueous solubility and in vivo half-life than ENF, which could lead to less-frequent dosing regimens and a reduction in adverse injection-site reactions. In addition, the EP conjugate displayed potent inhibitory activity towards the most common primary HIV strains circulating in China, further highlighting its potential as an effective and long-acting inhibitor of HIV fusion. It is noteworthy that a number of other enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have similar mechanisms of virus−cell fusion to that observed in HIV infection. With this in mind, it is envisaged that the peptide inhibitors currently under investigation against these viruses [50], [51], [52], [53] could also be subjected to the PEGylation approach described in this study.\",\r\n        \"All peptides used in this study were synthesized using a solid-phase Fmoc method at Beijing Scilight Biotechnology LLC (Beijing, China), purified by HPLC (purity >95%), and characterized by MALDI−TOF MS. The sources of HIV-1SF33 and TZM-bl, as well as the methods used for their preservation and passage have been described previously [20], [41]. The clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtypes B′, BC, and AE were obtained from treatment-naive patients and stored at our laboratory in Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [46], [47]. These viruses represent the predominant strains circulating in China from 2005 to 2008. Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 7 weeks old, and 150–180 g) were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience (Beijing, China) and fed for 2 days before being used for pharmacokinetic analysis. mPEG-MAL (2 and 5 kDa) was purchased from Beijing Kaizheng Biotech Development (Beijing, China).

Briefly, N46 was immobilized on a carboxymethyl dextran-coated sensor chip (CM-5, research grade) using a standard primary amine-coupling protocol. Solutions of EP conjugates in PBS containing Tween 20 (0.05% v/v) at different concentrations (0.125–4 μM) were then flowed over the surface of the sensor at a rate of 20 μl/min, and the responses were recorded.

Death losses of sexually mature breeding animals and market hogs add more economic burden to producers. In many situations, both infectious and non-infectious causes can account for reproductive problems and mortality; infectious diseases are considerably more important because of the rapid transmission between animals and many times the lack of effective preventive measures.\",\r\n        \"Since at least 1995, pork producers and swine practitioners have reported disease outbreaks characterized primarily by early infertility, hence commonly referred to as “sow infertility syndrome” or “growth depression syndrome” (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Typically, producers have observed an acute decline in farrowing rate due to increased early or delayed returns followed by a prolonged period (up to 2 years) of sub-optimal farrowing performance. Loss of pregnancy most commonly occurs in the early stages of gestation (i.e., 30–55 days), although abortion and reproductive failure were reported on sows at later gestations. Affected animals which were confirmed pregnant at 30 days either aborted or demonstrated irregular return to estrus. Besides reproductive disorder, many of the affected animals were presented with neurological signs, such as posterior weakness/paralysis, ataxia, bar chewing, and head pressing/banging (Yoon, 2003). The neurologic symptoms in affected individuals progressed, with death in 2 or 3 days as the usual outcome. Central nervous signs were also observed in younger pigs such as nursery and fattening pigs. To reflect various clinical manifestations, the newly identified disease has also been commonly referred to as “Porcine Reproductive and Neurologic Syndrome (PRNS)”. Reproductive and neurologic problems were not, however, always present simultaneously.\",\r\n        \"The incidence of the problem seems to continue growing. The pattern of spread within and between herds implies the involvement of an infectious agent. To date, affected herds have been observed in both PRRSV-infected and PRRSV-free swine herds in many states including Iowa (Yoon, 2003). Although many cases with similar clinical presentations have been presented to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL), a conclusive diagnosis could not be reached to date (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998). Laboratory testing including serology, has not yet demonstrated the role of any recognized reproductive or neurologic pathogens of swine associated with the symptoms described above, including foreign or exotic viral agents. No bacterial or viral pathogens were consistently identified in index cases. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the condition is toxin-related, or associated with any particular management practice or pig genotype. Therefore, the disease was thought to be due to a previously unrecognized agent. With that hypothesis, the following extensive laboratory diagnostic investigations were conducted to identify the causative agent.\",\r\n        \"Index animals were selected for diagnostic investigations from herds showing the following clinical presentations: Sows exhibiting an unusually high early return or abortion after 30 but before 50 days of gestation; animals that were lethargic, restless, and/or dyspneic particularly after exercise prior to losing the pregnancy; some of the affected animals were also febrile and pale. Besides reproductive failure, some of the affected pregnant sows and weaned pigs also showed neurological signs such as posterior weakness, paresis, ataxia, lameness, head pressing or banging and aggressive behavior often leading to abrasions on the forehead, nose and front legs as well as abortion. Neonates showed “shaking” and many times appeared to be blind as those animals could not walk in one direction. Central nervous signs were also observed in grower-finishers. Some pigs recovered but the majority of affected animals died within several days of showing clinical signs. Sometimes affected animals died suddenly without any overt proceeding clinical signs. To avoid any potential confusion, animals from known PRRS-positive herds were not included in the study.\",\r\n        \"Serum, whole blood and tissues (brain, secondary lymphoid tissues, kidney, liver) were collected from each animal and used for laboratory testing.

Fixed tissues were also stained with commercially obtained polyclonal antiserum for ruminant/caprine pestivirus antibodies (440-BDV 9001) from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, IA, USA). The bovine serum was diluted 1:80 in the 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 for tissue material from sows. Slides flooded with the antibodies were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humid condition and then rinsed with PBS three times.

In brief, confluent monolayer of CL ISUVDL33 and CL ISUVDL99 cells were prepared in 96-well plates and inoculated with virus suspensions (100 μl/well) which were prepared by a serial 10-fold dilution technique. After 1-hr of absorption at 37 °C, the virus inoculum was removed and cells replenished with MEM supplemented with 40 or 160 μg/ml of BUDR (Sigma Chemical Co.) or 2 or 20 μg/ml of mitomycin C (Sigma Chemical Co.). Plates were incubated for an additional 48 h; virus titer was determined by the presence of visible CPE and then confirmed by IFA staining using rabbit antiserum raised against virus isolate designated ISUYP604671 from a PRNS case. As controls for RNA and DNA viruses, PRRSV and PRV, respectively were concurrently titrated under the same conditions described above.\",\r\n        \"Seven sows at 4th or 5th parity were purchased from a high-health-status commercial vendor and transferred to an animal holding facility with farrowing crates and bred through artificial insemination. The facility was operated and managed at BSL2 compliance. Once pregnancy was confirmed by an ultrasound technique, 5 sows were selected and used for the study. Four of the 5 sows at 30 days of gestation were inoculated intranasally, subcutaneously and intramuscularly with one of the following biological materials: (a) cell culture fluid containing virus isolate designated ISUYP604671; (b) homogenate of tissues collected from a clinically affected sow; (c) serum collected from the clinically affected sow. All inoculated animals were kept in the same room but individually in farrowing crates for 30 days. The one remaining sows served as sham-inoculated control and was kept in a separate room. After inoculation, all animals were monitored for changes in behavior and any reproductive problems. In addition, the sows were bled every seven days. At the termination of the study, all sows were euthanized, and various tissues (brain, tonsil, lung, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver, placenta, spinal cord, uterus, uterine fluid) and, if present, fetuses were collected from each sow for histopathology, virus isolation and/or serology.\",\r\n        \"Seven 7-week-old caesarian-derived-colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs were used to evaluate the clinical effect of Virus X on young swine. Animals were divided to 3 groups. Group 1 (n\\n = 3) was inoculated with cell culture material containing Virus X (ISUYP604671) via intranasal, intramuscular and intravenous routes. Group 2 (n\\n = 3) was inoculated via the same routes with serum from an animal (Sow 800) which was experimentally infected with the virus in the previous animal study. Group 3 (n\\n = 1) was inoculated with virus-free cell culture fluid and served as sham-inoculated negative control. All animals were monitored for the first 2 weeks after inoculation for changes in rectal temperature and behavior and for clinical signs. One pig per group except group 3 was euthanized and necropsied on days 7, 10 and 14 PI. Tissues (brain, tonsil, lung, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes) were collected from each pig for both virus assays and histopathology. Animals were bled at days 0, 7, 10 and 14 PI to collect whole blood and serum. At day 14 PI all remaining animals were euthanized and necropsied.\",\r\n        \"Tissues were fixed by immersing in 10% neutral buffered formalin immediately after collection. Fixed tissues were processed, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned according to the standard protocol established at ISU-VDL. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic examination.\",\r\n        \"In many cases, external examination revealed trauma to the face and head of clinically affected pigs probably as a result of head-banging and head-pressing behaviors. Traumatic lesions were also seen in the extremities or shoulders possibly due to ataxia or recumbency.\",\r\n        \"While affected animals showed distinct clinical signs, gross lesions were not present except for the presence of petichial hemorrhage in lymph nodes and sometimes on the serosa of many organs. Microscopically, some lesions limited to the brain were detected as mild focal to locally extensive nonsuppurative perivascular cuffing, gliosis, and lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis. Hepatitis and interstitial pneumonia were other lesions frequently observed in the affected animals.\",\r\n        \"A cytopathic agent that could pass through a 0.22 μm membrane filter was repeatedly and consistently isolated from serum, tonsil, lymph nodes and/or brain from clinically affected animals. Because of its unknown identity, the agent was tentatively named “Virus X”. Two initial isolates were designated ISU-KJY96 and ISUYP604671, respectively. Besides Virus X, several other viruses, such as PEV, porcine reovirus and PRRSV, were also inconsistently and infrequently isolated from suspect animals.\",\r\n        \"Morphologically, Virus X was an enveloped virus with the size of approximately 50–55 nm in diameter. As shown in Fig. 1\\n, the virion contains an icosahedral core and acquires its envelope by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. Overall, Virus X resembles members of the family Arteriviridae, Flaviviridae or Togaviridae.\",\r\n        \"As summarized in Table 1\\n, infection and replication of the virus ISUYP604671, like PRRSV, was not negatively affected by the presence of BUDR and mitomycin C in cell culture media, whereas PRV replication was substantially inhibited by the treatment.\",\r\n        \"Various cell lines and primary cells of porcine origin were permissive to Virus X and supported productive infection of the virus (Fig. 2\\n). On immunofluorescence tests, Virus X did not cross-react with antibodies raised against PRRSV (type 1 and 2), PRV, SIV (both H1 and H3), TGEV, PPV, PCV (type 1 and 2), porcine reovirus, EMCV, PEV, HEV, PCMV and rabies virus. Interestingly, the virus appeared to be recognized to a degree by the polyclonal antiserum specific for BVDV as weak positive fluorescence was observed when Virus X infected cells were stained with the serum (Fig. 3\\n). However, PCR results for 5′UTR did not support that Virus X was BVDV (both type 1 and 2) or CSFV. PCR assays also demonstrated that Virus X was not PRRSV (neither North American nor European genotypes), PCV (neither type 1 nor 2), PEV (groups 1, 2 and 3), influenza A virus, TGEV, PRCV, PEDV, PPV, sHEV, WNV, JEV, PERV, PLHV-1 or alpha-togaviruses.\",\r\n        \"Clinical, pathological and virological observations on pregnant sows after experimental inoculation are summarized in Table 2\\n. During a 30-day observation period, inoculated sows became viremic. Yet, all animals remained normal in their behavior during the study period. No abortion was observed in any of the inoculated sows.\",\r\n        \"At the termination of the study, no lesions were observed in the control sow. In contrast, gross lesions, such as hemorrhages in inguinal lymph node and decolorization of the uterus (green and brown), were observed in the sows inoculated with materials containing Virus X (ISUYP604671). Embryonic or fetal death was also apparent in some of the inoculated sows. One of the 4 inoculated sows did not have any fetus at necropsy although no significant lesions were observed. Microscopically, necrotic edema in the lymph node, mineralization plaques in uterus and necrotic debris in the lumen of the uterus were observed, supporting the possibility of embryonic death and/or fetal reabsorption.\",\r\n        \"Virus X was recovered from tissues (spleen, liver, jejunum, uterus, serum, tonsil) of the inoculated sows, confirming the replication of Virus X in the animals, particularly in secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, the virus was also isolated from fetal tissues such as lung, spleen, heart and kidney, suggesting transplacental transmission of the virus.\",\r\n        \"All inoculated pigs became viremic during a 14-day observation period but did not show any overt clinical signs by the end of the study. The sham-inoculated negative control pigs remained negative for Virus X in the blood (Table 3\\n).\",\r\n        \"At each necropsy, significant gross lesions were not apparent although spleen and lymph nodes collected from pigs at days 7 and 10 PI looked edematous. Microscopically, nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis was observed in 5 of the 6 inoculated pigs (Fig. 4\\n). Nonsuppurative interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 5\\n) and nonsuppurative periportal hepatitis were other lesions commonly observed in the inoculated pigs. Neither gross nor microscopic lesions were present in tissues/organs of the control pig.\",\r\n        \"Virus X was recovered from tissues of all inoculated pigs regardless of the presence or absence of detectable lesions. Brain tissues from 4 of the 5 pigs with meningitis or encephalitis were positive for Virus X. The presence of virus particles with morphological characteristics similar to Virus X in brain tissues was confirmed by EM (Fig. 1). The virus was most frequently recovered from tonsils. Spleens and lymph nodes also harbored the virus.\",\r\n        \"Porcine reproductive and neurologic syndrome brought a challenge to the diagnostic community since no definitive diagnosis as to the cause could be made. Although death loss and reproductive failure in breeding females is not an unusual event in many farms for various reasons, clinical presentations of reproductive problems along with neurologic disorders were a unique feature of PRNS. Unfortunately, diagnostic investigations focusing on all conventional infectious agents that had been implicated in reproductive and/or neurologic problems of pigs at various ages has been unfruitful or yielded inconsistent results. With the hypothesis that a previously unknown infectious agent could be responsible for the disease, extensive laboratory testing resulted in frequent isolation of a relatively small enveloped cytopathic virus (‘Virus X’) from clinically affected animals. Although one might say that Virus X is not necessarily a causative pathogen, isolation of the virus from nervous tissues collected from clinically ill animals with CNS signs is a convincing evidence suggesting that Virus X was likely responsible for the disease. Observations from the animal inoculation study with pregnant sows clearly indicate that Virus X is capable of crossing the placental barrier and causing the loss of pregnancy most likely due to embryonic or fetal death as evident by recovery of the virus from fetal tissues. Furthermore, development of meningitis or encephalitis lesions in the brains of young CDCD pigs after inoculation with Virus X also indicate that the virus may be able to cause neurologic disorder in infected animals, although the inoculated CDCD pigs did not show clinical central nervous signs under experimental conditions. Those lesions were due to the attack by Virus X since the virus was recovered from brain tissues. Since all these experimental findings match well with field observations of PRNS, Virus X is postulated to be the causative agent for PRNS as Koch's postulates were partially fulfilled. It is proposed then that Virus X shall be named “PRNS virus (PRNSV)”.\",\r\n        \"Under a laboratory setting, PRNSV could not be readily recognized by antibodies raised against various viral agents that have been implicated in diseases of swine except anti-BVDV polyclonal antibody. The positive cross-reactivity of PRNSV with anti-BVDV antibody is of particular interest with respect to taxonomical identification of the virus. The possibility that PRNSV could be CSFV was ruled out at the beginning of the investigation since US swine populations are known to be free of CSFV. Furthermore, diagnostic testing on some early PRNS suspect cases at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory of the National Veterinary Laboratory Service ruled out the presence of CSFV or its infection in those animals as well as the involvement of other foreign animal disease agents (Data not shown). Pigs are known to be susceptible to ruminant pestiviruses such as BVDV and BDV besides porcine pestivirus (i.e., CSFV). Although BVDV infection of pigs has been demonstrated both in the field and under experimental conditions, BVDV has not been considered to be a significant pathogen for pigs. Considering that PRNSV is readily spread among pigs and there is very minimum contact between pigs and ruminants in the US, it would be hard to believe that PRNSV is BVDV or BDV. This argument is supported by negative PCR results (5′ UTR) on isolates of PRNSV for BVDV and CSFV. However, based on its morphological similarity with pestiviruses and cross-reactivity with anti-BVDV antibody, the possibility that PRNSV is a pestivirus cannot be completely ruled out until proven otherwise. At the time of writing this manuscript, PRNSV is proposed to be a novel swine pestivirus which remains to be further characterized for its conclusive taxonomical identification. As a pestivirus is suspected to be responsible for PRNS, development of a specific diagnostic reagent for PRNSV is prudent.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18406081/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508000904; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508000904\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7190306\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1016/s0140-6736(20)31023-0\",\r\n    title: \"Remdesivir for COVID-19: challenges of underpowered studies\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2020-04-29\",\r\n    authors: [\"John.Norrie\"],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\r\n        generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"In The Lancet, Yeming Wang and colleagues1 report a randomised trial of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10, in single daily infusions) versus placebo for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in ten hospitals in Wuhan, China. The authors report on 236 patients (140 [59%] men and 96 [41%] women; median age 65 years [IQR 56–71]), with inconclusive findings on the primary outcome of time to clinical improvement, defined as a two-point improvement on a 6-point ordinal scale,2 a hazard ratio of 1·23 (95% CI 0·87–1·75; favouring remdesivir), and median observation times of 21 days (IQR 13–28) in the remdesivir group versus 23 days (15–28) in the placebo group (a non-significant difference).\",\r\n        \"The study was well designed—a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised trial—and well conducted, with high protocol adherence and no loss to follow up. Randomised evidence was needed following high-profile publications on the first US COVID-19 case3 and the subsequent compassionate use of remdesivir in a 53-patient case series,4 which, coupled with in-vitro and animal model evidence, had generated high expectations of remdesivir efficacy.\",\r\n        \"Promising signals from observational data must be rigorously confirmed or refuted in high-quality randomised trials—particularly given that for COVID-19 no proven safe and effective treatments yet exist. Ideally, efficacy-based trials, including proof-of-mechanism studies, should precede larger pragmatic effectiveness trials.5 That is additionally challenging in a pandemic, and the temptation to lower the threshold of convincing evidence must be resisted, because adopting ineffective and potentially unsafe interventions risks only harm without worthwhile benefit, while making it even harder to undertake trials to find truly effective and safe interventions. We have already seen other drugs, repurposed for COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine6 and lopinavir–ritonavir,7 report disappointing findings so far in randomised trials after early promise.\",\r\n        \"Wang and colleagues' study1 stopped early after 237 of the intended 453 patients were enrolled, because by March 12 there were no further patients meeting eligibility criteria admitted in Wuhan. The study closed on March 29, having begun on Feb 6.\",\r\n        \"Here, stopping early gives an underpowered trial, which taken alone, gives inconclusive findings. The study has not shown a statistically significant finding that confirms a remdesivir treatment benefit of at least the minimally clinically important difference, nor has it ruled such a benefit out. The study sought a treatment effect of hazard ratio (HR) 1·40, translating to reducing median time to clinical improvement to 15 days (remdesivir) versus 21 days (placebo). The observed HR of 1·23 suggests that a benefit, if it exists, might be smaller than anticipated. This study is the first randomised trial of intravenous remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19, so it is difficult to know what the minimally clinically important difference is.8 That will depend on a complex reckoning of evidence for effectiveness, safety, acceptability, access, and cost. It is possible that even if the 453-patient target was reached, the study would have still been underpowered if a minimally clinically important difference of less than an HR of 1·4 was warranted.\",\r\n        \"However, likewise, a larger benefit might exist, or remdesivir might actually do harm. It is unknown—more data are needed. Fortunately, ClinicalTrials.gov indicates that five randomised trials involving remdesivir are recruiting globally, with one in severe COVID-19 from Gilead (NCT04292899), the drug manufacturer, with a target of 6000 participants; naively, this trial should be adequately powered.\",\r\n        \"In the meantime, how can the findings of Wang and colleagues be interpreted? The statistical reporting is clear, stating that the main findings were not statistically significant and acknowledging that the trial was underpowered (their post-hoc calculation indicated a power of 58% given the 236 participants with available data). However, a trial is not just its primary clinical outcome—there are important data on safety, viral load, and secondary outcomes. 22 (14%) of 158 patients on remdesivir died versus ten (13%) of 78 on placebo, and there was no signal that viral load decreased differentially over time between remdesivir and placebo groups. Furthermore, there were no differential signals on safety. Analyses were very similar under both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles.\",\r\n        \"\\n\\n\",\r\n        \"The authors also report primary outcome subgroup analyses. Only patients who were 12 days or less from illness onset were eligible overall, so a prespecified subgroup analysis investigated those who started study treatment up to 10 days versus more than 10 days (up to 12 days) from illness onset. Of course, even with an adequately powered study, subgroup analyses are generally not powered (and here, the 2:1 allocation further reduced power). There was no significant interaction of 10 days or less versus more than 10 days—ie, little support statistically of treatment effect moderation by time of initiation. Nor was either the 10 days or less or the more than 10 days within-subgroup treatment effects significant. Nonetheless, the authors give prominence to the 10 days or less subgroup, reporting a non-statistically significant HR of 1·52 (95% CI 0·95 to 2·43), median 18 days (IQR 12 to 28) versus 23 days (15 to 28), and a non-significant reduction in mortality (difference −3·6% [95% CI −16·2 to 8·9]). There was a possible baseline imbalance with 71 (45%) remdesivir patients versus 47 (60%) placebo patients in the 10 days or less subgroup, and possibly more patients with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease allocated to remdesivir than placebo, making interpretation even more difficult. Subgroup analyses, particularly for phase 3 confirmatory effectiveness trials, have justifiably been criticised9 and even ridiculed.10 Giving a subgroup analysis prominence over the primary analysis is unfortunately common. In early phase studies in a pandemic, little is known for certain, and it seems biologically plausible that treating patients earlier could be more effective. Nonetheless, as well as being vigilant against overinterpretation, we need to ensure that hypotheses generated in efficacy-based trials, even in subgroups, are confirmed or refuted in subsequent adequately powered trials or meta-analyses.\",\r\n        \"We have already seen how different interpretations will be put on these results, with the unintended early release of this study's results on the WHO website.11 This underlines how labelling of trials is mistaken as positive or negative—equating a p>0·05 with no evidence of benefit. There has been a welcome discussion of p value limitations recently.12 An absence of statistical significance in an underpowered trial means that the findings are inconclusive. The particular challenges of delivering pandemic trials underline the importance of data sharing, allowing rapid curation of relevant datasets for individual patient data meta-analyses.13 With each individual study at heightened risk of being incomplete, pooling data across possibly several underpowered but high-quality studies looks like our best way to obtain robust insights into what works, safely, and on whom.

It was an unusual sound that took months to be registered by astute clinicians and the public health system [1]. Today, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is widely recognized as a distinctive clinical entity; it is associated with a precipitous cardiorespiratory decomposition, thrombocytopenia, and atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear and is transmitted by rodents throughout the Americas [2]. The deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and Sin Nombre virus were quickly identified as the primary reservoir and etiological agent of disease, respectively, in the originally recognized outbreak in the southwestern United States [3] and, subsequently, in most of North America.\",\r\n        \"The initial recognition of HPS in the United States hinged on the combined employment of some classically trained virologists and the relatively new skills of molecular biologists at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories who had studied and refined diagnostic tests and treatments for hantaviruses of little relevance to the United States associated with Korean hemorrhagic fever and other hemorrhagic fevers with renal syndrome in Eurasia [4]. Their pioneering work led to a reclassification of hantaviruses into 2 distinct groups: (1) Old World hantaviruses, which are associated with renal syndrome, and (2) New World hantaviruses, which typically cause cardiopulmonary disease. The initial recognition in North America rapidly led to the description of numerous newly recognized viruses—in excess of 30 species—found throughout the Americas. New World hantaviruses are associated with a plethora of rodent host species in the sigmodontine subfamily, each with a unique rodent-virus species pairing. These viruses cause a spectrum of clinical illnesses designated as “new hantavirusassociated American hemorrhagic fever” and are thought to represent a coevolutionary relationship between New World rodents and their viruses [2, 3, 5, 6].\",\r\n        \"The recognition of HPS coincided with an Institute of Medicine report on emerging infections that warned about complacency toward infectious diseases in the era of improved sanitation and immunizations [7]. Similar international recognition of these microbial threats led to a global response that was accelerated after an anthrax bioterrorism incident in the United States and that served the world well for the response to severe acute respiratory syndrome [8].\",\r\n        \"Andes virus (ANDV)–associated HPS in Argentina and Chile has evidenced a unique predilection for limited person-toperson transmission. To date, there have been at least 6 reports supported by epidemiological and/or molecular data suggesting a potential for person-to-person transmission of ANDV [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The latest is the elegant study by Ferrés et al. [14] presented in this issue of the Journal; it prospectively followed 421 household contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed ANDV infection to test the hypothesis that ANDV retains the ability to be transmitted from person to person. The authors determined that sex partners of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases were at the greatest risk of infection, with an estimated secondary attack rate of 2.5% and detectable viremia 5–15 days before the onset of symptoms. The biological basis for person-to-person transmission of ANDV requires definitive characterization; however, ANDV is the only hantavirus that has been isolated from human serum and that consistently kills Syrian hamsters [15]. This evidence suggests that infection with ANDV results in a higher viral load [16] and perhaps that humans are a much more permissive host for this particular strain than for other hantaviruses. The data suggest that person-toperson transmission is the result of direct contact during the preclinical phase of infection (which is consistent with the timing of viremia) and that the disease is most likely to have an incubation period of 2– 4 weeks and to occur after contact with subsequently severely ill patients. It also explains the paucity of nosocomial transmission, because contact with health care workers is likely to occur much later, during the clinical phase of infection.\",\r\n        \"We are becoming ever more cognizant that the vast majority of emerging pathogens have zoonotic origins [17]. Through limited person-to-person transmission events, some of these pathogens may be able to establish themselves in a new permissive host or vector. HIV, influenza virus, measles virus, Plasmodium falciparum, and smallpox virus—all pathogens hypothesized to be of zoonotic origin—are but a few examples of human pathogens arising from evolutionary events across millennia. [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Human dengue and urban yellow fever may be examples of a new reservoir allowing sustained person-to-person transmission [23]. Limited person-to-person transmission also characterizes the current panzoonotic H5N1 strain of influenza virus, for which there has been intense scrutiny of the biological mechanism that enables human transmission.\",\r\n        \"Global pandemic influenza preparedness illustrates a unique challenge for the public health system: responding to diseases that result from the intersection of animals, humans, and the environment. Success will require coordination between the animal and human health sectors [24, 25]. The ongoing H5N1 epizootic, the Rift Valley fever outbreaks in eastern Africa, and the monkeypox outbreak in the United States have illustrated that need. This is an area that has been woefully neglected to date. As the world's population continues to grow, interactions between humans and novel pathogens are likely to increase, resulting in greater numbers of emerging and reemerging diseases [26]. To help understand the ecologies of infectious diseases, the DHHS/CDC, in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and numerous ministries of health, is currently establishing Global Disease Detection (GDD) centers in 5 of the 6 WHO regions across the globe. These GDD centers will work in concert with the DoD–Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) centers as partners within the WHO–Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN).

Of these, 50 were hospitalized and 61 were treated as outpatients. Thirty-three of 50 inpatients (66%) received at least 1 day of systemic corticosteroids compared with three of 61 (5%) outpatients. The analysis of immunologic and virologic changes associated with systemic corticosteroid use was restricted to the hospitalized cohort to provide more balanced illness severity in the comparison groups. Although a variety of steroid regimens were prescribed, most patients received 4 to 10 mg of dexamethasone or 40 to 60 mg of methylprednisolone every 6 h for 1 to 2 days followed by an oral prednisone taper. The mean duration of steroid therapy was 11.3 ± 7.3 days with a range from 1 to 27 days. Five subjects received 2 or fewer days of corticosteroid treatment. Seven subjects were taking oral corticosteroids prior to admission, and all were given IV corticosteroids or higher doses of oral prednisone treatment while hospitalized.\",\r\n        \"Predictably, the clinical features of the subjects who received corticosteroids were different from those who were not treated (Table 1\\n). Although most differences did not achieve statistical significance, those given steroids in the hospital were more often men with a history of COPD and were receiving oral steroids and supplemental oxygen prior to admission. The presence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease was slightly more common among those not treated with corticosteroids. Admitting diagnoses were similar between the two groups, although COPD exacerbation was most common among those treated with steroids, and a diagnosis of pneumonia was the leading diagnosis for those not treated. Wheezing at the time of admission was more common in the steroid group, whereas the patients not treated with steroids patients were more often febrile. Although not significantly different, there was a trend toward higher rates of infiltrates on chest radiographs and mean peripheral WBC counts in those not treated with steroids.\",\r\n        \"Overall, the hospital course for patients who received corticosteroids was similar to those who were not treated (Table 2\\n). Rates of respiratory failure, intensive care admission, and in-hospital mortality were not significantly different. Two patients in the steroid-treated group died, and in both cases patients were placed on hospice care because of longstanding severe COPD. No patients developed nosocomial bacterial infections, and there were no overt complications related to steroid treatment, such as psychosis or severe glucose dysregulation. Although the mean last days of reported wheezing or dyspnea were significantly longer in the steroid-treated group compared with those not treated, the length of hospital stay and illness duration were not significantly different.\",\r\n        \"Group A and B viruses were evenly distributed in those treated with steroids vs those who were not treated. Viral shedding was not prolonged, nor was the mean viral load higher in the steroid-treated group (Figs 1A, 1B\\n). Inflammatory mediators were measured in nasal samples at enrollment, day 12, and day 28 and were not consistently different in either group (Table 3\\n). There was a trend toward lower acute serum IL-6 levels in patients treated with steroids compared with those not treated (5.4 ± 8.5 vs 17.2 ± 34.4, P = .08). Of note, blood samples were collected on average 2 days after steroids were begun. By day 28, serum IL-6 levels were similar in both groups.\",\r\n        \"RSV-specific serum and nasal antibody titers measured at the time of enrollment were not significantly different between groups. Serum and nasal antibody responses to RSV infection were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group (Figs 2A, 2B\\n) with convalescent titers approximately twofold lower compared with the untreated group. However, only serum-neutralizing antibody responses to group A virus (P = .05) and nasal IgA to the fusion protein (P = .01) were significantly lower.\",\r\n        \"Twenty-nine randomly selected subjects (16 steroid treated and 13 untreated) had T and B lymphocyte subpopulations analyzed at three time points: acute (∼ 36-48 h after initiating steroids), day 12 to 14, and day 28 post illness. Admission absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) prior to steroid administration were similar (1.1 ± 0.5 × 103/μL vs 1.2 ± 0.7 × 103/μL) in the steroid-treated and -untreated groups, respectively. Notably, 31% of the steroid-treated group (of whom two were receiving steroids prior to admission) and 46% of the untreated group had an ALC of < 1.0 × 103/μL at presentation to the hospital. For those receiving steroids who had repeat measurements, the mean ALC was 0.8 ± 0.5 × 103/μL at 24 h, 1.2 ± 0.7 × 103/μL between days 2 and 6, and 1.2 ± 0.4 × 103/μL after day 9.\",\r\n        \"Representative flow cytometry results are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4\\nfor a random subset of 35 and 23 patients for T- and B-cell panels, respectively, at the mid time point (day 8-14). Analysis of early and late testing demonstrated similar findings in B- and T-cell subsets (data not shown). A representative sample of B- and T-cell subsets is shown in e-Figure 1A and 1B. No significant differences between steroid-treated and steroid-untreated subjects at any of the time points were noted regarding the total percentage of B cells (% CD19+), CD27+ memory B cells, antibody secreting cells (ASC), or plasmablasts (Fig 3). Additionally, there were no significant differences in the fraction of CD3+ T cells, monocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells (naive and memory), and natural killer cells (subsets of CD56+CD16hi and CD56hi) (Fig 4).\",\r\n        \"In our study of patients hospitalized with RSV-related respiratory illness, short-term systemic corticosteroids were not associated with significant adverse clinical or virologic outcomes. No episodes of severe hyperglycemia, avascular bone necrosis, or steroid-induced psychosis were observed during the hospitalization or 1-month follow-up period. However, it is important to note that our study was not powered to detect important clinical steroid-related adverse events. Given the importance of cellular immunity for viral clearance and the recognized effects of long-term steroid use, we were surprised that peak RSV viral loads and duration of viral shedding were not increased in the steroid-treated group.20 This finding may reflect the relatively brief course of systemic steroids received by study participants. Although steroids exert an antiinflammatory effect, no uniform trend was detected in serum or nasal cytokine levels in patients receiving steroids.\",\r\n        \"The complex quantitative and qualitative effects of systemic glucocorticosteroids on the host immune response are well described.21 Nearly every type of immune cell, including B and T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, are affected. A substantial reduction in circulating lymphocytes can be demonstrated almost immediately upon injection of hydrocortisone in animal studies, with no further effect of increased dose or duration.22 Lymphopenia is reversible but lasts throughout the period of exposure. Steroids also inhibit T-cell activation, lymphocyte proliferation, and T helper 1/T helper 2 regulation.21 Given the known effects of steroids on the immune system, the lack of significant differences in lymphocyte numbers and subsets in our steroid-treated subjects is puzzling. However, very few data are available on the immune affects of steroids in acutely ill patients, particularly those with viral infections. Lymphopenia is associated with a number of acute viral infections, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.23, 24 It is noteworthy that many of the patients in this study were lymphopenic at the time of presentation, and thus it is possible that RSV infection induces significant immunologic perturbations that may complicate interpretation of a steroid effect.\",\r\n        \"The primary adverse effect of steroid use appeared to be a modestly diminished serum and secretory antibody response. Although differences were only statistically significant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded significant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specific protective antibody titer is not known.19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these findings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a significant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specific T-cell responses or ASC, which may have been preferentially affected by steroid administration.\",\r\n        \"Our study is limited by the small sample size, the lack of randomization, and the restriction to one type of viral infection. Because steroids were more commonly used in patients with COPD, which is an inflammatory condition, the effects of steroids on inflammatory markers and immune function may have been difficult to discern given the unequal distribution of patients with COPD in the analysis groups. Although it is reasonable to presume steroid effects would be similar for other respiratory viruses, RSV has unique immunomodulatory effects, and, therefore, our findings may not be broadly applicable.26, 27, 28\\n\",\r\n        \"In conclusion, a short course of systemic corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with acute RSV infection was not associated with major deleterious side effects. Since specific respiratory viral infections, with the exception of influenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassuring. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinflammatory effects and potential clinical benefits.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21565965/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369211605801; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369211605801; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3205848?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.11-0047\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7138107\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68624-8\",\r\n    title: \"Poliomyelitis eradication and pandemic influenza\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2006-05-04\",\r\n    authors: [\"David.Heymann\", \"R.Aylward\"],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\r\n        generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"When an outbreak of febrile haemorrhagic disease first occurred in the Ulge Province of Angola in November, 2004, it was the poliomyelitis surveillance officer in that province who did the initial case investigation, collected blood specimens, and ensured that those specimens were sent to a WHO Collaborating Centre for Haemorrhagic Fevers.1 After the diagnosis of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, the poliomyelitis surveillance officers provided logistic support to the national and international team that implemented containment activities, which included case finding, contact tracing, case management and infection control in adapted isolation facilities, on-site laboratory diagnosis, safe burial, and social mobilisation. In addition, all 65 poliomyelitis eradication officers in Angola, of whom six are international and the rest nationals, organised mobile teams for active surveillance in provinces at risk outside the outbreak zone to investigate and report suspect cases.\",\r\n        \"These poliomyelitis surveillance officers are part of a worldwide system for surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis that identifies, investigates, and collects specimens each year from over 60 000 paralysed children under the age of 15 years in more than 190 countries.2 The system is supported by the poliomyelitis eradication partners—Rotary International, UNICEF, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO—through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). This system, which is constantly monitored for performance against international surveillance standards, provides a structure for rapidly detecting and responding to diseases of national and international importance, and in some resource-poor countries in Africa and south Asia is the most reliable surveillance and response mechanism available.\",\r\n        \"Poliomyelitis surveillance officers also support countries in planning, social mobilisation, and implementation of poliovirus vaccination campaigns; and they train school teachers and community volunteers to participate in vaccination campaigns along with health workers.

They must be reaccredited every 1–2 years to remain in the network, and are distributed around the world (figure\\n).\",\r\n        \"There are 279 international and 2964 national GPEI-funded poliomyelitis eradication staff in over 50 countries with or at risk of wild poliovirus infection (table\\n). These staff are concentrated in areas with the weakest health systems. Mainly because of financing constraints, the number of GPEI-funded surveillance officers is systematically reduced as countries are certified poliomyelitis-free, with some transferred to other international funding sources (eg, for activities to reduce measles mortality) or national government service. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers are usually medical epidemiologists who have been specially trained in poliomyelitis surveillance, case investigation and outbreak response, and are equipped with computers, transport, and real-time communication capacity through cell or satellite phones.\",\r\n        \"In over 125 countries, the epidemiological and laboratory capacities have been broadened to include diseases such as measles, yellow fever, the haemorrhagic fevers, meningitis, and Japanese encephalitis.4 The network has also been mobilised to support countries during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Most recently, capacities have been broadened to include avian influenza. For example, in Kaduna State in Nigeria, poliomyelitis surveillance officers provided key messages about avian influenza to community leaders during poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns in early February, and poliomyelitis surveillance officers are now providing such messages throughout Nigeria. Poliomyelitis surveillance officers in Maharashtra State in India have been asked to report any information they obtain on sick or dying poultry to federal health authorities.\",\r\n        \"Further broadening the epidemiological capacities of poliomyelitis surveillance officers by providing training in influenza can substantially enhance surveillance and investigation of severe respiratory disease in human beings living in areas where there are lethal outbreaks in poultry and, potentially, assist in the early detection of avian disease. Broadening the laboratory capacity to include diagnosis of H5N1 where feasible could provide wider support to the influenza-laboratory network. Should there be a need for rapid and effective social mobilisation and distribution of antiviral drugs or eventually vaccines, the capacity of the poliomyelitis eradication officers to ensure access is proven.\",\r\n        \"External support for national poliomyelitis surveillance is presently borne entirely by GPEI, with about US$100 million in annual funding from donor countries, multilateral institutions, foundations, and Rotary International. Broadening the funding base for this unique international public-health surveillance and laboratory network could maintain its geographical distribution and ensure a stronger response capacity for any national or international pandemic of influenza. To ignore this dividend of the 20-year international investment in poliomyelitis eradication will increase vulnerability to avian influenza in countries where health systems are weakest and least able

Trotz eines z. T. sehr auffälligen Röntgenbildes bleiben 60 % der Patienten asymptomatisch [2]. Eine radiologische Stadieneinteilung anhand des Röntgenbildes wurde von Scadding et al. bereits im Jahr 1961 etabliert. Diese wird teilweise auch heute noch verwendet, obwohl sie wissenschaftlich nicht mehr aktuell ist, sich das Ausmaß der Erkrankung nicht alleine durch das konventionelle Röntgenbild beurteilen lässt und der teilweise in Bezug auf die Prognose signifikantere extrapulmonale Befall hierdurch nicht abgebildet wird (▶Tab. 1).\",\r\n        \"Manifestationen, die in der CT, aber nicht in der\\nThoraxübersicht erkennbar sind, werden in dieser Stadieneinteilung nicht berücksichtigt. Die CT hilft v. a. bei unklaren klinischen und/oder radiologischen Befunden [43], bei begründetem klinischem Verdacht auf Sarkoidose und gleichzeitigem Vorliegen eines unauffälligen Röntgenbildes und bei der Detektion von Komplikationen der pulmonalen Erkrankung [3].\",\r\n        \"Eine nachgewiesene extrapulmonale Beteiligung bei Sarkoidose besteht in ca. 30 % der Fälle. Dabei ist am häufigsten ein abdomineller Befall bei bis zu 70 % der Patienten mit extrapulmonalen Manifestationen. Die Leber ist in bis zu 80 % dieser Fälle betroffen, dabei handelt es sich um Hepatomegalie, multiple hypodense, teils konfluierende Noduli, Zeichen der portalen Hypertension und der Leberzirrhose oder eine Pfortaderthrombose. Eine Milzbeteiligung besteht in 23–54 % der Fälle; in 30 % der Fälle mit abdomineller Beteiligung zeigt sich eine Lymphadenopathie, v. a. im Bereich der Leberpforte, paraaortal und um den Truncus coeliacus [4]. Weitere wichtige extrapulmonale Manifestationen der Sarkoidose betreffen Haut (25 %), Herz (5–10 %), Augen 25 %, zentrales Nervensystem (5 %) und selten Nieren [5, 6].\",\r\n        \"Typisch für das radiologische Stadium I und II ist die bihiläre Lymphadenopathie (▶Abb. 1). Die Lymphknoten zeigen in der Regel keine Zeichen einer Nekrose sowie keine relevanten raumfordernden Effekte [44]. Kavernen sind selten (▶Abb. 2). Bei langem Krankheitsverlauf können sie Verkalkungen aufweisen [7]; in der MRT kann schon früh ein Schießscheibenzeichen der Lymphknoten erkennbar sein (▶Abb. 3; [8]). Umgekehrt ist eine bihiläre Lymphadenopathie selten bösartig (in 3,8 % der Fälle liegt ein malignes Lymphom vor, in 0,8 % ein Bronchialkarzinom, in 0,2 % extrathorakale Malignome [9]).\",\r\n        \"Die häufigste pulmonale Manifestation der Sarkoidose sind Mikronoduli und Noduli mit einem Durchmesser von 1–10 mm und unscharfer Begrenzung. Diese haben eine „random“, d. h. eine „zufällige“ Verteilung, also sowohl zentrilobulär als auch perilymphatisch, wobei letzteres richtungsweisend für eine Sarkoidose spricht. Typischerweise liegt eine Betonung der Mittel- und Oberfelder vor. Dichteanhebung und irregulärer Verlauf der bronchovaskulären Bündel werden häufig beobachtet. Oft konfluieren mehrere Mikronoduli zu einem größeren Knoten >10 mm, umgeben von zahlreichen kleinen, satellitenartig angeordneten Mikronoduli, von Nakatsu [10] mit dem Begriff „sarcoid galaxy“ bezeichnet (▶Abb. 1). Konsolidierungen mit oder ohne Bronchopneumogramm treten bei 12–38 % der Patienten auf [2]. Retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung sowie Milchglasinfiltrate kommen ebenso vor und sind ein Hinweis auf den Übergang der Erkrankung in eine fibrosierende Form (▶Abb. 4).\",\r\n        \"Im radiologischen Stadium IV stehen fibrotische Veränderungen im Vordergrund. Es zeigen sich Deformierungen und Distorsionen der Bronchien, Konsolidierungen, Rundherde, retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung, seltener Traktionsbronchiektasen (38 %), Honigwabenmuster (32 %) v. a. in den Oberlappen, Emphysem (12 %) und Zysten (19 %) [11]. Dabei kann sich ein das Muster einer gewöhnlichen interstitiellen Pneumonie (UIP) ergeben, welches aufgrund seiner apikalen Betonung von dem für eine idiopathische pulmonale Fibrose (IPF) typischen UIP-Muster mit basaler Betonung manchmal unterschieden werden kann (▶Abb. 4) [45].\",\r\n        \"Die Bildgebung spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Diagnosestellung. In den etablierten Diagnosekriterien der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin (DGP) und der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Allergologie und Klinische Immunologie (DGAKI) für akute/subakute EAA werden Röntgen- und, sofern vorhanden, Dünnschicht-CT-Zeichen einer EAA gefordert. So ist ein entsprechender radiologischer Befund in der Dünnschicht-CT eines der Diagnosekriterien für eine chronische EAA [12]. Je nach Stadium sind unterschiedliche Befunde zu erwarten: Die Thoraxübersicht ist bei der akuten EAA in 20–30 % der Fälle unauffällig [13]. In den restlichen Fällen zeigen sich beidseitige interstitielle Infiltrate, meist unter Aussparung der kostophrenischen Winkel. Bei der chronischen EAA sind retikuläre und noduläre Zeichnungsvermehrungen zu erwarten, v. a. im mittleren und apikalen Feld, ggf. auch Zeichen eines Emphysems oder eines Cor pulmonale. Die Dünnschicht-CT ist damit der diagnostische Standard bei Verdacht auf eine EAA, gerade auch bei unauffälliger Thoraxübersichtsaufnahme [40].\",\r\n        \"Im akuten und subakuten Stadium ist ein diffuses Milchglasmuster v. a. in Mittel- und Unterfeldern zu erwarten (▶Abb. 5). Bei der subakuten Form zeigen sich zusätzlich auch unscharf begrenzte, „wattebauschartige“ zentrilobuläre Knötchen sowie ein Mosaikmuster durch „airtrapping“ bei Bronchiolitis der terminalen Bronchiolen. Letzteres kann in der Exspirations-CT deutlicher gesehen werden.\",\r\n        \"Die Kombination von Milchglasinfiltraten und Mosaikmuster bezeichnet man als „head cheese sign“ („Presskopfzeichen“), d. h. das benachbarte Auftreten lobulärer Areale mit erniedrigter, normaler und angehobener Dichte. Früher wurde dies als ein hochspezifisches radiologisches Zeichen der EAA gedeutet, mittlerweile ist es aber auch bei weiteren Erkrankungen beschrieben worden, wie u. a. bei Infektionen mit Bronchiolitis (z. B. Virus-, Chlamydien- oder Mykoplasmenpneumonie), Sarkoidose, respiratorischer Bronchiolitis mit interstitieller Lungenerkrankung (RB-ILD [14]). Im Falle eines gleichzeitigen Auftretens von Milchglas, Knötchen und Mosaikmuster sowie passender Anamnese und Klinik besteht eine hohe Spezifität für die Diagnose einer EAA [13].\",\r\n        \"Eine radiologische und klinische Herausforderung ist die chronische EAA. Dabei ist eine Überlappung der Befunde zum akuten und subakuten Stadium möglich. Es finden sich v. a. retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrung in Mittel- und Oberfeldern, zentrilobuläre Knötchen, Milchglas sowie Mosaikmuster. Bei der fortgeschrittenen EAA kommt es oft zu Traktionsbronchiektasen, Volumenminderung, Verdickung von Interlobulärsepten und fibrotischem Umbau mit Honigwabenmuster, sodass ein radiologisches UIP-Muster möglich ist. Die zentrilobulären Noduli der Frühphasen können fehlen, was die differenzialdiagnostische Abgrenzung zur idiopathischen Lungenfibrose erschwert. Ebenso ist eine idiopathische nichtspezifische interstitieller Pneumonie (NSIP) als Differenzialdiagnose möglich (▶Abb. 6; [15]). Eine Untersuchung von Silva [16] hat folgende wesentliche Unterschiede einer chronischen EAA im Vergleich zu IPF hervorgehoben: Bei der EAA zeigen sich signifikant öfter lobuläre Areale mit Dichteminderung weniger in den Unterfeldern, sondern v. a. in den Mittel- und Oberfeldern mit zentrilobulären Noduli. Auch „airtrapping“, nachgewiesen durch zusätzliche Aufnahmen in Exspiration, war signifikant häufiger bei einer chronischen EAA zu sehen (75 %) als bei IPF (35 %) oder NSIP (10 %). Als Besonderheit der chronischen EAA bei einer Farmerlunge ist die höhere Prävalenz von Emphysemen zu nennen [17]. Zusammenfassend kann eine Abgrenzung zu den Differenzialdiagnosen nur im interdisziplinären Kontext erfolgen.\",\r\n        \"Die typischen pulmonalen Manifestationen betreffen sowohl das Tracheobronchialsystem als auch das Lungenparenchym. Tracheobronchial kommt es in 10–30 % der Fälle zu Stenosierungen, oft an mehreren Lokalisationen [13]; am häufigsten ist dabei die subglottische Trachealstenose. Ferner treten Schleimhautnekrosen an den unteren Atemwegen auf, aus denen oft Stenosen, postobstruktive Infektionen und inflammatorische Pseudotumoren hervorgehen. Darüber hinaus kommt es manchmal zur tracheobronchialen Malazie, ösophagobronchialen Fisteln und Bronchiektasen. Der Trachealbefall kann uni- oder multifokal sein und ist im Mittel 2–4 cm lang. Charakteristisch ist der Befall der gesamten Trachea inklusive ihrer Hinterwand (Pars membranacea), die bei anderen Erkrankungen oft ausgespart bleibt.\",\r\n        \"Die häufigste Veränderung (Prävalenz von 70 %) in der CT ist der Rundherd im Lauf der Erkrankung [18] mit Neigung zur zentralen Nekrose (in 50 % der Fälle, v. a. bei Knoten >2 cm) und Kavernenbildung (▶Abb. 7). Diese können sich rasch entwickeln und auf die Thoraxwand übergreifen. Ein Halozeichen zeigt sich dabei in 15 % der Fälle, seltener ein Reverse-Halo- oder Atollzeichen. Die Rundherde haben eine variable Verteilung, häufig bestehen auch wechselnde Infiltrate. Oft beobachtet man ohne adäquate Therapie eine Kavernenbildung, unter Behandlung dagegen können Kavernen ausheilen und plattenartige Vernarbungen ausbilden. Knoten, die nicht mit klinischer oder serologischer Aktivität der Erkrankung korrelieren und größenprogredient sind, sollten aufgrund des zweifach erhöhten Malignitätsrisikos bei der GPA invasiv abgeklärt werden [18, 19]. Ebenso kann es im Rahmen der Vaskulitis zur Kapillaritis im Lungenparenchym kommen. Eine alveoläre Hämorrhagie tritt dann bei ca. 10 % der Patienten mit Kapillaritis auf [13]. Bei einer akuten alveolären Hämorrhagie zeigen sich Milchglasinfiltrate. Bei rezidivierenden Blutungen können auch retikuläre Zeichnungsvermehrungen, ein peripheres Honigwabenmuster und Traktionsbronchiektasen entstehen [20].\",\r\n        \"Sowohl bei bei GPA als auch viel häufiger bei MPA ist die Entwicklung einer Fibrose mit UIP-Muster, seltener mit NSIP-Muster, möglich und kann anderen klinischen Manifestationen der Vaskulitis vorausgehen [21, 22]. Nebenbefundlich werden Pleuraergüsse in bis zu 20 % der Fälle beobachtet, entweder als Zeichen des Pleurabefalls oder als hydropische Dekompensationszeichen bei Nierenbefall. Selten zeigen sich auch mediastinale Lymphknotenvergrößerungen (▶Abb. 8).\",\r\n        \"Die Erkrankung kann in zwei verschiedenen Formen auftreten: die akute und die klassische Silikose. Die wichtigste Ursache für die akute Silikose ist eine massive Exposition gegenüber auslösenden Noxen. Es kommt zu einem frühen Erkrankungsbeginn innerhalb von 2 Jahren. Die akute Silikose manifestiert sich in der Regel klinisch und radiologisch als eine Alveolitis. Radiologisch kommen in der Thoraxübersicht diffuse, beidseitige, basale alveoläre Infiltrate, in der CT beidseitige Milchglasinfiltrate bei gefüllten Alveolen (histologisch einer alveolären Silikoproteinose entsprechend) zur Darstellung. Der Verlauf zeichnet sich durch frühen Progress zum Lungenversagen und die schlechte Prognose aus.\",\r\n        \"Die klassische Silikose tritt in der Regel länger als 5 Jahre nach Staubexposition auf und führt zu einer langsam progredienten Lungenfunktionseinschränkung, wobei verschiedene Komplikationen an anderen Organsystemen möglich sind. Hierbei gehen die radiologischen Manifestationen in der Regel den klinischen und funktionellen Veränderungen voraus. Die Grundlage der radiologischen Diagnostik bildet die Thoraxübersicht. Dort zeigen sich in der Regel ein feinretikuläres Muster mit kleinen Fleckschatten, disseminierte Noduli in den Ober- und Mittelfeldern, oft zentrale Verkalkungen sowie Verschmelzung zu irregulären Konglomeraten von 1 cm bis zu Lappengröße in den Mittelfeldern und pleurale Schwielenbildung (▶Abb. 9). Eine Höhlenbildung in Konglomeratknoten ist aufgrund oben genannter Nekrosen möglich. Oft zu erkennen ist ein kompensatorisches (Narben-)Emphysem mit Überblähung und Bullae neben Konglomeraten (▶Abb. 10). Die Hiluslymphknoten sind vergrößert mit peripherer eierschalenartiger Verkalkung [25].\",\r\n        \"Die radiologischen Befunde der Silikose werden nach der International Labour Organization (ILO) klassifiziert. Dort werden „kleine Schatten“ auf dem Lungenbild mit rundlicher, unregelmäßiger und gemischter Form ebenso erwähnt wie „große Schatten“. Die Klassifikation erfolgt anhand von Größe, Form, Ausdehnung/Streuung und befallenen Feldern. Bezüglich der Pleura gehen diffuse Verdickungen, Pleuraplaques und die Adhärenz des kostophrenischen Winkels in die Bewertung ein [26]. Selten ist der Einsatz einer Dünnschicht-CT nötig, empfohlen wird dies laut der aktuellen S2-Leitlinie bei fortwährender diagnostischer Unsicherheit nach einer Zweitbegutachtung der Röntgenübersicht im Rahmen der Diagnostik der Berufskrankheit. Die CT soll in Low-dose-Technik und nach standardisierten Vorgaben erfolgen [27].\",\r\n        \"Das Risiko für das Auftreten eines Bronchialkarzinoms, einer Tuberkulose (in diesem Fall Silikotuberkulose) und einer Kollagenose ist bei Silikosepatienten erhöht. Ebenso besteht eine gesteigerte Infektanfälligkeit, sodass opportunistische Infektionen, u. a. invasive Mykosen, ebenso gehäuft auftreten. Daher kann insbesondere bei akut kranken Patienten oder inkonklusiver Röntgenübersicht die CT von hoher klinisch-diagnostischer Bedeutung sein [28, 29].\",\r\n        \"Bei der Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose (LCH) handelt es sich um eine seltene Erkrankung, die sowohl als klonale, generalisierte Form im Kindes- und Jugendalter als auch lokalisiert und im Erwachsenenalter auftreten kann. Hier wird über die diffuse pulmonale Verlaufsform des Erwachsenen berichtet (pLCH). Die pLCH tritt bei Rauchern auf und geht mit einer Proliferation der Langerhans-Zellen in den Atemwegen einher. Histologisch zeigen sich Granulome mit Langerhans-Zellen und eosinophilen Granulozyten. Das konventionelle Röntgenbild ist in der Regel nicht diagnostisch. In der hochauflösenden („high resolution“, HR) Dünnschicht-CT sieht man oft das pathognomonische „Schrotschussmuster“: Irregulär verteilte, die ganze Lunge betreffende, unscharf begrenzte zentrilobuläre Noduli (1–5 mm im Durchmesser), selten größere Noduli mit Durchmesser >10 mm, die teils zentral einschmelzen können, sowie begleitende zystische Läsionen (▶Abb. 11). Die Zysten sind oft kleiner als 2 cm, unregelmäßig, zu Beginn dick- und im späteren Stadium der Erkrankung dünnwandig (Wanddicke <1 mm). Ober- und Mittelfelder sind vermehrt betroffen, die Herde sind wahllos vom Zentrum nach außen verteilt. Selten treten Milchglasinfiltrate und eine paratracheale und mediastinale Lymphadenopathie auf [30]. Das charakteristische CT-Bild erlaubt bei einem Raucher im jüngeren Alter auch ohne eine bioptische Sicherung bei Fehlen sonstiger Pathologien die Diagnose einer Langerhans-Zell-Histiozytose [30, 31].\",\r\n        \"Unter den infektiösen Granulomatosen sind an erster Stelle die Tuberkulose und die nicht tuberkulösen Mykobakteriosen zu erwähnen [48].\",\r\n        \"Eine immer noch große Rolle bei Screening, Erstdiagnose und Verlaufskontrolle der Tuberkulose spielt das konventionelle Röntgenbild [32]. Die CT besitzt jedoch sowohl eine höhere Sensitivität (bis zu 91 %) als auch einen höheren negativen prädiktiven Wert (bis zu 76 % [33]). Eine höhere Sensitivität zeigt sich insbesondere bei kleinen Befunden oder beim Nachweis von Komplikationen [39, 41]. In den seltenen Fällen einer chirurgischen Therapienotwendigkeit ist eine CT in der Planung unverzichtbar [42, 49, 52].\",\r\n        \"Bezüglich Nomenklatur, Einteilung, Diagnostik und mögliche Manifestationen der Tuberkulose verweisen wir auf den gleichnamigen Artikel von Kienzl-Palma in Radiologe 2016;56:866–73. DOI 10.1007/s00117-016-0166-y.\",\r\n        \"Die nicht tuberkulösen Mykobakteriosen (NTM) umfassen eine Gruppe von Erkrankungen, die von Mykobakterien verursacht werden, die nicht dem Mycobacterium-tuberculosis-Komplex und nicht M. leprae zugerechnet werden. Die Erreger sind in verschiedenen Umweltbereichen weit verbreitet. Oft handelt es sich um Patienten mit HIV-Infektion, Immunsuppression oder solche mit einer pulmonalen Grunderkrankung. Die Klinik ist unspezifisch und besteht v. a. in produktivem Husten, Hämoptysen, Fieber und Gewichtsverlust. Die Lunge ist das Hauptmanifestationsorgan, aber auch diverse extrapulmonale Manifestationen mit entsprechender Klinik sind möglich [34].\",\r\n        \"Radiologisch lassen sich 2 Formen unterscheiden: die fibrokavernöse Form, CT-morphologisch der Tbc ähnlich, sowie eine nodulär bronchiektatische Form. Eine Überlappung ist möglich. Dabei spielt die Thoraxübersicht eine wichtige Rolle als Basisdiagnostik; die CT kann besondere Pathologien wie z. B. Bronchiektasien und Kavernen besser darstellen (▶Abb. 12 und ▶Abb. 13).\",\r\n        \"Charakteristische Befunde bei NTM sind flächige Infiltrate, Kavernen mit verdickten Wänden, Bronchiektasen mit umgebenden Infiltraten, disseminierte kleinfleckige Infiltrate sowie Lymphknotenvergrößerungen [34]. Eine sichere radiologische Unterscheidung von einer Tuberkulose ist nicht möglich. Nur wenige radiologische Befunde sind bei der NTM häufiger als bei der Tbc. Eine solche Zusammenstellung kann man zum Beispiel bei Yuan [35] finden, die 95 CT-Thorax-Untersuchungen von Patienten mit positivem Sputumbefund verglichen hat (▶Tab. 2).\",\r\n        \"Differenzialdiagnostisch kommen z.

This flock has no prior exposure to swine or to PDCoV, PEDV, or TGEV. After acclimating in Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) facilities for 1 day, all birds appeared healthy with no evidence of diarrhea or other clinical signs. Animal protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.\",\r\n        \"We determined PDCoV titers from intestinal contents of pigs by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay (23). We seeded LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cells at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate (BD Biosciences, https://www.bdbiosciences.com). We washed 100% confluent monolayers once with 200 µL of maintenance media (MM): minimal essential media (MEM), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), GlutaMAX (GIBCO, https://www.thermofisher.com) consisting of MEM with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% HEPES. We inoculated 100 µL from 10-fold dilutions of PDCoV in 8 replicates per dilution. Each plate included 1 row of negative control MM only with 5 µg/mL of Trypsin (Corning, https://www.corning.com). After absorption for 1 h, we added another 100 µL of MM with 5 µg/mL of Trypsin to each well. We monitored cytopathic effects for 3–7 days, calculated virus titers after immunofluorescent (IF) staining by using the Reed-Muench method (24), and expressed results as log10 TCID50/mL (23).\",\r\n        \"Birds were floor housed in a temperature-controlled BSL-2 containment room with wood litter shavings and provided ad libitum access to food and water. In consecutive experiments of poults and chicks, we randomly divided the flock of 25 birds into 2 groups, 15 uninfected and 10 infected birds. Each group was housed separately and inoculated through the choanal cleft. The uninfected group was inoculated with 200 µL of unfiltered, undiluted small intestine contents (SIC) from an uninfected gnotobiotic pig (GP-8). The infected group was inoculated with SIC from a PDCoV-infected pig (DC175) with 6.87 log10 TCID50/mL.

At 2 days postinoculation (dpi), we randomly assigned 5 birds from each uninfected group as sentinels and allowed them to comingle with the infected group for the duration of the experiment. We recorded body weights and collected cloacal swab, tracheal swab, and serum samples at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. Except for sentinel birds, we euthanized 2 chicks and 2 poults from each group at 3 and 7 dpi for blood and tissue collection.

We added 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (SureBlue TMB 1-Component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate; Seracare, https://www.seracare.com), then added 100 µL of 0.3 mol/L sulfuric acid to stop the reaction. We read plates at an absorbance of 450 nm by using a SpectraMax F5 (Molecular Devices, https://www.moleculardevices.com) plate reader.

By 14 dpi, most (5/6) of the remaining infected chicks had normal feces. The 5 uninfected sentinel chicks that comingled with the infected birds at 2 dpi demonstrated mild to moderate diarrhea 2 days after comingling (4 dpi); diarrhea peaked 5 days after comingling (7 dpi). At 14 dpi, only 2 sentinel chicks had abnormal feces. Two chicks in the uninfected group had transient diarrhea during the study but tested negative for known pathogens, including PDCoV.\",\r\n        \"In poults, 50% exhibited diarrhea at 2 dpi. During the study, the rate of diarrhea increased, and poults did not recover by 14 dpi. (Table 1). Sentinel poults began exhibiting mild to moderate diarrhea 5 days after comingling (7 dpi), and by 9 dpi, 60% were affected. At 14 dpi, all 5 sentinel poults had moderate diarrhea. \",\r\n        \"Two infected chicks necropsied at 3 dpi had distended gastrointestinal tracts containing a mixture of yellow liquid and gas. Similar but less extensive findings were seen in infected chicks at 7 dpi. No gross pathology was detected in infected chicks or sentinel chicks at 14 dpi. In necropsies of infected poults, we observed distended gastrointestinal tracts containing a mixture of yellow liquid and gas at all time points.\",\r\n        \"Birds were weighed before inoculation and then at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. PDCoV infection greatly affected the chicks’ weight at 2 dpi (Figure 1, panel A). At 4 and 7 dpi, weight gain averages in infected chicks were comparable to those in uninfected birds, but at 9 and 11 dpi, infected chicks had gained much less weight than the uninfected chicks. By 14 dpi, infected chicks rebounded and showed compensatory weight gain at higher levels than uninfected chicks.\",\r\n        \"Poult weight gain responses differed from those of the chicks. At 2 dpi, infected poults were gaining weight at a much higher rate than uninfected poults (Figure 1, panel B). However, by 4 dpi, poult weight gain was severely curtailed; several lost weight, and the average weight gain for the infected group was 0.5 g, compared with almost 10 g for uninfected poults. By 7 dpi, the infected poults recovered and gained weight at a slightly higher, but not statistically significantly different, rate than the uninfected poults. This trend continued until the end of the study.\",\r\n        \"We examined tissue sections by using light microscopy. We noted suspect zymogen depletion in several poults in both the infected and uninfected groups, suggesting possible inanition. We conducted VH:CD measurements of the ileum and jejunum of intestinal tissues from chicks at 14 dpi (Table 2). Infected chicks had a VH:CD ratio of 4.26:1 compared with a ratio of 6.15:1 for uninfected chicks. The VH:CD ratio was lower in sentinel chicks than in uninfected chicks but the difference was not statistically significant. \",\r\n        \"We could not obtain enough measurements for poult tissues to provide accurate comparisons. IF tissue staining in infected poults demonstrated PDCoV antigen detectable in the epithelial cells lining the villi of the jejunum, although at reduced levels from the ileum and from infected porcine tissue (Figure 2, panel A). We also detected PDCoV antigen in numerous epithelial cells that had sloughed off and remained in the lumen of infected poults when compared with stained tissue sections from uninfected poults (Figure 2, panel B and C). We were unable to visualize a signal in tissues from chicks.\",\r\n        \"We analyzed serum samples collected at 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 dpi. We used indirect ELISA to test samples at 2 and 14 dpi for PDCoV-specific IgY antibodies in all birds from each group, including sentinel birds. We assigned experimental values by averaging 3 replicates. Because we did not have positive controls in chicks and poults, we established a cutoff by using the average final optical density value of uninfected birds at 2 dpi plus 2 SD. We established a separate cutoff value for sentinel birds.\",\r\n        \"At 14 dpi, infected chicks had increased IgY antibody levels in serum, demonstrating an antibody response to PDCoV (Figure 3, panel A), but sentinel chicks did not have antibody levels demonstrating exposure to PDCoV (Figure 3, panel B). Serum samples from poults exhibited a similar range of IgY values. The average IgY values were much higher in infected birds at 14 dpi compared with infected birds at 2 dpi and uninfected birds (Figure 3, panel C). The IgY greatly increased in sentinel poults at 14 dpi compared with IgY values at 2 dpi, but were still below the cutoff value (Figure 3, panel D).\",\r\n        \"All experimentally infected chicks rapidly shed detectable viral RNA postinoculation, and viral RNA titers remained relatively constant through 11 dpi (Figure 4, panels A, B). Viral RNA from cloacal swabs reached 6.52 log10 GE/mL by 2 dpi and remained >6.5 log10 GE/mL until 11 dpi, when levels at 7.14 log10 GE/mL at 9 dpi, then decreased to 5.82 log10 GE/mL at 14 dpi. Despite an absence of noticeable respiratory signs, tracheal swab specimens also showed high levels of PDCoV RNA throughout the study (Figure 4, panel B). PDCoV spread rapidly from infected to naive birds, and all 5 sentinel chicks became positive for PDCoV RNA in both tracheal and cloacal swabs within 2 days of comingling with infected birds (Figure 4, panels C, D).\",\r\n        \"We calculated titers and viral RNA loads in SIC and LIC from infected and sentinel chicks at 3, 7, and 14 dpi (Figure 5). We used RNA isolated at 14 dpi from SIC of 1 infected and 1 sentinel bird to amplify an ≈1,300-bp portion of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PDCoV, then gel extracted and sequenced the resulting product. The samples sequenced had >99% identity with the original inoculum, Ohio FD22 strain of PDCoV. We tested infectivity of intestinal contents of infected and sentinel chicks by using TCID50 assay at 7 and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel A).\",\r\n        \"Similar to the results from chicks, results for infected poults showed all had high levels of PDCoV RNA in cloacal and tracheal swabs through 14 dpi (Figure 6, panels A, B). Poults appeared to have higher initial viral loads, averaging 8.07 log10 GE/mL by 2 dpi, decreasing to ≈6 log10 GE/mL at 4 dpi, and persisting through 14 dpi (Figure 6, panel A). Naive birds also were susceptible to infection, and cloacal and tracheal swab specimens from all sentinel poults were positive for PDCoV RNA within 2 days after comingling with infected poults (Figure 6, panels C, D, E). We calculated titers and viral RNA loads in SIC and LIC from infected and sentinel poults at 3, 7, and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel B). We tested infectivity of intestinal contents of infected and sentinel poults by using TCID50 assay at 7 and 14 dpi (Figure 5, panel B).\",\r\n        \"We isolated viral RNA from the SIC of 1 infected and 1 sentinel bird at 14 dpi and used it to amplify an ≈1,300-bp portion of the N gene of PDCoV, then gel extracted and sequenced the resulting product. As we noted in chicks, the samples sequenced had >99% identity with the original inoculum, the Ohio FD22 strain of PDCoV.\",\r\n        \"Emerging viruses in at least 2 genera of porcine CoVs have exhibited increased propensity for interspecies transmission (2,29). Porcine APN was identified as a major cell entry receptor for PDCoV (19,30). APN is a protein that exhibits enzymatic activity, peptide processing, cholesterol uptake, and chemotaxis to cell signaling and cell adhesion (31). APN is widely distributed and highly conserved in amino acid sequences across species of the Animalia kingdom (19) and is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including epithelial cells of the kidneys (31), respiratory tract (32,33), and gastrointestinal tract (34).\",\r\n        \"Our data suggest that chicks and poults are susceptible to infection with PDCoV. In addition, the rapid transmission of PDCoV to the sentinel birds that comingled with infected birds demonstrates that the virus could spread easily. The length of our pilot study did not allow us to determine how long the chicks and poults would be affected by PDCoV or how long they might shed viral RNA. The chicks appeared to recover more rapidly than poults; clinical signs diminished or were completely absent by 14 dpi. However, chicks still were shedding low viral RNA titers at 14 dpi. Poults did not recover by the end of the study and still exhibited gross pathology and mild to moderate diarrhea. PDCoV RNA shedding titers were higher in poults than in the chicks. Cloacal shedding titers in chicks peaked at 9 dpi and then decreased. In poults, cloacal viral RNA shedding titers were multiphasic, peaking at 2 dpi, with additional smaller peaks at 9 and 14 dpi. The rapid onset of viral RNA shedding correlates with previous in vitro data in which the PDCoV S1 domain bound most efficiently to APN of galline origin (19) and cytopathic effects were observed more rapidly in leghorn male hepatoma and DF1 chicken cell lines compared with swine testicular cells (S.P. Kenney, unpub. data).\",\r\n        \"ELISA results showed that both chicks and poults developed PDCoV antibodies by 14 dpi. Pig infection dynamics have demonstrated a similar serum neutralizing antibody titer increase at 7–14 days (12,23). Sentinel birds had low or undetectable antibody responses compared with experimentally challenged birds, likely because of the passive infection method and because less time passed between exposure to the virus and the end of the study.\",\r\n        \"Recent studies demonstrated that PDCoV can infect and kill cells of other species through APN receptors (19,35). PDCoV has been reported to infect commercial chickens in vivo (36). The differences in susceptibility to PDCoV infection between chicks and poults we observed could be related to differences in APN expression levels between the species. \",\r\n        \"The true incidence rates for PDCoV infection, natural host range, reservoirs, and routes of transmission are still relatively unknown, and no plans for vaccine development have been reported (37). DCoV RNA has been detected in fecal samples from wild birds (38,39), Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata), and leopard cats (40). In addition to swine, calves have been shown by experimental testing to be susceptible to PDCoV infection (41). These data, coupled with the PDCoV binding receptor APN being conserved across many species, suggest that the host range for PDCoV is broader than initially expected (19). The close sequence homology between DCoV isolates from mammalian and wild bird species implies a transmission cycle in which PDCoV regularly crosses from wild birds and mammals into animal production systems, including the swine and poultry industries.

Nucleotide alignments identified five distinct RSA strains. Comparison of the RSA strains to all available WU partial VP2 sequences on Genbank clustered existing strains into four genotypes that were named genotypes 1–4 for this study on the basis of bootstrap and p-distance analysis. Representative sequences of each unique strain in Genbank were included in the tree in Fig. 1\\n. Genotypes differed on average between 1.3% and 3.6% to each other and less than 1.3% within groups (results not shown). Most RSA WU strains clustered with genotype 1, which could be subdivided into five subgenotypes (1a–1e). Nineteen variable sites were identified across the 250 bp VP2 gene region (Fig. 2\\n). Most nucleotide differences between the main genotypes translated into amino acid changes (2.1–7% average amino acid difference between genotypes) (Fig. 2B). RSA isolates in subgenotypes 1b, 1c and genotype 2 were unique and differed from all other strains. Strain B2 had a deletion of 12 nucleotides (translating into five amino acids) that was not present in the RSA genotype 2 strain (SAW526524) and was not visible in the alignment. RSA genotype 1d strains differed by one amino acid from genotype 1b, 1c, and 1e strains, which were identical at amino acid level. RSA strains in subgenotype 1e and 1d were identical to strains identified in Australia, the USA and Korea (Fig. 2).

The frequencies of WUV (7%) was higher than those detected in Scotland12; Australia, the USA and Canada,1, 4 but similar to levels in Thailand13 and Germany.10 The only study including immunocompromised patients, which was performed in Scotland, had very limited numbers of patients with advanced HIV disease. HIV infection was more prevalent in WUV-positive patients (57%) as compared with the overall respiratory virus patient group screened in the present study (33%), although not yet statistically significant due to the small sample size. Too few KIV-positive patients were identified to draw any conclusion about HIV prevalence. The low number of detected KIV-positive cases (1%) does not suggest a significant role in either HIV-positive or HIV-negative patients. Although immunocompromised patients were identified among WUV-positive patients from Australia, and the USA, very few HIV-infected patients were included. The immune status of children in Thailand or Germany was not clear.10, 13 Fifty healthy volunteers were all negative for WUV and KIV suggesting an absence of these viruses in healthy immunocompetent children. Despite the small number of specimens in this control group, they represent truly healthy children rather than hospitalised patients that may be more susceptible to infections. WUV-positive control patients in previous studies were all immunosuppressed or hospitalised for other reasons.4, 12 Larger control groups of children without respiratory disease that are immunocompetent and immunosuppressed may shed further light on WUV disease association.\",\r\n        \"Most HIV-positive RSA patients with WUV had moderate to severe disease with symptoms ranging from pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, and PCP-like pneumonia. This may be due to the immunosuppression as seen in HIV disease, but may also be linked to the increased incidence of co-infections, compounding clinical severity. Patients with mild disease were mostly HIV-negative, but again due to limited patient numbers, this finding was not statistically significant. Co-infections were identified in 71% of WUV-infected patients in our study group, relative to Germany (54.8%), Thailand (43%), Australia (79.7%), and the USA (71%). Two patients had co-infections with both WUV and KIV, one that was HIV-negative with a bocavirus co-infection had mild disease, while the other had stage 4 AIDS with moderate disease, and a co-infection with rhinovirus and symptoms similar to PCP-like pneumonia. Further investigations are needed to determine if these polyomaviruses contribute to respiratory syndromes in young patients with AIDS.\",\r\n        \"Comparison of our data to populations without significant HIV burden does not indicate a greater infection rate in immunocompetent relative to immunosuppressed children. However, 71% of cases were associated with ALRI in RSA vs 56% in Germany which may possibly be due to the higher HIV sero-prevalence. The range of co-infections was also similar, but may increase the severity of disease in immunosuppressed patients although this should be confirmed in larger studies.\",\r\n        \"Identification of WUV in a one-day old child complements similar findings in the USA.7\\n\",\r\n        \"Phylogenetic analysis of strains from 5 continents has identified at least 4 major WUV genotypes.

The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Certainly, the rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months.14, 15\\n\",\r\n        \"Although a generally well‐tolerated and safe procedure, the risks and benefits of tracheostomy in terms of outcomes, pulmonary care and risks to the health care team remain unknown.16, 17 Fortunately, although not perfect, rapid testing protocols have allowed us to be able to detect active infection in patients who are affected by SARS‐CoV‐2.18, 19, 20, 21 What is clear is that the upper aerodigestive tract, the nasopharynx and the trachea harbor a high viral load during the acute stages of the infection.22, 23, 24 Therefore, performing a tracheostomy in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers. The risk of this procedure has to be balanced with the known risks of prolonged intubation, primarily tracheal and subglottic stenosis, the management of which can be problematic if significant mucosal injury and subsequent stenosis occur.\",\r\n        \"The New York Head and Neck Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1979, which encourages the exchange and advancement of scientific knowledge relative to the management of head and neck cancer and includes several member institutions, including Columbia University Medical Center, Cornell Medical College, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York University Medical Center and Montefiore Medical Center Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and has several other affiliate institutions in the greater New York City area. The New York Head and Neck Society has collaborated on this document to provide guidance on the performance of tracheostomy during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.\",\r\n        \"In patients who are intubated, especially in prolonged intubations >72 hours, the risk of tracheal stenosis increases over time. Teams managing these patients should stress that all intubated patients have a Q4‐hour cuff pressure check with a goal of approximately 30 cm H2O if feasible, given the vent parameter requirements, as pressures higher than 30 cm H2O may result in pressure necrosis. Certainly, adequate pressure to avoid cuff leakage and aerosolization is critical when managing SARS‐CoV‐2 patients, but it should be recognized that unnecessarily high cuff pressures are also problematic. The minimum cuff pressure required to create an adequate seal should be individualized for each patient and verified frequently by care providers. Certainly, high peak pressures, or issues with ventilation may make the appropriate cuff pressure a moving target. This is a dynamic process, and frequent adjustments may be indicated depending on ventilation parameters. Prevention of tracheal mucosal pressure necrosis, resulting tracheal and cricoid chondritis and subsequent stenosis is critical in the SARS‐CoV‐2 population.25, 26\\n\",\r\n        \"SARS‐CoV‐2 testing via the reverse transcription‐ polymerase chain reaction (rt‐PCR) detection platform for SARS‐CoV‐2 and pan‐sarbecovirus detection is recommended for all patients who are being considered for tracheostomy. It should be remembered that data surrounding accuracy of the test during the pandemic is forthcoming, and false negatives are a real possibility.\\n27\\n In addition, rt‐PCR may not be reliable when determining infectivity/active virus vs the mere presence of viral DNA and therefore while levels detected by rt‐PCR do tend to correlate with the active viral load, robust data are lacking to support the utilization of a testing protocol for viral load and decision making in SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients. The test may be performed a second time if clinical suspicion or institutional policy warrants repeat testing for the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 prior to high‐risk procedures.\",\r\n        \"When determining the appropriate time of tracheostomy in the SARS‐CoV‐2 patient, several factors are considered, and individual cases may certainly have mitigating circumstances that lead to the decision to perform tracheostomy. However, for the majority of patients, health care teams should seek to capitalize on the intersection of the risk of contamination/infection and decreasing viral load in the upper and lower airways over time with the risks of prolonged intubation (ie, tracheal stenosis, weaning issues, pulmonary toilet, etc.). Although the overall risk of tracheal stenosis secondary to prolonged intubation depends on a variety of factors, reported rates of severe, symptomatic stenosis are generally in the 1% to 2% range when modern low‐pressure cuffs are utilized.28, 29, 30, 31, 32 Therefore, in light of the relatively low risk of clinically relevant stenosis, and despite the traditional 10‐day cutoff for increased stenosis risk used by many practitioners in the general population, when dealing with a SARS‐CoV‐2 patient, the risk for symptomatic or severe tracheal stenosis is acceptable in light of the significant risks of tracheostomy in the acute phase of the infection during periods of the highest viral loads. The decreasing viral load, although logarithmic in nature, is somewhat variable, and high viral loads have been observed somewhat late in the course of the infection in critically ill patients (Figures 1 and 2).23, 24, 33 Therefore, when feasible, waiting until approximately 21 days after the onset of symptoms is recommended prior to consideration of tracheostomy for the majority of cases in order to avoid exposing health care teams to increased risk. Earlier tracheostomy may certainly be medically indicated in some situations depending on the clinical situation, or health care system issues during a pandemic situation, and we recognize the potential need to perform tracheostomy more urgently. Tracheostomy should not be delayed regardless of SARS‐CoV‐2 status in life‐saving situations or in situations in which the tracheostomy would significantly improve the prognosis of the patient. Certainly the timing of tracheostomy remains a controversial issue and data is limited related to SARS‐CoV‐2.\\n53\\n Alternative emerging strategies in the management of SARS‐CoV‐2 critically ill patients, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, antiviral therapy and convalescent plasma therapy, may also be considered by the team, but the available data and decision making regarding this is beyond the scope of these recommendations.34, 35, 36, 37, 38 Clearly, these are multidisciplinary decisions that will be individualized depending on the patient and institutional expertise.\",\r\n        \"In addition, it should be noted that avoiding tracheostomy in patients at high risk of mortality is critical. If the primary team managing the patient determines that there is an extremely high risk of mortality in the near future or that the patient has a high likelihood of withdrawal of care, the risks of tracheostomy should be avoided in this situation. Patients with significant medical comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome/severe respiratory failure and a low chance of recovery who are infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 should be carefully evaluated, and discussions with family members, consultants, institutional ethics committees and the treating team should focus on overall prognosis and goals of care prior to performing tracheostomy as a routine matter of care. These decisions are highly individualized and rely on solid communication among team members managing these high‐risk patients.\",\r\n        \"Although the exact technical details regarding tracheostomy will depend on the situation and procedural protocols and technical expertise, there are some specific technical aspects related to the SARS‐CoV‐2 (and other viral pandemics) that should be considered. Ideally, the procedure should be performed at bedside in the intensive care unit in a negative pressure room or using a portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration system to avoid patient transportation and contamination of other areas in the medical center. If it is necessary to perform the procedure in the operating room (OR), a specific OR cluster should be designated to avoid contamination of additional OR resources for noninfected patients. In addition to standard airborne and droplet precautions, techniques to minimize aerosolization of the virus during the procedure include the following: paralysis to prevent coughing; consider glycopyrrolate to reduce secretions; preoxygenation and cessation of ventilation during the tracheostomy procedure; utilization of closed suctioning systems; avoiding monopolar electrocautery, or harmonic technology, and using cold instrumentation when feasible; minimizing suctioning and bronchoscopy during the procedure; and ensuring the cuff is inflated prior to resuming ventilation, so the circuit is closed.\",\r\n        \"In addition to standard open tracheostomy with an apneic technique, percutaneous/dilational tracheostomy techniques have been evaluated extensively in the literature and have been shown to be a safe alternative to traditional open surgical tracheostomy.39, 40, 41 Understandably, the techniques utilized when performing tracheostomy will vary based on patient characteristics, provider expertise and institutional experience. Although data are limited, techniques that avoid opening the airway and are closed, such as a percutaneous dilational technique, may be preferential in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.42, 43 Therefore, if there are no anatomical or other contraindications, percutaneous dilational tracheostomy may be considered if the expertise is available. It should be remembered that the decrease in aerosolization during percutaneous tracheostomy only holds true if airway manipulation (ie, bronchoscopy with cuff deflation or concurrent ventilation) is not performed, and although there have been some associated higher complication rates with blind percutaneous tracheostomy compared to bronchoscopic technique, ultrasound‐guided techniques have been shown to be noninferior to bronchoscopic techniques.44, 45, 46 Therefore, when considering a percutaneous tracheostomy, a closed ultrasound‐guided or “cuff‐up” apneic technique is recommended for SARS‐CoV‐2 patients.\",\r\n        \"Although there are limited data on the current pandemic to fully inform personal protective equipment (PPE) recommendations, performing tracheostomy in an actively infected SARS‐CoV‐2 patient is certainly a high‐risk procedure for health care workers.\\n47\\n Health care personnel performing the tracheostomy should wear at minimum: waterproof cap, goggles with an antimist screen, impermeable operating room surgeon's gown and gloves and a transparent plastic facial shield worn outside the goggles and N95 that is effective in filtering 99.5% particles larger than 0.75 μm and 95% effective in the .1 to .3 μm range.\\n48\\n The minimum number of health care workers required to perform the procedure should be present to prevent unnecessary exposures.\",\r\n        \"The effectiveness of the N95 mask in the prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection during tracheostomy procedures remains unknown, but given the high risk and the reported size of thevirus ranging from 70‐90 nm, consideration for power air‐purifying respirator (PAPR) systems for personnel performing tracheostomy should be entertained.\\n54\\n These systems should be used when available in situations of acute active infection, or suspicion of high viral loads, as there is some evidence of superior protection (PAPR provides 2.5‐100 times greater protection than the N95 when staff are appropriately trained).47, 49, 50 The effectiveness of N95 and PAPR in this situation has certainly not been compared in a head‐to‐head trial, and therefore, the use of PAPR vs N95 will depend on institutional resources and policy and the clinical situation until further data is available.\",\r\n        \"Techniques to manage the acute airway with endotracheal intubation, video laryngoscope for example, should be utilized if possible to avoid emergent tracheostomy in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients due to the high risk of unsafe conditions and health care worker contaminations.\\n48\\n Similarly, intubation techniques (ie, rapid sequence intubation) that avoid mask ventilation, such as prolonged open airway manipulation, are recommended when appropriate. When life‐threatening airway obstruction occurs in a setting in which intubation is not possible, health care workers should perform the tracheostomy with the above‐noted PPE, keeping in mind that PAPR respirator use is often not feasible or available in emergent situations. In situations in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation is being performed, chest compressions should be avoided at the time the airway is entered until the airway is secured and the cuff is inflated on the device to minimize health care worker exposure.\",\r\n        \"Posttracheostomy management should also be mentioned as, in addition to routine tracheostomy care, there are some considerations for SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. Securing circuits properly and avoiding unnecessary humidification systems may reduce the risk of unexpected circuit disconnection and aerosolization leading to exposure. The circuit should remain closed as much as possible, and closed‐line suctioning should be used. Heat moister exchangers with viral filters and HEPA filtration should be used when possible. Tracheostomy tube changes should be avoided and should only be performed in cases of cuff failure or emergent situations.\",\r\n        \"Although the members of the health care team performing tracheostomy vary across institutions, team members may include surgeons, medicine/intensivists, anesthesiologists, respiratory therapists, nurses and other ancillary staff required during these procedures. The importance of appropriate PPE/PAPR training and usage cannot be overstated in the setting of active SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Teams that perform the procedure regularly will be more efficient and less likely to be unfamiliar with the procedure or appropriate health care protective measures and infection control. The inclusion of trainees such as residents and fellows during these procedures requires careful consideration and will vary based on institutional policies.\",\r\n        \"Currently, there are limited data on the host innate immune status of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients.\\n51\\n Consideration of the inclusion of health care workers who have previously been exposed and subsequently recovered from documented SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may be warranted. Although the exact timing of immunity and subsequent safety for the return of health care providers infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 remains unknown, sufficient antibody responses have been documented to occur between 15 and 20 days, or approximately 2 weeks, after the onset of symptoms (Figure 3).\\n23\\n Inclusion of these individuals on these teams may allow for high‐risk procedures to be performed by health care workers who have mounted an immune response to the virus depending on institutional quarantine policies. Similarly, these individuals should not be involved in tracheostomy procedures or other airway procedures in noninfected patients due to the risk of iatrogenic infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 due to limited available data about the risks.\\n52\\n\\n\",\r\n        \"Tracheostomy in the SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patient represents a unique situation, with a unique set of risks and implications. When compared to traditional tracheostomy procedures in the setting of prolonged ventilation, SARS‐CoV‐2 represents a unique entity in terms of timing, indications and infection control considerations that must be remembered when performing these procedures and managing patient's posttracheostomy. Additional resources are listed below.\",\r\n        \"\\nCareful consideration of “who” and “when” when tracheostomy is planned is recommended.Careful consideration of the location and technique to avoid unnecessary risks to health care providers is recommended.When clinically appropriate, delay of tracheostomy procedures is recommended to allow for reduced viral load and to decrease the risk of nosocomial infection to critical health care providers.Selecting appropriately sized endotracheal tube (ETT), and careful monitoring of ETT cuff pressures to maintain appropriate seal to avoid aerosolization when mitigating the risk of long‐term tracheal complications is recommended.Appropriate PPE training and utilization, including N95 or PAPR when indicated, is recommended for all patients undergoing tracheostomy, regardless of SARS‐CoV‐2 status, during the pandemic.Avoidance of unnecessary airway manipulation, such as ventilation during bronchoscopy; routine trach changes, with a focus on a closed‐circuit ventilation; and utilizing apneic open tracheotomy/bronchoscopy or ultrasound guidance for percutaneous tracheostomy, is recommended.\\n\",\r\n        \"American Academy of Otolaryngology‐Head and Neck Surgery.\",\r\n        \"Tracheostomy Recommendations during COVID‐19 Pandemic.\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://www.entnet.org/content/tracheotomy-recommendations-during-covid-19-pandemic\\n\",\r\n        \"American Head and Neck Society Guidance for Tracheostomy during COVID‐19 Pandemic.\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://www.ahns.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Guidance-for-Surgical-Tracheostomy-and-Tracheostomy-Tube-Change-during-the-COVID.pdf\\n\",\r\n        \"Percutaneous Tracheostomy Technique:\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/tracheostomy/about/how.html\\n\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://www.vumc.org/trauma-and-scc/sites/vumc.org.trauma-and-scc/files/public_files/Protocols/Tracheostomy%202019.pdf\\n\",\r\n        \"Open Tracheostomy Technique:\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/tracheostomy/about/pac-20384673\\n\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17568-tracheostomy-care\\n\",\r\n        \"\\nhttps://medicine.uiowa.edu/iowaprotocols/tracheotomy-tracheostomy\\n\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304119/;

The sentinel sites were private (7 sites) and public (7 sites) primary healthcare centers. At each sentinel site, trained nurses or physicians identified all ILI cases presenting at the clinics from Monday through Sunday. The surveillance staff consisted of facility staff who worked on the surveillance program on a voluntary basis. An ILI case was defined as an outpatient presenting with sudden onset of fever (temperature >38°C) and cough or sore throat, with the onset of symptoms within the prior 5 days. All individuals with ILI were considered eligible for enrollment. Subjects were enrolled on a daily basis. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all identified cases who were ≥18 years of age.

HMPV and RSV were detected by multiplex RT-PCR method 1; PIV 1–4 by multiplex RT-PCR method 2; HRV, enterovirus, and influenza C virus by multiplex RT-PCR method 3; and HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1 by multiplex RT-PCR method 4. The products of multiplex RT-PCR methods 1–3 were subjected to heminested multiplex RT-PCR, as described previously [9]. However, multiplex method 1 was modified by using only primers for HMPV and RSV. Multiplex method 4 was developed for the simultaneous detection of the 4 HCoVs, using primers described by Vabret et al [10]. Multiplex RT-PCR and heminested PCR products were visualized under UV light after electrophoresis, using an ethidium bromide–stained 2% agarose gel.\",\r\n        \"We amplified each sample in the 4 different multiplex RT-PCR assays, each containing primers for 2 or 4 different viral targets.

HRV, PIV, and HCoV were detected throughout the study period, with no evident temporal patterns.\\n\",\r\n        \"This report contains the first description of the etiology of respiratory viruses associated with patients with ILI in Cameroon. We detected respiratory viruses in 65.1% of our samples; influenza virus and HRV were the most common viruses detected. The high frequency of virus detection among patients with ILI in our study is consistent with that of studies conducted in other countries, including Madagascar (75.1%) [7], Senegal (58.5%) [6], Kenya (56%) [5], Shanghai (59.5%) [11], and Brazil (61.8%) [12]. In other studies in the developed and developing worlds, however, respiratory viruses were detected in <50% of cases [2, 4, 11, 13–16]. These differences could be due to true differences in overall burden, to differences in study populations, or to the use of different diagnostic techniques. Druce et al in Australia [14] included hospitalized patients in their study for 5 months over a 12-month period, and Puzelli et al in Italy [4] included hospitalized patients during the winter. Lina et al in France [2] used immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and immunostaining for the detection of respiratory viruses in their samples, and Laguna-Torres et al in Peru [13] used viral isolation. These techniques are known to be less sensitive than molecular techniques.\",\r\n        \"Like in many other studies [4, 6, 7, 13–15], influenza A virus was the most common viral pathogen detected in patients with ILI. In addition, PIV, RSV, HCoV, HMPV, and enterovirus were identified from patient's specimens and contributed collectively to 29.4% of all ILI cases in our study. The rate of detection of RSV in our study (5.7%) was lower than rates reported by other investigators. For example, in a study performed in Madagascar [7, 17], 21.2% of samples from patients with ILI were positive for RSV. The low proportion of RSV-positive samples in our study could be because we did not include hospitalized children, as RSV has been shown to be a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital [2, 14]. The detection rate for HCoV (5.3%), PIVs (7.5%), and HMPV (5.0%) was in agreement with data from other studies [16, 18–21].\",\r\n        \"The detection rate of influenza A virus was significantly higher among patients with ILI who were ≥5 years of age [13], while other viruses, such as HRV, PIV, and RSV, were prevalent among children aged <5 years. These findings are consistent with reports from other studies [2, 14, 18, 22–24]. A(H3N2) was predominant in 2009 in Cameroon, a finding that was similar in other Central and West Africa countries [25, 26] despite the introduction of A(H1N1)pdm09 in several countries worldwide in that year.\",\r\n        \"Recent data from tropical countries, including Senegal and Cambodia, demonstrate that the seasonality of influenza virus transmission corresponds mostly with the rainy season, and only a few cases can be detected during the dry season [27, 28]. This is consistent with our finding of a higher circulation of influenza virus during June–July and October–November 2009, corresponding to the rainy season in most of the areas where our sentinel sites are located. However, the seasonality of influenza virus in Cameroon in 2009 contrasts our earlier study that showed that A(H1N1) was the prevalent influenza A virus subtype circulating in the country in 2008 and that it had no marked seasonality [8]. This highlights the need for multiple years of influenza surveillance to properly define the temporal patterns of influenza virus circulation, especially in tropical areas, where less demarcated seasonal patterns are observed.\",\r\n        \"HRV was the second most frequent viral agent detected, with positive results for 17% of patients with ILI, including all age groups. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that HRV is responsible for a large proportion of acute respiratory tract infections in both adults and children, composing 10% to >40% of respiratory infections [12, 16, 29, 30]. HRV circulated year-round, a finding shown in other studies [7, 12, 15]. Increased HRV circulation coincided with a period of decreased activity for influenza virus, a situation also observed in Madagascar [7]. In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected in children <5 years of age (25.6%). This finding contrasts with other studies conducted in Senegal [6] and China [11], where the predominant virus detected in children <5 years of age was RSV. This difference could be due to different inclusion criteria for the study subjects. We included mostly children with upper respiratory tract infection; the studies conducted in Senegal and China also included children with lower respiratory tract infection. HRV has been reported to be the major cause of upper respiratory tract infections in children in Italy [29].\",\r\n        \"Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, we did not test for some respiratory DNA viruses (adenovirus and bocavirus), and we did not test for any respiratory bacteria. Adenovirus has been shown to be responsible for up to 13% of acute respiratory tract infections [18, 20]. As such, our results may underestimate the overall frequency of respiratory viral infections among ILI patients in Cameroon. Second, although our findings suggest considerable circulation of respiratory viruses in the country, we are limited in our ability to fully assess the burden of these viral agents: because our focus was on patients with ILI who presented at selected outpatient clinics, we lack data on the contribution of the investigated viruses to cases of pneumonia resulting in hospitalization. Third, the involvement of facility staff on a voluntary basis, with frequent shifts in personnel to other facilities, resulted in the poor performance of sentinel sites in some regions. This, coupled with the narrow interval of our study (1 year), hindered our ability to implement region-specific analysis to assess spatiotemporal variations in virus circulation in relation to climatic and geographic factors.\",\r\n        \"Despite these limitations, this study is the first to describe the etiology of RNA viral pathogens involved in upper respiratory tract infections in Cameroon. These viruses may also induce more severe disease, especially in young children, which should be investigated. We have also shown that the use of multiplex RT-PCR permits a rapid differential diagnosis of ILI cases, which could potentially facilitate rapid detection of epidemics of respiratory virus infection and, therefore, rapid responses to outbreaks.\",\r\n        \"This study should be expanded over several years and in different settings (eg, hospitals) to ascertain the seasonal variation of ARI and individual viruses and to provide a better understanding of the epidemiology and spectrum of illness caused by respiratory viruses in Cameroon.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23169968/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jis573\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC3259199\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1016/j.virol.2011.12.002\",\r\n    title:\r\n      \"Characterization and inhibition of norovirus proteases of genogroups I and II using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2012-02-01\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Kyeong-Ok.Chang\",\r\n      \"Daisuke.Takahashi\",\r\n      \"Om.Prakash\",\r\n      \"Yunjeong.Kim\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"MD145pro efficiently cleaved substrates originated from the cleavage site of GI norovirus ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Z factor analysis ::: Results\",\r\n          \"DMSO tolerance ::: Results\",\r\n          \"NVpro and MD145pro showed a similar inhibitor profile ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Chemical shift mapping to study the interaction of NVpro and chymostatin ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Docking model of NVpro with chymostatin ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"The expression and purification of proteases from NV and MD145 viruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"The expression and purification of proteases from NV and MD145 viruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Substrates ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"FRET protease assays ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Correction factor for the inner filter effects ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Determination of kcat/km ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Determination of Z factor ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Determination of Z factor ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"DMSO tolerance ::: FRET assay with proteases from Norwalk and MD145 noroviruses ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Pilot screening of protease inhibitors ::: FRET protease assay with protease inhibitors ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Determination of IC50 and Ki of chymostatin ::: FRET protease assay with protease inhibitors ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Solution NMR spectroscopy of NVpro ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Docking calculations ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Statistics ::: Materials and methods\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"Noroviruses are responsible for more than 60% of all food- or water-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks in humans with an estimated 23 million annual cases in the U.S. alone, followed by Salmonella infection (C.D.C., 2010, Fankhauser et al., 1998). The symptoms of noroviral gastroenteritis such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, fever, chills, myalgias and sore throat usually last for 24 to 48 h (Green et al., 2001). Although noroviruses generally cause mild to moderate gastroenteritis, it can incapacitate affected individuals in military troops on ships or in war zones (Green et al., 2001), and can be severe to life-threatening in the young, elderly and immunocompromised patients (Atmar and Estes, 2006, Dolin, 2007). Recent studies have shown that noroviral diarrhea can persist for up to 4 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002, Sakai et al., 2001) and the viruses can be excreted for up to 3 weeks (Rockx et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been reported that norovirus diarrhea and shedding lasted longer than 2 years in an immunocompromised patient (Nilsson et al., 2003).\",\r\n        \"The Norwalk virus (NV) is the first enteric calicivirus discovered in 1972 (Kapikian et al., 1972). Since the discovery of the first norovirus, at least five genogroups have been established in the genus Norovirus. Among them GI, GII, and rarely GIV viruses infect humans. The GI and GII noroviruses are further subdivided into genotypes GI/1–7 and GII/1–15 (Green, 2007). NV is the most studied prototype virus and is classified as GI/1 strain. In recent years, GII/4 noroviruses became predominantly associated with norovirus outbreaks and sporadic cases worldwide (Siebenga et al., 2010, Zheng et al., 2010). Overall, norovirus strains belonging to the GII are found in 75–100% of sporadic cases of norovirus infections (Patel et al., 2009), and GII/4 strains account for 60–70% of all reported norovirus outbreaks globally (Kroneman et al., 2008, Siebenga et al., 2009).\",\r\n        \"However, no vaccine or antiviral drug is currently available for norovirus infections, which is largely due to the absence of cell culture systems and animal models for human noroviruses. Noroviruses show high diversity, and immunity to one strain does not necessarily provide protection from infection with another strain. In addition, inadequate long-term immunity against noroviruses is indicated by repeated infections in adults (Glass et al., 2009, Green, 2007). Although noroviruses do not multiply in food or water, they can cause large outbreaks because as few as 10–100 virions are sufficient to cause illness in a healthy adult (Green, 2007). Noroviruses are classified as NIAID category B priority pathogens (NIAID) due to their highly contagious nature and a potential to cause a serious public health challenge. Therefore, development of antiviral drugs is highly desirable for preventing and treating norovirus infections.\",\r\n        \"Noroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses and encode three open reading frames (ORFs) for a nonstructural polyprotein and minor and major structural proteins. The gene organization of the norovirus nonstructural polyproteins encoded by ORF1 is N-terminal protein (Nterm, NS1-2), NTPase (NS3), p22 (3A-like protein, NS4), VPg (NS5), protease (Pro, NS6), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol, NS7) (Green et al., 2001) (Fig. 1\\n). Norovirus protease specifically recognizes and cleaves LQ/GP (Nterm/NTPase), LQ/GP (NTPase/p20), PE/GK (p20/VPg), FE/AP (VPg/Pro), and LE/GG (Pro/Pol) junctions to produce the mature proteins during viral replication (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Liu et al., 1999, Sosnovtsev et al., 2006). Norovirus protease is classified as 3C-like cysteine protease due to its similarity to picornavirus 3C protease, which has a catalytic triad of amino acids composed of C, H, and E or D (Green, 2007, Nakamura et al., 2005). Since norovirus protease is essential for viral replication, viral protease represents an attractive target for antiviral drug development. The design and screening of antiviral agents targeting viral protease can be greatly facilitated by the availability of an assay that is suitable for large scale screening of potential novel drugs targeting viral protease.\",\r\n        \"The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) protease assay has been developed to provide a rapid and specific identification of protease inhibitors for various cellular and viral proteases including foot-and-mouth virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Blanchard et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007). In this assay system, substrates have a fluorescence donor and a quencher on each end, and the donor fluorescence signal in the uncleaved substrate is inhibited by the interaction of the fluorescence donor and quencher. Once substrates are cleaved by a protease, the donor fluorescence is no longer quenched, yielding an increase in fluorescence intensity. Addition of protease inhibitors to the assay inhibits the cleavage of the substrates, which leads to reduced fluorescence intensity, enabling screening of potential protease inhibitors. The FRET protease assay system is also a useful tool for measuring the activity and substrate specificity of a protease. So far, most of information on the proteolytic processing of the norovirus proteases has been obtained using in vitro transcription–translation assay systems (Belliot et al., 2003, Hardy et al., 2002, Scheffler et al., 2007, Seah et al., 1999, Someya and Takeda, 2009). Limited studies are reported on the kinetics of GI norovirus proteases using fluorogenic (Someya et al., 2008) or chromogenic substrates (Hussey et al., 2011). However studies on those of GII norovirus protease are not available. Furthermore, a FRET-based protease assay suitable as a high-throughput screening of protease inhibitors has not yet been reported for norovirus proteases of GI or GII noroviruses (Zeitler et al., 2006).\",\r\n        \"In this study, we describe the development and application of a high-throughput FRET assay using norovirus proteases from NV (NVpro) and MD145 virus (MD145pro) that belong to genogroups I (GI/1) and II (GII/4), respectively. Based on the assay, similar kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrates and inhibition by a selection of standard protease inhibitors including chymostatin were observed for NVpro and MD145pro. The binding of chymostatin and NVpro was also studied to validate the interactions using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\",\r\n        \"The NVpro and MD145pro exhibited enzymatic activity with similar cleavage efficiency on each substrate (kcat/km) (Fig. 2\\n, Table 1\\n), suggesting that MD145pro is able to efficiently recognize and cleave the substrates derived from a cleavage site of GI norovirus. Both proteases showed higher cleavage efficiency towards the truncated substrate (DFHLQGP) as indicated by higher kcat/km value, compared to the substrate of 14 residues (EPDFHLQGPEDLAK) (Table 1). The mutant NV protease (C139A) did not increase fluorescence signal on addition of substrates, as expected (data not shown). The edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl was used as a substrate for further experiments.\",\r\n        \"The Z factor is a measure of the distance between the standard deviation for the positive (fluorescence signal) and negative (background) controls of the assay, and is used to evaluate the overall quality of a high-throughput screening assay (Inglese et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 1999). A Z factor of 0.5 or greater is considered robust and reliable indicator for an assay system for screening purpose (Blanchard et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 1999). Fig. 3\\nis the scatter plot of fluorescence units from positive or negative control wells, showing assay range and the data variation. The mean Z factor for our FRET protease assay using NVpro and edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl as a substrate was calculated as 0.86, demonstrating excellent signal-to-background ratio, and robustness and sensitivity of the assay.\",\r\n        \"The effect of DMSO on the FRET-assay with NVpro was determined and shown in Fig. 4\\n. DMSO concentrations of 0.5–2% (final concentration, v/v) did not significantly affect enzymatic activity, indicating that this assay is tolerant of DMSO up to 2%. All the experiments in this study contained less than 1.5% DMSO.\",\r\n        \"Four commercially available serine protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, TPCK, and TLCK) and a papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (antipain) were used to probe the inhibitor specificity of each protease. Chymostatin and TPCK at 50 μM markedly decreased fluorescence intensity from inhibition of substrate cleavage by NVpro and MD145pro (Fig. 5\\n). However, TLCK, antipain and leupeptin failed to show significant inhibition of NVpro or MD145pro under the same condition. Then, chymostatin was used to determine the IC50 and inhibition constants Ki against both proteases. The dose response curves for chymostatin on NVpro and MD145pro are shown in Fig. 6A. Chymostatin inhibited NVpro and MD145pro with a similar efficiency indicated by comparable IC50 and inhibition constant Ki values (Table 2\\n). These results indicate that proteases from two predominant norovirus genogroups share a similar inhibitor profile.\",\r\n        \"Since chymostatin significantly inhibited norovirus proteases in the FRET assay, the binding of chymostatin and NVpro was validated using NMR spectroscopy. A series of 1H–15N HSQC spectra of NVpro with increasing concentrations of chymostatin were analyzed to identify the residues of NVpro involved in the interaction with chymostatin. NMR chemical shift perturbations of backbone amide (1H and 15N) resonance in the 1H–15N HSQC spectra are sensitive probes for changes in chemical environments surrounding amino acid residues and/or in the relative populations of different conformations in protein structural ensemble (Shuker et al., 1996). The weighted chemical shift differences of 1H–15N resonances for NVpro in the presence of varying concentrations of chymostatin were compared to those observed in the absence of chymostatin (Fig. 7A). Significant chemical shift changes were observed during chymostatin titration in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 7A and B), indicating the specific interaction between NVpro and chymostatin. On the other hand, PB compound added as an unrelated control caused no significant chemical shift perturbation for NVpro (Fig. 7C). In the presence of 2-fold molar excess of chymostatin, the residues of NVpro that showed significantly shifts (Δd ≥ 0.04) were T4*, K11*, G17, T27, V31*, I49, A52*, E54, G60, L97, R100, G102, A105*, Q110*,V114*, H115*, Q117*, G119*, A141*, R147*, G133*, G137*, D138*, C139*, G140*, A141*, R147*, V152, H157*, A159, A160*, T161*, K162*, S163*, N165*, and T166*. The residues that could not be traced out due to the peak disappearance and/or line broadening are marked with asterisks and the largest positive values (Δd ≥ 0.15) in Fig. 7A. The line-broadening effects are likely indicative of chemical exchange on the slow time scale (μs–ms) due to the conformational dynamics of NVpro interacting with chymostatin.\",\r\n        \"To corroborate the result obtained for NVpro-chymostatin interaction using NMR spectroscopy, we constructed a docking model for NVpro complexed with chymostatin using HADDOCK program (de Vries et al, Dominguez et al., 2003). During the docking, experimental information on the interface between NVpro and chymostatin derived from NMR chemical shift perturbation was required as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking of two molecules. Based on the NVpro chemical shift perturbation observed in the presence of chymostatin and higher solvent accessibility, T4, K11, S14, A52, K62, R65, D90, E93, L95, R100, Q110, M120, K146, R147, T161, K162, and S163 are designated as active residues in AIRs. In addition, catalytically important residues E54, G137, and C139, which displayed significant perturbation but lower solvent accessibility were also selected as active residues. H30, S91, R112, I135, and P136 adjacent to those active residues were defined as passive residues. The positions of the active and passive residues for NVpro are indicated on the structure (Figs. 8A and B). As a result of the docking calculation, several different clusters with similar HADDOCK score were obtained. For all those clusters, it is indicated that chymostatin is positioned near the active and substrate binding sites of NVpro. The structural ensemble in the lowest energy cluster has RMSD value of 0.8 ± 0.2 Å over all backbone atoms. The representative structure of the lower energy cluster is presented in Fig. 8. The structure has favorable energy values, van der Waals energy of − 27.1 kcal mol− 1 and electrostatic energy of − 145.3 kcal mol− 1, but higher restraint violation energy of 169.9 kcal mol− 1. This higher violation is mostly due to our unbiased selection of active residues showing chemical shift perturbation. As clearly seen in Fig. 8, several residues do not have any direct interactions with chymostatin (T4, K11, K62, R65, S91, E93, L95, R100, M120, K146, and R147). It is highly probable that those residues distant from the binding site were indirectly affected and experienced a certain degree of conformational changes upon binding of chymostatin. The docking model depicted in Fig. 8 demonstrates that chymostatin bound to NVpro in a canonical substrate binding mode as also suggested by NMR data; NVpro-chymostatin interactions occur mainly in C-terminal domain and an arch formed by two β-sheets, βII and cII, covers the chymostatin.\",\r\n        \"Noroviruses are the leading cause of food- or water-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, affecting millions of people in the U.S. alone. Norovirus infection causes debilitating illness in people of all age groups at military bases, as well as in cruise ships, schools, and hospitals. Noroviruses require only a few viral particles to initiate infection and are highly contagious. Moreover, long-lasting immunity following natural infection rarely develops in people. Considering these challenges, antiviral drugs for controlling norovirus infections are in urgent need. Norovirus protease is known to be responsible for critical virus-mediated post-translational cleavages of the polypeptide encoding the viral proteins. Therefore, inhibition of the viral protease has the capacity to prevent viral replication. There are several viral protease inhibitors on the market or under development for pathogenic viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and SARS coronavirus (Ghosh et al., 2007, Kazmierski et al., 2006, Tsantrizos, 2008, Walker et al., 2003). Robust and reliable assays for high throughput screening of potential norovirus protease inhibitors can greatly facilitate the development of antiviral drugs against the viral protease.\",\r\n        \"The genogroup I and II noroviruses are associated with majority of norovirus infections in humans. The amino acid homology of proteases among GI noroviruses is 90–94%, while the homology between GI and GII norovirus proteases is about 65–69%. However, the amino acid sequence analysis showed that the key residues of the catalytic site and residues forming the S1 subsite are conserved in GI and GII noroviruses (Ng and Parra, 2010). A co-transcription and translation assay study using MD145 ORF1 on the enzymatic activity of MD145 (GII) protease suggested that substrate specificity requirements are similar to those for NV (GI) based on western blots and radioactive microsequencing mapping (Belliot et al., 2003). However, there is little information on the comparative kinetic properties of proteases from GI and GII noroviruses. Therefore, we developed a FRET protease assay with high-throughput capability to use for screening of norovirus protease inhibitors, and study the substrate and inhibitor specificities of norovirus proteases of GI and GII noroviruses.\",\r\n        \"The conserved amino acid sequences of P7-P6′ at the N2/3 cleavage site of NV and MD145 noroviruses differ in P3 (H/E), P4 (F/Y) and P6 (P/G) residues, of which P4 position is reported to be important for maximal activity by earlier mapping studies of the cleavage sites recognized by calicivirus proteases (Hardy et al., 2002). In our study, MD145pro cleaved the substrates spanning P7–P7′ or P5–P2′ residues from the NS2/3 cleavage site of NV with an efficiency similar to NVpro, indicating that MD145pro recognized and cleaved the substrates with H and F in P3 and P4 positions, respectively, as efficiently as NVpro. In addition, NVpro and MD145pro cleaved the substrate with P5–P2′ residues more efficiently than substrate with P7–P7′ residues, suggesting that P3′–P7′ and P6–P7 residues are not necessary for substrate binding and cleavage by both proteases. These results are in line with an earlier report that p-nitroaniline peptide with P5–P1 residues was most efficiently cleaved by GI protease (Southampton strain) compared to those containing P6–P1 or P4–P1 residues, and the substrate of P3–P1 residues was not cleaved (Hussey et al., 2011). In addition, Chiba virus protease (GI)-substrate complex modeling based on crystal structure suggested that the substrate binding is stabilized by interactions of substrate residues P5–P2 to the corresponding binding sites of the protease (Nakamura et al., 2005).\",\r\n        \"We then evaluated the inhibitor specificities of NVpro and MD145pro using a set of commercially available standard protease inhibitors. Norovirus protease is structurally similar to the chymotrypsin superfamily based on X-ray crystallography (Nakamura et al., 2005, Zeitler et al., 2006). The standard protease inhibitors share a common mechanism of action, although they do not share the primary sequence for the three-dimensional structures (Bode and Huber, 1992, Laskowski and Kato, 1980). The screening of protease inhibitors in our assay revealed that the activities of both proteases were significantly inhibited by the presence of chymostatin and TPCK. Detailed kinetic studies of the inhibition of NVpro and MD145pro by chymostatin confirmed that both proteases have similar inhibition profiles, suggesting that protease inhibitors may be developed against multiple norovirus genogroups. In addition, the versatility of the assay allows incorporation of proteases from different genogroups so that screening of compounds against various norovirus genogroups can be performed. The quality and suitability of the FRET assay for high throughput screening were demonstrated by high Z factor of 0.86.\",\r\n        \"The interaction of chymostatin and NVpro was validated by the NMR studies. The analysis of NMR chemical shift mapping data revealed that the resonances of residues that are involved in substrate binding sites or active sites are greatly affected. Chymostatin that exhibited strong inhibitory effects against both proteases contains G–L–F moiety. Previous structural studies on the interaction of chymotrypsin and serine standard protease inhibitors showed that side chain of the P1 residue (F) of chymostatin fits into the specificity subsite of chymotrypsin, and the carbonyl oxygen extends toward the oxyanion hole formed by the G and S residues located in the active site of the enzyme. The P1–P3 residues of chymostatin also interact with the enzyme by forming a short, anti-parallel β-sheet interaction (Coombs et al., 1999). These interactions represent a substrate-like binding mode for enzymes. Our docking results using HADDOCK based on NMR chemical shift perturbation study indicate that chymostatin specifically interacts with NVpro in a canonical binding mode that can be seen in the protease-substrate/substrate-directed inhibitor complexes. At this stage we are not able to give a clear answer for whether chymostatin covalently modifies the nucleophilic thiol group and forms hemithioacetal adduct or forms non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. However our results indicate that critical residues for the catalysis are targeted by chymostatin.\",\r\n        \"In conclusion, we demonstrate a development and application of a FRET norovirus protease (GI and GII) assay with high-throughput capability for screening potential antiviral compounds and monitoring enzymatic reactions, and the interaction of chymostatin and norovirus protease by NMR spectroscopy. These results provide valuable information for the study of antivirals and enzyme activities.\",\r\n        \"Full-lengths codon-optimized cDNAs corresponding to the complete amino acid sequence of NVpro and MD145pro were synthesized and cloned into the pET28a vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). The synthesized cDNA sequences include start and stop codons as well as sequences encoding N-terminal six H for Ni column purification. The plasmid encoding NVpro or MD145pro was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Each protein was expressed in a regular Luria-Bertani broth by induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37 C° in a shaking incubator. The harvested cells were sonicated and ultracentifuged. Both proteases were soluble and the supernatants were applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) for purification. The mutant NVpro with C (nucleophile) to A substitution at position 139 (C139A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All proteins were monomers with a size of approximately 20 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 9\\n), which is in contrast to previous reports that norovirus proteases stably formed a dimer (NVpro) or were predominantly dimeric in solution (Southampton virus protease) (Hussey et al., 2011, Zeitler et al., 2006). Interestingly, our preliminary x-ray crystallography revealed NVpro as dimers, suggesting that the His-tag at the N-terminus does not interfere with dimerization (data not shown). These results indicate that the concentration and/or condition of the prepared protease may influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium of NVpro.\",\r\n        \"For NMR studies, uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro was expressed in the E. coli BL21 cells grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with 1 g/L 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and purified as previously described (Takahashi et al., 2011). Briefly, the cells containing the expression plasmid encoding NVpro were grown in a starter culture consisting of 50 ml Luria Bertani media at 37 °C for 6–8 h. The cells were then grown in M9 minimal media to an OD600 value of 1.0 and induced with 1.0 mM IPTG for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, subsequently resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM imidazole, and sonicated at 4 °C. After centrifugation of the cell lysates, NVpro was purified from the cell lysate supernatant using a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 prep grade (GE healthcare, Amersham, UK) was applied as a final purification step. Gel-filtration standard (Biorad, Hercules, CA) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) was used to analyze the molecular weight of the eluted proteins. NMR samples contained uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro (0.1–0.6 mM), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 3 mM NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O unless otherwise noted.\",\r\n        \"Two fluorogenic substrates, edans-EPDFHLQGPEDLAK-dabcyl (Zeitler et al., 2006) and edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl derived from the P7–P7′ and P5-P2′ residues on the NS2/3 cleavage site in ORF1 of NV, respectively, were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). The designation of substrate residues for P1 and P1′ starts at the scissile bond and counts toward the N- or C-terminus, respectively, as suggested by Schechter and Berger (1967).\",\r\n        \"Stock solutions (10 mM) of the substrates were prepared in DMSO, and diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES buffer [pH 8.0] containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 60% Glycerol, and 6 mM DTT). The 25 μl of protease (0.5 μM, final concentration) was mixed with 25 μl of serially diluted substrates in assay buffer in a 96-well black plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). The fluorescence signals were detected using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800, Biotek, Winooski, VT) every 5 min for 30 min at 37 °C.\",\r\n        \"The background (substrate control well without protease)-subtracted relative fluorescence units (RFU) were corrected for inner filter effects. The inner filter effects are produced at higher substrate concentrations due to the absorption of fluorescence by the quencher on the adjacent substrates, and cause attenuation of fluorescence intensity, abolishing the linear correlation between the cleaved substrate concentration and the fluorescence intensity (Cuerrier et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007). Briefly, serially diluted edans reference standards (free edans) were added to wells in a 96-well plate with or without equal concentration of substrate, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader. The correction factors to compensate for the inner filter effects were determined empirically as described previously (Cuerrier et al., 2005, Jaulent et al., 2007).\",\r\n        \"The corrected RFU was converted to the concentration of the product of protease reaction by plotting edans fluorescence reference standard as RFU versus concentration. The initial velocities (Vo), rate of enzyme reaction, were calculated using the first 30 min of the progress curve, and plotted against substrate concentrations (Michaelis–Menten plot) using GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine the ratio of kcat/km, which is the measure of efficiency of the catalytic reaction (specificity constant).\",\r\n        \"The substrate edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl (16 μM, final concentration) was added to wells containing NVpro at 0.5 μM of final concentration (positive control wells) or assay buffer (negative control wells) in a 96-well black plate.

The DMSO concentrations varied between 0% and 6% (v/v) at otherwise constant conditions. Fluorescence was measured following incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate to determine the effect of DMSO on enzyme activity.\",\r\n        \"Commercially available standard protease inhibitors including serine protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone [TPCK], and tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone [TLCK]) and a papain-like cysteine protease inhibitor (antipain) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Stock solutions (10 mM) of inhibitors were prepared in DMSO, and further diluted in assay buffer. The final concentrations of DMSO in the assay did not exceed 1.5% (vol/vol). NVpro and MD145pro at a final concentration of 0.5 μM and the substrate (edans-DFHLQGP-dabcyl) at 16 μM that give a strong signal and minimal inner filter effects were used for the studies. Inhibitors at a final concentration of 50 μM were pre-incubated with NVpro or MD145pro in 25 μl for 30 min at 37 °C, and the same volume of substrate was added to a 96-well black plate, followed by incubation. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader after 60 min of incubation. The substrate concentration used for pilot screening was well below the km, but substrate depletion was not observed in the control well (without an inhibitor) during 60 min incubation time. The reduction of cleaved products by each preparation was calculated by the comparison to that of control without any inhibitor.\",\r\n        \"Continuous monitoring of activity kinetics of NVpro and MD145pro was performed to evaluate the detailed efficacy of chymostatin. Proteases (0.5 μM, final concentration) were mixed with serially diluted chymostatin (0–50 μM) in 25 μl of assay buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of various concentrations of substrates (30–100 μM). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader at every 5 min for up to 30 min. The RFUs were corrected for inner filter effects and converted to the concentration of the product of protease reaction. The dissociation constant for inhibitor binding (Ki) values was determined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. The dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with variable slope (four parameters) using GraphPad Prism software in order to determine the concentration of chymostatin that reduces enzyme velocity by half (IC50). The IC50 values were determined in the presence of substrate at 30 μM at 60 min.\",\r\n        \"All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Varian VNMR 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm triple resonance inverse detection cryogenic NMR probe. All NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995), and analyzed with Sparky (Goddard and Kneller, 2006) and CARA software (http://www.nmr.ch) (Keller, 2004). Inhibitor titration experiments were carried out by direct addition of 10 mM stock solution of chymostatin dissolved in DMSO-d6 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) into uniformly 15N-labeled NVpro solution. 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of NVpro were monitored during addition of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 M equivalents of chymostatin. Complex points 1024 × 128 and spectral widths of 14 × 38 ppm were used to record all the spectra. Recently we have reported a total of 94% of the backbone 1H and 15N resonance assignments of free NVpro (Takahashi et al., 2011). The assignment of the HSQC spectra in the presence of chymostatin was used to investigate the interaction with the inhibitor by following the peak shifts during titration. Since the use of DMSO-d6 as a co-solvent caused a slight but traceable resonance peak shifts in dose-dependent manner, the titrations were repeated with DMSO-d6 alone. Each spectrum with varying amount of chymostatin was compared with that of DMSO-d6 at a corresponding titration point. As a control, similar experiments were repeated using an unrelated compound dissolved in DMSO-d6 that does not inhibit NVpro activity (PB compound). Chemical shift changes were characterized using a weighted chemical shift difference (Δδ − [1/2{δH\\n2\\n + 1/25δN\\n2}]1/2) (Grzesiek et al., 1996).\",\r\n        \"The docking models of NVpro in complex with chymostatin were built using the HADDOCK (high-ambiguity driven biomolecular docking) program (de Vries et al, Dominguez et al., 2003), in which the experimental information on residues involved in intermolecular interaction can be used as ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking. Protein residues directly involved in intermolecular interaction are defined as “active residues”, while neighboring residues of active residues as “passive residues”. HADDOCK docking protocols consist of three-stage procedure, a rigid-body energy minimization, a semi-flexible refinement in torsion angle space and a final refinement in explicit solvent. Crystal structure of NVpro (PDB code: 2FYQ) (Zeitler et al., 2006) was used as the starting structure. NVpro residues showing peak disappearance or chemical shift perturbation greater than the average shift value, 0.019 ppm, in 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of NVpro with chymostatin and possessing higher solvent accessibility were selected as active residues. Solvent accessibility was calculated using GETAREA (Robert Fraczkiewicz, 1998), where residues are defined as solvent exposed when the ratio of side-chain surface area to its random coil value exceeds 50%. All solvent accessible surface neighbors of active residues were then defined as passive residues in the docking calculation. Whole residues of the small ligand, chymostatin, were selected as active residues. Initially, a total of 1000 structures were calculated at the rigid body minimization stage. From this calculation, the 200 lowest-energy structures were then selected for the subsequent semi-flexible simulated annealing and the refinement in explicit solvent. The final structures were clustered using the backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with a cutoff of 7.5 Å. All the structures were drawn with the PyMol (DeLano).\",\r\n        \"The student t-test was used to compare the significance of the unpaired sample means.

With the population in Europe aged 85 years and above projected to rise from 14 million currently to 19 million by 2020 and to 40 million by 2050, and the expectation that more than 30% of European citizens will be aged over 60 years by 2050, the proportion of the population in countries at all levels of development which requires long‐term care is only set to increase dramatically over the coming decades.2\\n\",\r\n        \"Outbreaks of seasonal influenza in LTCFs are well recognised, as are the challenges of preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks in these settings. The development of universally applicable guidance on the prevention and control of influenza and other respiratory viruses in LTCFs is difficult due to the huge variation in the size of facilities, patient characteristics, the intensity of care provided and resources available. Although some countries have produced guidance on IPC for use specifically in LTCFs,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 most have not. To help fill this gap, the WHO has recently published a best practice guidance document to support managers of LTCFs in the 53 WHO European Region Member States and which can be tailored according to national and local circumstances12 ( http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/330225/LTCF-best-practice-guidance.pdf?ua=1).\",\r\n        \"In this review, we examine the impact of seasonal influenza in LTCFs, and approaches to the prevention and control of outbreaks, as outlined by the advice and evidence we provided in the WHO best practice document.\",\r\n        \"Persons residing in LTCFs present a population very susceptible to the acquisition and spread of infectious diseases and for whom the consequences of infection may be serious. Nursing home residents are at greatest risk due to their overall frailty, close quarter living arrangements, shared caregivers, and opportunities for introduction of healthcare‐associated infections and the spread of pathogens to other facilities through resident transfers and the movement of staff and visitors in and out of the home.13, 14\\n\",\r\n        \"Outbreaks of influenza caused by both influenza A and B viruses are well documented in LTCFs, and may be explosive,15 with high mortality, highlighting the need for early recognition and prompt initiation of control measures. Accurate measurement of the burden of influenza is heavily influenced by circulating types and subtypes of virus and may vary between communities and between institutions so studies that attempt to estimate this burden require temporal, geographical and institutional breadth.16 Older studies, relying on culture‐based detection techniques, may have underestimated total burden. A review of 206 published infectious outbreaks in elderly care facilities across 19 countries over 40 years identified 37 different pathogens, but influenza viruses caused the largest number of outbreaks (23%).17 In the 49 outbreaks caused by influenza, the median attack rate in residents was 33% (range 4‐94%), and 23% (range 3‐58%) among staff, with a median case‐fatality rate for residents of 6.5% (range 0‐55%). Over three consecutive 9‐year time periods between 1980 and 2008, there was no observed decrease in attack rates or case‐fatality rates; nevertheless, these data should be interpreted cautiously as antiviral use and the stringency of application of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices has changed over time.\",\r\n        \"Exposure to influenza in residents of LTCFs for the elderly increases their risk of respiratory‐origin hospitalisation (relative risk [RR] 1.43 [95% CI 0.99‐2.08]), and particularly increases the risk of death due to a respiratory cause (RR 2.77 [95% CI 1.55 to 4.91]) compared to unexposed residents, despite high levels of vaccination among the residents (93%).18\\n\",\r\n        \"Bronchitis and pneumonia, either primary influenza pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, are the most common respiratory complications of influenza infection, but infection may also cause extrapulmonary cardiovascular, neurological and musculoskeletal manifestations. In a retrospective cohort study of nursing home residents in 381 nursing homes across three seasons, estimated for the 63% of residents with comorbid conditions, influenza contributed to approximately 28 hospitalisations, 147 courses of antibiotics and 15 deaths per 1000 person‐years annually; a higher burden than residents without comorbid conditions but in whom there were still seven hospitalisations, 99 excess antibiotic prescriptions and six deaths per 1000 residents annually.16 Increased age itself is a recognised risk factor for serious influenza infection. A systematic review evaluating populations at risk of severe influenza‐related illness found that for seasonal influenza (H3N2 or type B), there was raised risk of hospitalisation (odds ratio [OR] 4.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.74 to 12.41) and risk of death (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.70) among elderly people (>65 years) compared with non‐elderly people.19 Modelling studies suggest that the burden on the health services is particularly onerous for those aged 75 and above, with an estimated 36% of all influenza‐attributable respiratory hospitalisations and 74% of all influenza‐associated deaths occurring in this age group in the UK over 13 seasons,20 and accounting for 52% of total hospital bed occupancy and 69% of excess bed days occupancy in England over a similar number of seasons.21\\nKey Points 1\\nLTCFs are susceptible to seasonal influenza outbreaks, which may be explosive and with high attack rates in residents.Written IPC policies, vaccination policies for residents and staff, provision of ongoing staff IPC training and the facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices should be in place throughout the year.Although influenza vaccine efficacy is lower in the elderly and in the presence of comorbidities compared to healthy younger adults, vaccination of LTCF residents remains a major public health tool and is recommended.Vaccination of LTCF staff is recommended and should be encouraged. Although evidence for a protective effect of HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly is weak, HCW vaccination can help to protect themselves, maintain the workforce during an outbreak and act as a barrier to transmission of infection to the vulnerable.\\n\\n\",\r\n        \"Outbreaks of influenza (and other respiratory virus pathogens) in LTCFs in the Northern Hemisphere occur most commonly during the winter but may occur at any time of year, particularly in the autumn months, usually due to circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and before seasonal vaccination campaigns have been fully implemented or when matching is poor; also in the spring when influenza B often peaks22 and when antibody titres may have declined in the vaccinated.23, 24\\n\",\r\n        \"Influenza virus replicates in the epithelium of the upper and lower respiratory tract, with infected hosts releasing virus into the environment during breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing, producing a spray of virus‐containing particles ranging in size from 0.01 to 500 μm.25 Transmission of influenza may occur by three routes: droplet (larger‐sized particles too large to be inhaled into the lungs and which settle quickly to the ground or other surface within 2 m of the source); aerosol or droplet nuclei (small particles <5 μm which can remain suspended in the air much longer and are potentially inhalable into the lower respiratory tract); and contact (transfer of infectious particles to the mucous membranes directly or indirectly through contaminated objects). The relative importance of each of these routes in influenza transmission is unclear, and the contribution of aerosolised infectious droplet nuclei has been particularly contentious.26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 However, most influenza transmission is short‐range, and when it has occurred over longer distances, contact transmission has generally not been ruled out.32 Transmission studies often do not control for confounders such as vaccination status, handwashing practice, supershedders, amount of coughing, ward layout, surface contamination and ventilation,33 and further studies which control for these are required in this area.\",\r\n        \"The incubation period of influenza is typically short, usually reported as ranging from 1 to 4 days,34 with a serial interval (time between symptom onset in a secondary case and that of its primary case) of 2.2 to 3.5 days for influenza A and 3.4 to 4.9 days for influenza B.35 The relatively short incubation period and serial interval enables the virus to spread rapidly through communities, so mitigation measures such as isolation and transmission‐based precautions should be instigated as soon as a case of suspected influenza is identified to minimise the risk of transmission to contacts.\",\r\n        \"Viral shedding has generally been considered to be a proxy for influenza infectiousness,36, 37, 38 peaking 1 to 3 days after symptom onset with most healthy volunteers clearing virus by day 6 to day 7.34 However, a recent study of household influenza transmission found at most only a weak association between viral load in nose and throat swabs and infectivity, possibly due to the weak correlation between virus concentration in exhaled breath and nose and throat samples, or due to the intensity of household transmission so that even those with low viral loads are still capable of infecting those around them.39 Pre‐symptomatic shedding may occur in up to one‐third of cases,40, 41, 42, 43 and prolonged viral shedding has been reported in children,42, 44, 45 in patients hospitalised with severe influenza46 and in immunocompromised patients,47 in whom prolonged shedding may last weeks or even months.48, 49 The transmission dynamics of influenza infections in residents of LTCFs have not been studied; age >65 years and the presence of major comorbidities were associated with prolonged shedding of virus and higher viral load in a prospective observational study of hospitalised influenza patients46; these findings may raise the possibility of prolonged shedding in LTCF residents.\",\r\n        \"Transmission of influenza from healthcare workers (HCWs) to hospital patients, including those in geriatric facilities, has been well documented using epidemiological linkage, nucleotide sequence analysis and contact tracking data50, 51, 52, 53 and case reports of outbreaks of influenza‐like illness in care facilities indicate that staff can transmit the virus to residents.54, 55 A systematic review comparing the incidence of influenza in HCWs with other workers not working in a healthcare setting and taking vaccination status into account, found estimated incidence rates (IRs) for all influenza infections (defined as a ≥4‐fold increase in antibody titre over the influenza season and including asymptomatic infections) of 18.7/100 population/season (95% CI 15.8 to 22.1) for unvaccinated HCWs and 6.5/100 population/season (95% CI 4.6 to 9.0) for vaccinated HCWs, both higher than the IRs in unvaccinated and vaccinated other workers (5.4/100 population/season [95% CI 3.0 to 9.8] and 1.2 [95% CI 0.9 to 1.7] respectively).56 However, no difference was observed between IRs for symptomatic infection confirmed serologically in HCWs compared to other workers; this overall lack of consistency in findings between overall and symptomatic infections indicates the need for cautious interpretation. The observed variability might be explained by HCWs being at higher risk of asymptomatic or subclinical infection, indicating that HCWs may act as an infective pool to transmit influenza to frail elderly people. Furthermore, a study of HCWs in an acute hospital during a mild epidemic season, found that 23% had serological evidence of new influenza infection during the season, implying a potential transmission risk to patients as between 28% and 59% of infected workers had subclinical infections and continued to work.57 Although the role of asymptomatic people and those with only mild symptoms in spreading influenza is uncertain, HCWs often continue to work despite having symptoms and may act as a source of infection to those in their care.58, 59, 60 Nursing home aides in particular have been shown in one Swedish study to be the occupational group at significantly greatest risk of continuing to work despite the feeling that, in the light of their perceived state of health, they should have taken sick leave.61 However, in reality the employment status of many LTCF staff is often precarious and taking unpaid sick leave may result in adverse economic consequences.\",\r\n        \"LTCFs have a broad staff base and may include people with little or no formal healthcare training. Depending upon the type of facility and the nursing needs of the residents, services are provided by a range of staff including care assistants with few formal healthcare qualifications, registered nurses, domestic staff, catering and administrative staff, with additional ambulatory health services usually provided by external contractors such as general practitioners (GPs) and other healthcare professionals not directly affiliated to the facility. Managers of LTCFs have an important role in ensuring that all staff have ongoing training on the importance and practice of IPC, and that the facilities are available for IPC measures to be implemented to a satisfactory level and with standard precautions being used at all times, regardless of the detection of a suspected outbreak. Written policies should be in place in every LTCF outlining: resident and staff influenza immunisation policy; a written outbreak management plan which includes outbreak recognition (definitions, thresholds for suspicion of an outbreak), identification of communication channels, operational measures including active surveillance, staff contingency plans, visitor restriction policies, and consideration of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis strategy; a policy for ill staff to remain off work; a policy for dealing with visitors with symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection.\",\r\n        \"During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak, compliance with IPC measures was found to be associated with HCWs’ perception that the facilities in which they worked had clear IPC policies and protocols, and that the management had a positive attitude towards occupational health and safety and provided training in IPC practices.62 Managers in LTCFs therefore have a pivotal role in creating a strong institutional climate in which staff feel valued, with continuous accessibility to the training resources, clear IPC policies and supplies and facilities required to promote compliance with IPC practices.\",\r\n        \"A WHO strategy and action plan for healthy ageing in Europe 2012‐2020 recognised the benefit of proper vaccination strategies against infectious diseases, including influenza, both in older people and for health and social care workers in contact with them, and proposed priority interventions including national immunisation schedules and the implementation of infectious disease control programmes in institutions.63 Furthermore, a WHO position paper published in 2012 recommended that elderly persons ≥65 years and people with specific chronic diseases should be considered for influenza vaccination.64 Vaccination coverage of the elderly varies considerably between European countries with recent uptake rates reported between 1% and 77.4% and with only two countries (the Netherlands and the UK) achieving, or almost achieving, the WHO target of 75% coverage in the elderly.65 For residents of LTCFs, recent data available from only three countries indicated vaccination coverage rates of 71% to 89%.65\\n\",\r\n        \"Vaccination of residents remains an important public health tool to protect the elderly and those with underlying conditions, but there is uncertainty about how effective immunisation is at an individual level in LTCF residents. A systematic review assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in people 65 years or over, with separate analyses for those living in nursing homes and community dwelling older people,66 concluded that for elderly people living in closed communities vaccination may be slightly to moderately more effective than no vaccination at preventing influenza‐like illness (ILI) (24% [95% CI 12‐34%]), pneumonia (47% [95% CI 34‐57%]), hospitalisation (49% [19‐68%]), overall mortality (60% [95% CI 23‐79%]) and mortality from influenza or pneumonia (54% [95% CI 37‐67%]), although no significant protective effect against proven influenza was found. A later systematic review67 also found that vaccination may have a small significant protective effect against pneumonia (37% [95% CI 18‐53%]) and mortality from influenza and pneumonia (34% [95% CI 10‐53%]), in institutionalised older adults ≥60 years; also a trend towards protection against ILI (21% [95% CI −3 to 39%]). The authors did not address the effectiveness of vaccination against all‐cause mortality and, due to an insufficient number of studies, were unable to perform meta‐analyses for laboratory‐confirmed influenza or hospitalisation. The quality of the evidence is very weak in both reviews and does not definitively answer the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in older people living in LTCFs. In particular, selection bias may occur by targeting the frail for immunisation; conversely people who are particularly frail or close to death may not receive vaccine resulting in overestimation of the effectiveness of vaccine on mortality (healthy recipient effect).68, 69 Although there is some indirect evidence of influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalisation, pneumonia and death from studies which have controlled for multiple confounders and compared summer and winter mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated elderly people,70, 71 accurate proof of IVE requires adequately powered studies using laboratory‐confirmed outcomes, in which confounders are controlled for and which comprehensively monitor morbidity and mortality.72\\n\",\r\n        \"Infection in HCWs affects not only themselves and their immediate family but may further inhibit efforts to control an outbreak if staff shortages result in remaining staff having to care for both affected and unaffected residents.73 On this basis HCWs are recognised as a priority group for vaccination and are generally recommended to receive it.64, 74\\n\",\r\n        \"High rates of staff vaccination in LTCFs have been demonstrated in several studies to decrease the risk of all‐cause mortality and ILI in frail elderly residents, with lowest rates when both HCWs and patients had high vaccine coverage rates.75, 76, 77, 78, 79 This has been somewhat refuted by a systematic review of four cluster‐randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one cohort study which suggested that offering vaccination to HCW caring for people aged over 60 in LTCFs may have little or no effect on laboratory‐confirmed influenza (LCI) (Risk difference (RD) 0 (95% CI −0.03 to 0.03) and respiratory‐related hospitalisation in residents (RD 0 (95% CI −0.02 to 0.02), although there may be a small decrease in lower respiratory infections from 6% to 4% in homes where HCW vaccination is offered (RD −0.02 [95% CI −0.04 to 0.01]).80 The effects on deaths due to LRTI and all‐cause mortality were not evaluated by meta‐analysis, but reductions in all‐cause mortality were noted in the individual studies (ORs ranging from 0.56 [95% CI 0.4‐0.8] to 0.80 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.97]).75, 76, 77, 79 The authors called for high quality RCTs to address methodological flaws they identified in the included studies, and to test the effectiveness of co‐interventions such as handwashing and face‐mask use in combination with HCW vaccination. Another systematic review81 found a significant reduction in ILI and all‐cause mortality in residents associated with vaccination of HCWs (42% and 29% reductions respectively), but no significant reductions for laboratory‐confirmed influenza or all‐cause hospitalisations. Overall the authors rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate for the different outcomes, and concluded that HCW influenza vaccination can enhance patient safety. Protective effects of HCW vaccination against non‐specific outcomes may be an indication of unaccounted cluster biases, such as differences in handwashing or other IPC precautions and warrants further investigation.82 Evidence from observational and modelling studies suggests a likely proportionate effect of HCW vaccination coverage on patient protection, although no clear threshold for HCW vaccine uptake above which the protective effect on residents increases substantially has been established.83, 84, 85, 86, 87\\n\",\r\n        \"Inactivated trivalent vaccines have been found to have a protective effect against proven influenza in healthy adults (overall protective effect in vaccine‐matched and poorly matched seasons 62% [95% CI 56‐67%]).88 A systematic review specifically addressing the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in HCWs found just one study reporting laboratory‐confirmed influenza in this group with a reported IVE of 88% (95% CI 59% to 96%, P=.0005).89\\n\",\r\n        \"Although the currently available evidence may be weak for HCW vaccination to protect the frail and elderly, there is also generally no evidence against it. Therefore, it remains a biologically plausible intervention to provide individual protection to the HCW, act as a barrier against spread of infection and to help reduce the risk associated with influenza infection and prevent staff absenteeism. However, poor vaccine uptake by HCWs has been well documented. In Europe, coverage of HCWs (including those working in LTCFs) varies between countries and is generally much lower than for other vaccination targeted groups, ranging from 9.5% to 75% with a median vaccination coverage rate of 28.6%.65 In the United States, vaccination rates of 50‐70% have been reported for LTCF workers,78, 90, 91 with coverage consistently lower than among staff working in hospital settings.91 Reasons given for declining vaccination include fear of side effects, lack of concern or perception of risk, doubts about vaccine efficacy, lack of availability or inconvenient delivery of vaccine, avoidance of medications and dislike of injections.92 Although mandatory vaccination is effective if it can be implemented,93 it is not legally enforceable in all countries and settings, and infection rates after the implementation of mandatory vaccination have not been studied. The United States Department of Health and Human Services advocates a 90% HCW vaccination rate by 2020 but as yet there have been no RCTs of transmission with very high HCW vaccination rates.33 Data suggest that other interventions such as easier access to vaccine, educational activities, reminders and organisational changes can increase uptake in proportion to the number of interventional components, although most studies have only evaluated their effect on a short‐term basis whereas long‐term intervention programmes will be necessary to demonstrate a sustainable effect on uptake.94 To address low uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in priority target groups, a project called TIP FLU was initiated in 2013 by the WHO Influenza and other Respiratory Pathogens programme. Adapted from the Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) approach, it is based on social and behavioural change models and provides tools to identify priority populations, determine barriers and enablers to vaccination, and to implement evidence‐based interventions. A guide and case study of the application of TIP FLU in Montenegro have been published to assist policymakers and programme managers to increase vaccine uptake among HCWs.95, 96\\n\",\r\n        \"Early recognition of influenza in residents of LTCFs may be problematic due to non‐specific symptoms and the possibility of atypical presentation and lack of fever in the elderly with influenza.97, 98 Influenza may present as sudden, unexplained deterioration in physical or mental ability or exacerbation of an underlying condition with no other known cause.15 The use of surveillance case definitions for ILI in these populations may therefore miss cases, especially if they present without fever. Furthermore, other underlying conditions may impair residents’ abilities to verbalise their symptoms. This may impede the early implementation of control and treatment strategies.99 The precise definition of ILI may vary from country to country; the WHO global surveillance case definition of ILI is an acute respiratory infection with measured fever ≥38°C and cough and onset within the last 10 days,100 whereas that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) definition is sudden onset of symptoms and at least one of four systematic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) and at least one of three respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath).3, 101\\n\",\r\n        \"To confirm an outbreak, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or viral culture are the preferred methods of laboratory testing. Rapid point‐of‐care diagnostic tests can produce a result within 30 minutes but have lower sensitivity (median 70‐75%)102 and there may be variability between different age groups and influenza subtypes,103 although they may still be useful in outbreak situations, for example for rapid identification of influenza infection where timely access to more sensitive laboratory testing is unavailable or delayed. However, clinical judgement is required to interpret negative rapid test results for individual patients during an outbreak and negative rapid test results may not justify delaying the instigation of outbreak control measures if there is clinical and epidemiological suspicion.\",\r\n        \"Early recognition of an influenza outbreak in a LTCF can facilitate timely antiviral treatment and prophylaxis to end the outbreak and thus avoid influenza‐related complications in exposed residents. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently authorised for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in Europe and the United States. However, their effectiveness has been subject to much debate113 and many clinicians have felt confused about when to use them appropriately.\",\r\n        \"A modest but significant reduction in time to first alleviation of symptoms has been consistently shown in meta‐analyses of RCTs of previously healthy people, representing a 10 to 15% reduction in overall duration of symptoms in those treated with an NAI compared with those receiving placebo,114, 115, 116 with similar reductions noted from analysis of observational studies.117 This effect appears to be somewhat attenuated in the elderly.115, 118 In general there is a lack of credible evidence from RCTs that NAIs reduce the risk of hospitalisation and pneumonia,114, 115, 118 although a significant reduction was seen in hospitalisation in the influenza‐confirmed intention‐to‐treat population in one analysis (RR 0.37 [95% CI 0.17 to 0.81]),115 and reduced rates of lower respiratory tract complications were seen in two meta‐analyses (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.42 to 0.75]115 and 0.55 [95% CI 0.33 to 0.90]).114 However, RCTs are generally underpowered to evaluate the effects of treatment on complications due to the rarity of such events, and lack of precise outcome definition in many trials makes comparison of findings difficult. Meta‐analysis of observational studies indicated a potential effect of oseltamivir in reducing hospitalisation in the general population (all ages) compared with no antiviral (OR 0.75 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.89]), but no significant effect was found for inhaled zanamivir (OR 0.66 [95% CI 0.37 to 1.18]).117 Individual patient data meta‐analysis from 29 234 people of all ages hospitalised with 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza showed that deaths were reduced when treated with NAIs within 48 hours of onset (OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70 to 0.93]), supporting the use of early NAI treatment in those who require hospitalisation.119 A reduction in mortality risk for patients receiving oseltamivir compared to those not given antivirals was also noted in a meta‐analysis of three observational studies (OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.43]) but the quality of evidence was low, and related only to oseltamivir.117\\n\",\r\n        \"Uncertainties remain about the effectiveness of treatment in high‐risk populations such as LTCF residents as much of the available evidence relates to previously healthy younger adults. However, given the high risk of severe complications and deaths among the elderly from influenza virus infection, where influenza antivirals are available, treatment of symptomatic LTCF residents is generally recommended to be started immediately.3, 120\\n\",\r\n        \"Prophylaxis with antivirals is intended to prevent transmission of influenza virus to people who are not exhibiting ILI but who have or may have been exposed. There is a paucity of evidence from recent studies to inform a single approach for antiviral prophylaxis use in LTCFs, so decisions should be based on clinical judgement and outbreak severity.121 Prophylaxis with oseltamivir or zanamivir was shown to be more effective than placebo at preventing symptomatic influenza in individuals in the community (oseltamivir RR 0.45 [95% CI 0.30 to 0.67]; zanamivir RR 0.39 [95% CI 0.22 to 0.70]) and in household contacts (oseltamivir RR 0.20 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.44]; zanamivir RR 0.33 [95% CI 0.18 to 0.58]) in a recent meta‐analysis of RCTs.114 A reduced risk of LCI with oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis was found in a further systematic review which also included data from observational studies, for both individuals (oseltamivir OR 0.11 [95% CI 0.06 to 0.20]; zanamivir OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.16 to 0.35]) and households (oseltamivir OR 0.23 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.59]; zanamivir OR 0.18 [95% CI 0.10 to 0.31]).122 However, direct evidence of effectiveness in reducing symptomatic influenza in the frail elderly living in institutions is sparse; a non‐significant protective trend with post‐exposure zanamivir prophylaxis has been shown in one study (RR 0.08 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.63])123 but data for the effectiveness of post‐exposure oseltamivir in this setting are lacking.124 Other studies have seen a non‐significant effect of post‐exposure prophylaxis and seasonal prophylaxis with zanamivir.124, 125\\n\",\r\n        \"Prophylaxis for all residents in LTCFs experiencing an outbreak, regardless of vaccination status is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)3; the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) expert opinion on the use of antivirals for prophylaxis recommends consideration of antiviral prophylaxis for residents of LTCFs, especially for those who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised who do not respond to vaccination.126 This may be particularly important during years when IVE is expected to be low due to vaccine strain mismatch. But the relatively low effectiveness of influenza vaccine in the elderly population even in well‐matched years should also be taken into consideration.\",\r\n        \"There is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of giving prophylaxis to HCWs in LTCFs. The CDC recommends consideration of prophylaxis for unvaccinated HCWs caring for people at high risk of complications, and for all employees regardless of vaccination status if an outbreak is due to a strain which is poorly matched to the current vaccine strains.3 To protect vulnerable people, ECDC also recommends consideration of prophylaxis for HCWs, particularly when low IVE is expected due to strain mismatch.120 As IVE is lower in those who are elderly and frail than in younger healthy people, it would seem prudent to have a low threshold for offering prophylaxis to those caring for them, and particularly so if chains of transmission from a resident to staff are described; or from a resident to staff to resident.\",\r\n        \"Seasonal influenza infection outbreaks are a significant problem in LTCFs both in terms of morbidity and mortality for individuals as well as putting additional strain on already overburdened health services. With an increasingly elderly population, the demand for LTCFs is likely increase over the coming years. Many basic and clinical questions remain unanswered about the transmission, prevention and treatment of influenza in these institutions and further evidence is needed to determine which interventions, or combination of interventions and hygiene practices are most efficacious in these settings. Although vaccination for residents and staff forms the cornerstone of preventive influenza policy in LTCFs, and vaccine coverage is high among residents in some countries, currently available vaccines are less effective in older people and those with comorbidities. Vaccination coverage among HCWs caring for residents of LTCFs is generally much lower than for those in other priority groups and efforts are required to improve this to protect the vulnerable, the individual HCW and the workforce. Although further studies of the efficacy of antiviral treatment and prophylaxis in LTCF setting are required, available data suggest that antivirals should be used early during the course of infection for treatment of residents and considered for prophylaxis during suspected or confirmed influenza outbreaks to reduce secondary transmission. The prevention and control of influenza in LTCFs requires a multifaceted approach; vaccination and antiviral policies form an important part of this, but strong managerial leadership, outbreak planning, and a well‐trained, educated and engaged workforce are pivotal to the successful implementation of IPC policies.\",\r\n        \"J.S.N‐V‐T. reports grants from World Health Organization, during the conduct of the study; and grants from F.

According to statistical data, construction and expansion are expected to continue through 2050 with 1.8 − 2.0 billion m2 of floor space every year [2]. These new buildings raise public concerns regarding indoor air quality (IAQ) associated with higher levels of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [3]. A field survey in Hangzhou, China revealed that the average concentration of formaldehyde (HCHO) in new residential buildings after decoration is 9 times higher than the threshold from World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. The dramatic increase of HCHO in indoor environment greatly enhances the risk of exposure risk to human beings that reside in the dwelling. It is hypothesized that significant exposure to high levels of HCHO has contributed to childhood leukemia incidents in China [5], [6]. As an ordinary but effective solution, natural ventilation is being applied to remove or dilute gaseous pollutants in new decorated buildings [7]. In particular, single-sided natural ventilation is more common than cross-ventilation in practice, and can readily satisfy fire codes, security issues and privacy concerns [8].\",\r\n        \"Single-sided natural ventilation uses openings in the form of windows or ventilation devices on the facade to allow outdoor air to enter and indoor air to leave from the same or different opening [9]. Due to the unique airflow paths created by single-sided ventilation, air can flow between households on different floors in multistory buildings [10]. As a result, there is the possibility of cross-infection via airflow between multistory households if the IAQ of one household is not within the recommended safe limits. Cross-infection was initially found during the outbreak of Smallpox in a German hospital [11]. During the worldwide epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003 [12], [13], [14], cross-infection contributed to the spread of the infectious disease. The SARS virus was found in rooms and windows where residents did not suffer from the disease [15]. It was shown that airborne transmission in certain conditions greatly contributed to the cross-infection of pandemic viruses in residential buildings [16]. With IAQ requirements, greenhouses gases deteriorating the atmosphere, and other environmental concerns, more attention should be focused to reduce pollutant cross-transmission in buildings.\",\r\n        \"The airborne transmission of pollutants is often driven by three forces, namely, the buoyancy force, wind force and their combination [17]. Niu and Tung [16] employed carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as tracer gases to measure the amount of the exhausted air re-entering upper floor windows due to buoyancy effects. It was found that up to 7% of the exhausted air from the lower floor transferred to the adjacent upper floor. Liu et al. [18] numerically investigated the airborne transmission in a high-rise building with buoyancy-driven ventilation. The results revealed that the windows flush with the building facade became major paths of pollutant cross-transmission. To reduce pollutant transmission between floors, Wu and Niu [19] installed a mechanical exhaust system in each room with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation. It was shown that the outflow through the window was weakened when the mechanical exhaust was employed. If the mechanical exhaust rate was large enough, no indoor air escaped through the window. The two-way airflow through the window turned into one-way inflow, and thus re-entry risk was avoided. Lim et al. [20], [21] further confirmed the possibility of pollutant transmission from lower floors to upper floors through buoyancy-driven airflow by means of field measurement and numerical analysis in a hospital setting. Considering the variety of indoor pollutants, Gao et al. [22] utilized Lagrangian and Eulerian models to simulate particulate (pollutant) transmission between adjacent floors. It was concluded that the upward transmission closely depended on the size of the particulate. If the particulate sizes were larger than 20 μm, the upward transmission was limited by gravitational settling effects.\",\r\n        \"Compared to pollutant cross-transmission by buoyancy-driven airflow, wind-driven airflow is more complex because of the random nature of wind. Liu et al. [23], [24], [25] measured pollutant transmission and possible cross-infection based on a 1:30 scale model of a 10-story residential building in a wind tunnel. Experimental results indicated that vertical (bidirectional) and horizontal cross-transmission between adjacent flats were both observed. Furthermore, the impacts of transient characteristics of wind on pollutant cross-transmission should be considered when evaluating the risk of cross-infection. To perform accurate numerical predictions on indoor pollutant dispersion around a building, Liu et al. [26] compared three turbulence models based on a high-rise building with 33 floors and 8 units in a prescribed wind field. Obvious differences were observed among the turbulence models, and the simulations based on the realizable k\\n − \\nε model agreed best with experiments. Ai et al. [27], [28], [29] used the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model and the large eddy simulation (LES) model to quantify the dispersion of pollutants during wind-dominated conditions inside and outside a typical multistory building. The results indicated that the incident wind and the balcony created significant changes in the route of airborne transmission and the re-entry ratio of exhaust air.\",\r\n        \"Owing to the fact that pollutant cross-transmission does not always depend on one force, i.e., buoyancy-driven or wind-driven forces, the combination of these forces may transport pollutant between floors. Gao et al. [30] considered the combination of forces for pollutant cross-transmission in a high-rise building with single-sided natural ventilation. It was found that the wind could reinforce or suppress vertical cross-transmission of pollutants between floors, which was mainly attributed to wind speed and direction. Mao et al. [31] further extended the research in a 33-story building with closed doors and windows. The pollutant cross-transmission between floors was driven by buoyancy and wind effects together. The multi-zone model was developed to analyze pollutant spread in vertical and horizontal directions. The pollutant concentration on the upper floors was 3 − 4 orders of magnitude lower than that on the floor where the source was located. Though the research on pollutant cross-transmission via combined forces has been investigated, it is still far from being fully understood since the characteristics of airflow resulting from the interaction between buoyancy and wind has not been well explained [32].\",\r\n        \"The above review implies that most attention has focused on experimental measurements and numerical simulations to identify the possible routes of pollutant cross-transmission and quantify the amount of exhausted pollutants re-entering indoor environments. Due to the complex features of airflow inside and outside buildings, there are very few studies that investigate the impact of window configuration; real windows are simplified as rectangular openings. Our previous study demonstrated that there are significant thermal flow differences in natural ventilation with various window configurations [33], which should also affect pollutant cross-transmission accordingly. Therefore, the investigation herein aims to quantify gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in a multistory building with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation through variable window types. The sensitivities of re-entry ratios and infection risks for variable windows are analyzed and compared for pollutant cross-transmission.\",\r\n        \"To represent pollutant transmission between households through real windows in a multistory building, the geometrical model is illustrated in Fig. 1\\n. The three empty cavities represent rooms on different floors of a multistory building with dimensions of 2.5 m (L) × 3.5 m (W) × 3.2 m (H). Six types of windows that are common in residential buildings are installed on the facade of the building, which include the vertical slide window (VSW), tilt window (TILT), awning window (AW), horizontal pivot window (HPW), turn window (TURN) and vertical pivot window (VPW), as shown in Fig. 2\\n. The sizes of the window frames are identical, with dimensions of 1.23 m (w) × 1.48 m (h). The open area of each window style and corresponding open gap are summarized in Table 1\\n, and represent typical openings in practical conditions. Fig. 2(a) shows an example of the open area A and gap δ for the VSW style; for the other window styles, the gap is the base of the isosceles triangle. Furthermore, the openings of the same window type on each floor are identical for the same case. Since the airflow and pollutant dispersion near a window is of concern, the computational domain only includes the front region of the multistory building and wind is not considered [19]. The height of the computational domain is 12.8 m (4H), which is one floor higher than the building, and its length is 12.5 m (5L) which is large enough to ensure that the computational boundaries do not affect the windows. The pollutant source is located in the center of the first floor room, which is denoted by the character * in Fig. 1. The gaseous HCHO is assumed to be released by the source with a constant mass flow rate that ranges from 10 − 100 μg/s.\",\r\n        \"To characterize airflow and pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building, the governing equations of fluid flow, heat transfer and scalar transport are solved. Since the equations are widely available from published literature, the following briefly addresses the governing equations employed in the study.\",\r\n        \"The continuity, momentum and energy equations for an incompressible fluid are written as [34],(1)∇→⋅u→=0\\n(2)ρ(∂u→∂t+u→⋅∇→u→)=−∇→p+μ∇→2u→+ρg→\\n(3)∂T∂t+u→⋅∇→T=Kρcp∇→2Twhere u→ is the velocity vector, p is the pressure, T is the temperature, K is the thermal conductivity, g→ is the gravitational acceleration, ρ is the density, and μ is the absolute viscosity. The Boussinesq model is used to include buoyancy effects caused by variation of air density. It approximates the buoyancy term in Equation (2) as,(4)ρg→=ρref[1-β(T−Tref)]g→where ρ\\nref is the reference density, T\\nref is the operating temperature, and β is the thermal expansion coefficient.\",\r\n        \"In view of desirable performances in accuracy and stability when modeling turbulence, the BSL k-ω model is used to characterize turbulent airflow [35]. The mathematical descriptions of the BSL k-ω model are given by [36],(5)∂∂t(ρk)+∇→⋅(ρu→k)=∇→⋅(Γk∇→k)+Gk−Yk\\n(6)∂∂t(ρω)+∇→⋅(ρu→ω)=∇→⋅(Γω∇→ω)+Gω−Yω+Dωwhere k is the turbulence kinetic energy, ω is the specific dissipation rate, Гk and Гω represent the diffusivity of k and ω, Gk and Gω represent the generation of k and ω, Yk and Yω represent the dissipation of k and ω, and Dω represents the cross-diffusion term. More details about the BSL k\\n − \\nω model can be found in [33], [36].\",\r\n        \"Based on the airflow predicted by the mathematical models introduced above, one can continue to solve another equation to obtain characteristics of pollutant transmission in indoor and outdoor environment. Generally, there are two methods for modeling pollutant transmission, i.e., the Eulerian method and the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian method is usually applied to transiently track particle pollutants. Under steady state conditions, both methods can provide reasonable results, while the Eulerian method requires less computing time than the Lagrangian method [37]. Since the densities of air and gaseous HCHO are similar, they can be considered as a passive pollutant. Therefore, the Eulerian method is suitable to quantify passive pollutant transmission. The following scalar transport equation is utilized to model the pollutant transmission [34],(7)∇→⋅(ρu→C)=∇→⋅(ΓC∇→C)+SCwhere C is the concentration of the scalar (HCHO), SC is the source term, and ГC is the scalar diffusivity as proposed by Zhang et al. [38] where ГC\\n = (μ + μ\\nt)/St for St = 1.0. Further details on the scalar transport equation can be found in [34].\",\r\n        \"ANSYS Fluent (Version 16.0) is used simulate the flow through windows and predict pollutant transmission. The governing equations are discretized using the finite-volume method. The discretization for continuity, momentum, energy, turbulence and scalar are all second-order upwind schemes. The pressure staggering option (PRESTO!) scheme is employed for pressure interpolation. The pressure and velocity is coupled using the semi-implicit pressure linked equation (SIMPLE) algorithm. Convergence criteria of 10−5 are used for all variables. Each case is solved using the steady state form of the equations except for the second validation case. When simulating the transient solution, the time step is set to 0.5 s to satisfy the Courant number of unity. The boundary conditions for the building and computational domain are summarized in Table 2\\n. In the building, the no-slip condition is imposed on all solid surfaces. Temperatures are specified for the side walls and floor, while the front wall and ceiling are specified as adiabatic. In the computational domain, temperature and ambient pressure are specified at the topmost plane. No-slip and adiabatic boundary conditions are employed on the ground. As shown in Fig. 1, the left and right sides of the external domain in the z\\n \\n−\\n \\ny planes are symmetric boundaries, which replicate multiple dwellings on a floor. The x\\n \\n−\\n \\ny plane at the computational boundary of the ambient region is specified as a free-slip boundary with different temperatures to represent different ambient conditions.\",\r\n        \"The geometry and mesh were created using Gambit (Version 2.3.16), and hexahedral cells were generated with the ‘submap’ scheme. A grid resolution study was performed using cells with average lengths of 2.5 cm (fine), 5.0 cm (medium) and 10 cm (coarse). Changes in velocity and temperature were examined and it was found that the discretization error for the medium-to-fine was 4.25% using a Richardson extrapolation [39], [40]. Hence, the simulations will use the medium grid for the analysis herein. Further details about the grid resolution can be found in [33].\",\r\n        \"The study begins by validating the CFD predictions with data from two experiments. One experiment is from Jiang and Chen [41], who provided velocity and temperature profiles that we use to demonstrate the accuracy of the CFD model to predict natural ventilation. The other is an experiment by Grabe et al. [42], which provides profiles of tracer gas inside the building with buoyancy-driven ventilation and will validate the CFD model for gaseous pollutant transmission.\",\r\n        \"In the experiment by Jiang and Chen [41], two chambers represented the indoor and outdoor environments, as shown in Fig. 3\\n(a). The buoyancy-driven ventilation was generated through a baseboard heater inside the test chamber and a rectangular window was located opposite to the baseboard heater. The air velocity and temperature at five locations (P1 − P5) inside and outside the test chamber were measured. The experimental data from two positions (P2, P5) in the test chamber were used to validate the CFD model in the study. More details on the experiment can be found in [41]. However, specific experimental uncertainty was not provided so the data will not be represented with error bars. Fig. 3(b) − (e) compare the predictions for velocity and temperature with the measured data at P2 and P5. In general, the velocity and temperature profiles are in good agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the CFD model is able to provide acceptable predictions of thermal flow profiles for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation.\",\r\n        \"In the study by Grabe et al. [42], the experiment consists of a test chamber and an environmental chamber, as shown in Fig. 4\\n(a). The dimensions of the test chamber have a length of 2.5 m, width of 3.5 m and height of 3.2 m. The dimension of the environmental chamber exceeds that of the test chamber, but the specific size of the environmental chamber was not provided. A vertical slide window with a 1.23 m width and 1.48 m height was located on the front wall of the test chamber. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was the tracer gas and was injected into the test chamber with the window closed before measurements were taken. The tracer gases of CO2 and SF6 are the most frequently applied tracer gases in ventilation measurements, which are both colorless gases with densities larger than that of air [43], [44]. The test chamber was heated by an electrical heating unit. Once CO2 concentrations reached 4000 ppm inside the test chamber and the temperature difference between the two chambers was 8 °C, CO2 injection and electrical heating ceased, the window was opened and the measurements began. CO2 concentration in the center of the test chamber at different heights was measured during the buoyancy-driven ventilation.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 4(b)–(e) compare the computed CO2 concentration with the experimental data at different heights at the center of the test chamber. Due to the lack of information of the environmental chamber, two types of boundary conditions were tested with the CFD modeling. One condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was open to ambient conditions and pressure was specified (BC-open). The second condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was a no-slip wall (BC-close). As shown in Fig. 4(b)–(e), the CO2 concentration generally decreases with time during ventilation. Compared to the decay of CO2 at y\\n = 2.8 m, the CO2 concentration at y\\n \\n=\\n 0.4 m decreases faster at the initial stage (t\\n = 0 − 800s). The concentration of CO2 predicted by the CFD model is in good agreement with experimental data at the initial stage. However, the CFD predictions gradually deviate from measurements as the time continues. The CFD predictions suggest that the boundary condition that specified ambient pressure is more similar to the experimental conditions. Although neither boundary condition tested perfectly agrees with the experimental data, and not knowing the exact experimental conditions, the CFD modeling can be considered reliable.\",\r\n        \"As shown in Fig. 4(b)–(e), the discrepancy may be attributed to the specification of the external domain which represents the environmental chamber. When the no-slip boundary (close) is employed at the top of the external domain, the CO2 exhausted from the test chamber cannot be removed from the external domain, increasing the CO2 background concentration. However, the CO2 exhausted from the test chamber can be removed from the external domain over time if the ambient boundary (open) is specified at the top of the external domain, thus maintaining a lower CO2 concentration. Owing to that, the size of external domain highly affects the background concentration of CO2 entering into the test chamber. Unfortunately, the dimension of the environmental chamber was not given in the experiment [42]. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to use the scalar transport equation to predict gaseous pollutant transmission via buoyancy-driven airflow.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 5\\ncompares the predicted velocity, temperature, concentration and mass flow rate profiles for different ambient temperatures; the profiles are taken along a line that runs directly through the center of the room on each floor. Since VSW is one of the most general window types and can produce the largest ventilation rate among the six windows, as discussed in [33], the impacts of the ambient temperature and released pollutant on cross-transmission are presented using the VSW as an example. The VSW configuration is modeled with an open area of 0.8733 m2 and the release rate of the target pollutant (HCHO) is 20 μg/s. The reason of setting the value of the pollutant release rate will be explained in Sect. 3.1. To improve the comparability of numerical results, the parameters are non-dimensionalized as,(8)y*=y/H\\n(9)u*=u/gH\\n(10)T*=(T−T∞)/(Ts−T∞)\\n(11)C*=(C−Cmin)/(Cmax−Cmin)\\n(12)M*=M/(ρWHRoΔT)where y is the vertical coordinate, H is the floor height, W is the building width, ΔT is the indoor-outdoor temperature difference, M is the mass flow rate of air passing through the window, Ro is the air constant, the subscripts s and ∞ denote the surrounding surfaces and ambient environment, respectively, and the subscripts min and max denote the maximum and minimum values, respectively.\",\r\n        \"As illustrated in the pollutant profiles of Fig. 5, the indoor velocity, concentration and mass flow rate generally increase when the ambient temperature decreases, while the indoor temperature shows an opposite variation. The pollutant distribution on the first floor and the two upper floors differ greatly because the pollutant source is located in the center of the first floor room. The concentration around the pollutant source is the largest, and the maximum concentration on each floor appears at the height of air inflow, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The comparison demonstrates that ambient temperature does not produce an obvious impact on the basic characteristics of thermal flow and concentration profiles. To compare the results with our previous research [33] and subsequently determine the best window configuration that minimizes cross-transmission, the ambient temperature is specified as 20 °C in the remainder of the study.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 6\\ncompares the computed concentration profiles with different release rates of the HCHO source for the VSW case (A\\n2\\n = 0.8733 m2, \\nT\\n∞\\n = 20 °C). The average concentration of HCHO inside the building obviously increases with increasing release rate for each floor, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Since the HCHO source is located on the first floor, the average concentration inside shows the most drastic response to the variation of the release rate. According to the threshold for indoor HCHO suggested by WHO (81 ppb), the average concentration in the first floor room is 1.4 − 13.1 times the threshold. As introduced by Guo et al. [4], the HCHO level in new residential buildings after decoration was found to be over 9 times higher than the threshold. Therefore, modeled a pollutant source of 80 μg/s for the VSW case (A\\n2) can best represent the real condition based on the WHO threshold. The average concentrations for the second and the third floor are 62 ppb and 11 ppb in the case of I\\n \\n=\\n 80 μg/s, which are 0.77 and 0.15 times the threshold, respectively. If the release rate of the source pollutant increases slightly, the HCHO concentration in the second floor room may be over the threshold, and the level in the third floor room will become worse as well. Therefore, human beings on the upper floor adjacent to the first floor (with the pollutant source) in the multistory building risk cross-infection during single-sided natural ventilation.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 6(b) presents the dimensionless concentration profiles along a line through the center of the rooms and corresponds to different release rates of the HCHO source. Most notably, the profiles collapse and demonstrate that the trends do not change, irrespective of release rate; only the magnitudes change for the raw data. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the specification of the pollutant release rate will not affect obtaining basic characteristics of gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in the multistory building. Due to that, the release rate of the pollutant source is specified as 20 μg/s for the remainder of the study.\",\r\n        \"As defined by ASHRAE Handbook [45], the air change rate per hour (ACH) compares the airflow rate Q to the volume of the corresponding space​\\n (i.e., ACH = \\nQ/​\\n). As shown in Fig. 7\\n(a) − (c), the ACH for each floor increases with increasing open area for each window type. The ventilation performances of each window type on the first and second floor are very similar, and minor differences are present on the third floor. In general, the VSW and HPW perform best in terms of ventilating the multistory building, followed by the TURN, VPW and TILT. The AW style always performs the worst among the six window types except when the window open area is less than 0.5 m2 on the first floor, and then TILT performs the worst as shown in Fig. 7(a). On the second and third floor of the multistory building, the performance of the TILT is better than that of the AW owing to the upward airflow in front of the facade induced by the plane of the TILT, as shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c). On the first floor of the multistory building, the performances of the TILT and AW are more similar and change with the open area of the window. These findings are consistent to our previous work on ventilation performances of various window types in a one-story building, as shown in Fig. 7(d) [33].\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 8\\npresents the average HCHO concentration for each floor comparing open area. The average HCHO concertation decreases with increasing open area for each window type. Note that the maximum values along the abscissa are different in Fig. 8 because the first floor levels are significantly higher and the third floor levels are significantly lower. However, the pollutant concentrations on a particular floor with different window types show pronounced differences on the second floor, although the open window areas and release rates of HCHO are equal. This can be attributed to the window style that impacts ventilation rates. As shown in Fig. 8, the average concentration of HCHO for the HPW case in each floor is not the smallest among the six window cases. However, the corresponding ventilation rate for the HPW case is still the largest, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, the window configuration affects the pollutant transmission between floors in multistory buildings. The HCHO concentration decays with increasing floor level with the same window type. From the first floor to the second floor to the third floor, the average HCHO concentration can reach magnitudes of 100 − 1000, 10 − 100 and 10, respectively. Clearly, the performance of various windows on preventing airborne pollutant re-entering upper floors are different. Among the six window types, the VPW, TILT and TURN styles generally do not perform well and thus does not adequately restrict the pollutant from re-entering upper floors. In contrast, the VSW and HPW styles perform better but the AW style presents the best performance on restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates.\",\r\n        \"To further illustrate the impact of window configurations on pollutant transmission between floors in the multistory building, Fig. 9\\npresents HCHO distributions at the central x-plane for different window types with the same open area (Ai\\n = 0.8733 m2). As shown in Fig. 9, the HCHO profiles inside and outside the building are sensitive to window styles. By considering the configurations of the VSW and HPW styles, the TURN, VPW and TILT styles present similar characteristics of HCHO distributions because similar transmission paths are created by windows. Among the six windows, the AW style performs the best with low pollutant transmission since the upward airflow is prevented by the window pane. In contrast, the TILT, TURN and VPW styles are not as effective in reducing pollutant cross transmission because the window pane does not redirect the flow. Therefore, the HCHO concentrations in the upper floor rooms for these three window cases are relatively higher. The HCHO concentration reduces by nearly one order of magnitude between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors for each window style, while the reduction between the second floor and the third floor is much less than that between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors.\",\r\n        \"To better understand different window performances on the pollutant transmission between floors, Fig. 10\\npresents thermal flow profiles at the central x-plane for three cases. Among the six window types, the AW style shows the best performance for restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates. The VSW and HPW styles perform adequately, and the VPW, TILT and TURN types perform the worst. Considering the performances of each window and the characteristics of pollutant distribution, only the thermal flow profiles corresponding to VSW, AW and TURN are presented. The velocity streamlines near the windows provide a visual understanding of how the pollutant transports through the openings. The upward flow is obviously restricted by the window pane in the AW case, controlling the exhausted pollutant from re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The TURN style directs the air toward the window opening such that the air exhausted from each floor cascades along the facade and thus enhances the air re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(c). Compared to the TURN case, the air path passing through each floor window is better separated in the VSW case, so the indoor pollutant cross-transmission is reduced as well, as shown in Fig. 10(a). The thermal flow profiles for the VSW provides the best ACH ventilation rates, and the overall mean velocity is higher and the temperature is lower than the other cases. The TURN case performs adequately but the velocity field demonstrates reduced circulation, and thus lower ACH but the temperatures are reasonable.\",\r\n        \"The results presented thus far indicate that possibility of pollutants flowing between adjacent floors. Therefore, the infection risk of a pandemic virus through cross-transmission in multistory buildings with flush windows on the same facade cannot be neglected. To quantify the infection risk caused by cross-transmission, the amount of the air exhausted from the first floor (source) entering upper floors can be determined. As proposed by Niu and Tung [16], the parameter of re-entry ratio that represents the fraction of the exhausted air from the source floor to upper floors can be defined as,(13)ηR=Cave,RQRCave,SRQSRwhere η\\nR is the re-entry ratio, C\\nave is the average pollutant concentration in that floor, Q is the volume flow rate, R is the floor number (1, 2, 3, etc.), and SR is the floor with the source.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 11\\npresents the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air from the source floor entering the upper floors. As shown in Fig. 11, the re-entry ratio for the second floor is generally larger than that for the third floor because of the smaller transmission distance from the pollutant source. In the second floor room, the re-entry ratios for HPW and TURN cases increase progressively with the ACH, while that for the VSW case exhibits a monotonic decrease. In contrast, the re-entry ratios for the TILT and VPW cases fluctuate with ACH, but the re-entry ratio for the AW case remains constant with ACH. Similarly, various window types are not able to present consistent behaviors in re-entry ratios in the third floor room. Notice that the TILT style always presents the largest re-entry ratio among the six windows, which is most likely because the upward airflow is not restricted by the structure of the window itself. Moreover, the window pane is angled toward the indoor environment and induces the pollutant to re-enter. Thus, the window configurations should be carefully considered for cross-transmission, especially in the control of cross-infection of pandemic virus via airborne transmission, as well as acceptable ventilation.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 11.\",\r\n        \"Based on the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air entering the upper floors, the infection risk of a pandemic virus via airborne transmission can be estimated by the Wells-Riley equation [46]. The Wells-Riley model was initially proposed in an epidemiological study on measles outbreak, which was based on the quantum theory of infection. A quantum was defined as the number of airborne pathogens required to infect a person. By considering the intake dose of airborne pathogens in terms of the number of quanta to evaluate the probability of escaping the infection, the Wells-Riley equation is derived as [46], [47], [48],(14)P=1−exp(−nrξt0Q)where P is the infection risk, n is the number of infectors, r is the quantum generation rate, ξ is the breathing rate, Q is the volume flow rate of the space, and t\\n0 is the exposure time. Notice that the Wells-Riley equation was originally applied to evaluate the risk of infection for one room. When it is applied to assess the risk of cross-infection in a multistory building with several rooms, the quantum generation rate for the receptor rooms can be determined based on the re-entry ratio [30], [49]. Therefore, the Wells-Riley equation is rewritten as,(15)PR=1−exp(−nrηRξt0QR)\\n\",\r\n        \"The quantum generation rate r in Equation (15) cannot be directly obtained, which is generally estimated from a specific outbreak case of pandemic virus. The breathing rate ξ and the exposure time t\\n0 can be specified based on the detailed information of infectors. In our study, the parameters n, r, ξ and t\\n0 are specified according to the work by Gao et al. [30]. In their study [30], the infection risk in a high-rise building with single-sided ventilation driven by the combination of wind and buoyancy forces was assessed. To illustrate the differences of the infection risk caused by different forces, the parameters for our present study are n\\n = 1, r\\n = 13 quanta/h, ξ\\n = 0.6 m3/h, t\\n0\\n = 8 h. It is assumed that an infector stands in the center of the first floor room, and the virus transmission is between the source floor and the second floor and between the source floor and the third floor.\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 12\\npresents the relationship of infection risk versus ACH for different floors. As shown in Fig. 12(a), the infection risks for different window configurations are almost identical in the first floor room due to the amount of virus released by the infector. However, the infection risks for window styles on the second and third floors are different from each other. Obviously, the infection risks for TILT, VSW and VPW cases are relatively higher when the ACH is small in the second floor room. With increasing ACH, the differences between window styles gradually decrease, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b). On the third floor, the infection risk for each window style further decreases the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air, as shown in Fig. 12(c).\",\r\n        \"\\nFig. 12(d) presents the infection risk in the case of airborne transmission driven by a combination of buoyancy and wind forces determined by Gao et al. [30]. As shown in Fig. 12(d), the infection risks in the floor room where the infector is located (i.e., source floor) and the receptor room (i.e., upper floor) present similar orders of magnitudes to our study. On the source floor, the infection risk decreases with increasing ACH although ambient wind is considered in Gao et al., which is the same as our findings on the first floor (i.e., source floor). The largest risk of infection is 6.6% on the upper floor when the wind is 2 m/s, which corresponds to the highest re-entry ratio of the exhausted air but does not correspond to the smallest ACH. Therefore, the wind in practical conditions may either reinforce or suppress the pollutant cross-transmission. To represent realistic performances of window configurations on cross-transmission, the incident wind must be carefully considered in future research.\",\r\n        \"A computational study investigated gaseous pollutant transmission through variable window styles between vertical floors in a multistory building with buoyancy-driven, single-sided natural ventilation. Detailed characteristics of airflow and pollutant distributions inside and outside the building were obtained using CFD. It was shown that it was reasonable to combine the RANS model and a scalar transport equation to solve passive pollutant transmission. The CFD predictions were compared with experiments by Jiang and Chen [41] and Grabe et al.

The pollutant concentration reduced one order of magnitude between the source floor and the upper floors for each window style. Furthermore, the pollutant concentration on different floors was not only affected by the ventilation rate but also by the window configuration. Among the six window types, the AW style showed the best performance for restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it was not able to provide larger ventilation rates. The VSW and HPW styles performed adequately and the VPW, TILT and TURN types performed the worst.\",\r\n        \"It was further shown that the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air re-entering the upper floors generally decreased with increasing floor for each window type. The risk of infection was shown to decrease when evaluated using the Wells-Riley model. Coupled with the previous conclusions, the infection risk can also be controlled by ventilation rate and window configuration. Therefore, window configuration and the ventilation rate should be considered together to reduce the risk of infection in practice.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778817318303; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778817318303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288118/\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC3850527\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1186/1471-2458-13-897\",\r\n    title:\r\n      \"Multi-criteria decision analysis as an innovative approach to managing zoonoses: results from a study on Lyme disease in Canada\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2013-09-30\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Cécile.Aenishaenslin\",\r\n      \"Valérie.Hongoh\",\r\n      \"Hassane.Cissé\",\r\n      \"Anne.Hoen\",\r\n      \"Karim.Samoura\",\r\n      \"Pascal.Michel\",\r\n      \"Jean-Philippe.Waaub\",\r\n      \"Denise.Bélanger\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Background\",\r\n          \"Background\",\r\n          \"Background\",\r\n          \"Background\",\r\n          \"Background\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Methods\",\r\n          \"Problem definition and identification of stakeholders (Steps 1 & 2) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Criteria (Steps 3 & 4) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Strategies and interventions (Step 5) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Evaluation of performance parameters (Step 6) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Weighting of criteria (Step 7) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Decision analysis (Step 8 to 10) ::: Results\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Discussion\",\r\n          \"Conclusions\",\r\n          \"Abbreviations\",\r\n          \"Competing interests\",\r\n          \"Authors’ contributions\",\r\n          \"Pre-publication history\",\r\n          \"Pre-publication history\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\",\r\n          \"references\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"Zoonoses, and more generally infectious diseases arising from the interaction of human populations with animals and the environment, are a growing international public health threat that is likely to increase with ongoing globalisation and climate change. Currently, these diseases represent three quarters of all recognized emerging infectious diseases [1]. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza and SARS had expensive and multi-sectoral consequences across continents [2,3]. The worldwide emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and West Nile virus (WNv) in North America are two additional examples of such diseases that have caused widespread concern with the general public and decision makers [4,5].\",\r\n        \"Interacting at the human-animal-environment interface, zoonoses that involve vectors and wildlife species have particular characteristics making them difficult to prevent and control. On the one hand, they involve multiple species, often with complex ecologies, making control or eradication very difficult. On the other hand, because of this ecological complexity, preventive and control interventions of zoonoses can have environmental, social and economic impacts. For example, larvicides used in attempts to control WNv during the 1999–2007 outbreak in Canada were found to be toxic for some wild bird and fish species, and their use was publicly criticized by local media and experts [6]. Moreover, zoonoses pose important prevention and control challenges because multiple organisations and stakeholders share responsibilities with regards to public health actions; however, the implementation and anticipated effects of cross-sectoral interventions can be more difficult to predict for strategic planners and decision-makers. This complexity calls for transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches in order to achieve effective disease management, a call which can no longer be ignored [7].\",\r\n        \"A “One Health” approach is needed to develop effective management for zoonoses. The “One Health” approach recognizes the intimate linkages between human, animal and environmental health systems and proposes an international, interdisciplinary, and cross-sectoral approach to disease surveillance, monitoring, prevention, control and mitigation of emerging and re-emerging diseases [8]. In recent years, this approach has been adopted by several national and international organisations as a promising way to improve public health interventions [9,10].\",\r\n        \"Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods come from the field of operations research and are commonly used in environmental, industrial and business management [11,12]. Multiple MCDA algorithms exist to analyse different types of decision problems, one of which consists of ranking and comparing alternatives based on multiple criteria that can be evaluated using either quantitative and/or qualitative indicators [13]. In the absence of quantitative data for a criterion in a specific context, MCDA methods allow for the incorporation of qualitative evaluations, for example based on expert opinion. Moreover, it offers the possibility, if needed, for a participatory approach with stakeholders concerned by a particular issue, allowing them to actively engage in all stages of the decision analysis supported by MCDA. As such, MCDA methods are well suited for complex, transdisciplinary and multi-sectoral decision-making problems such as zoonotic disease management [14,15]. The use of MCDA in public health has thus far been limited but is emerging as a complementary method for evidence-based public health [16-18]. It has been used in different contexts, such as for the prioritization of general health issues, including zoonoses [17-23], and to compare potential alternatives or interventions for public health management. For this later goal, most published studies have been in the field of environmental health, but some more recent studies were done to prioritize interventions for infectious diseases management [24-26]. Fewer studies have attempted to confront zoonotic or animal related disease problems with an MCDA approach: one such study used MCDA to compare strategies for the elimination of carcasses following a hypothetical event of food-industry targeted terrorism [27], another used MCDA to compare different methods of quarantine and control during animal disease epidemics [28,29]. Hongoh and colleagues [30] proposed a general model and discussed the potential strengths of the use of MCDA methods for vector-borne disease management with explicit spatial considerations.\",\r\n        \"Lyme disease, a zoonosis caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans via the bites of ticks infected from animal reservoirs, is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in temperate countries and is a good example of a public health issue at the human-animal-environment interface [31]. The incidence of Lyme disease has been increasing annually in North America, particularly in the north-eastern United States where more than 20,000 cases are reported annually [31]. In the Canadian province of Quebec, the incidence of Lyme disease has thus far been low (0.5 per 100 000 in 2011 according to a recent report by the Quebec National Institute of Public Health [32] compared to rates of 60.3, 67.3 and 76 per 100 000 in the same year in the neighbouring states of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont respectively [33]), but could grow to 8 000 cases annually by 2050 in the southeast and the central southern parts of Canada [34-37]. The first autochtonous human case of Lyme disease in Quebec was reported in 2008 (Quebec National Institute of Public Health, unpublished observations). Black legged tick populations, the vector of B. burgdorferi, are now recognized as having become established in the southern part of the province, with up to 13% of ticks infected with B. burgdorferi[37]. Given these changing dynamics, the Quebec public health authorities have expressed the desire to proactively respond to this public health concern and to develop a Lyme disease management plan. As such, this is an ideal context for the use of MCDA methods for zoonotic disease management. In the Quebec health system, public health responsibilities, including Lyme disease prevention, are shared between provincial and regional public authorities. The Ministry of Health and Social Services, supported by the National Institute of Public Health in Quebec, is the provincial authority and first level responsible for applying provincial public health programs in collaboration with regional authorities [38]. Each of the 18 administrative regions of the province has their own Health and Social Services Agency. No province-wide program for Lyme disease management currently exists due to the fact that the disease is presently only concentrated in the southern part of Quebec and has affected only a few regions. This article aims to present the context, goals, methods and results from a study of the use of MCDA for Lyme disease management in Quebec, Canada.\",\r\n        \"The study was conducted between September 2010 and February 2012 with the general objective of identifying, evaluating and ranking different strategies for Lyme disease management in Quebec, in order to support decision-making and program direction by public health authorities. A research team composed of senior and junior researchers active in the fields of public health, veterinary public health and decision analysis research was assembled specifically for this study.\",\r\n        \"Three main intervention areas were first identified to address Lyme disease management in a comprehensive manner (see the result section for the detailed research questions): preventive communication strategies (COMM), surveillance strategies (SURV) and control strategies (CONT). Preventive communication strategies refers to all modes of communication implemented by public health authorities to prevent Lyme disease in humans; surveillance strategies refers to vector, animal and human related surveillance activities designed to monitor the disease and the state of the infection in the reservoir and the vector; and control strategies refers to field interventions which can be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission of the infectious agent to humans. This article will focus on the results from the MCDA approach applied to the ranking of surveillance and control strategies. Analyses of communication strategies with MCDA will not be presented in the present paper as they required a slightly different methodological framework. The term ‘intervention’ will be use to refer to the specific strategies included in this study for surveillance and control.\",\r\n        \"The MCDA process used for this study can be divided into ten general steps, each with specific methods (Figure 1). These ten steps are non-linear and may require a few iterations. For example, the identification and inclusion of certain strategies in the model can lead to the inclusion of additional stakeholders in the group as was the case for our project. A participatory approach (focus groups, individual interviews, questionnaires) with a group of stakeholders was adopted for this study. A stakeholder was defined as a person representing an organisation or a group with direct responsibilities or with specific interests in Lyme disease management. This included representatives of governmental or non-governmental organisations, health professionals and experts (different from the research team). Stakeholders were asked to represent the preferences of their organisation and not their own preferences. To make this possible, they were invited to consult other colleagues in their organisation throughout the MCDA process. Stakeholders participated most intensively in the problem definition stage, identification of the extended stakeholders group, identification of key decision issues, translation of these issues into measurable criteria, identification of Lyme disease intervention strategies (steps 1 to 5) and weighting of the criteria (step 7).\",\r\n        \"The identification of issues (step 3), the definition of criteria (step 4) and the selection of interventions (step 5) were done using an iterative process with the stakeholders: the research group proposed a first set of interventions and criteria along with their definitions, indicators for each criteria and appropriate measurement scales based on their understanding of the major surveillance and control issues for Lyme disease. This initial set was discussed and modified by the stakeholders by means of a focus group discussion. The final versions of the criteria (name, definition, indicator, measurement scales) and interventions lists were then validated by each stakeholder using a web-based questionnaire.\",\r\n        \"The evaluation of performance parameters for the retained list of interventions was carried out over each criterion (step 6) using literature supported data when available. When data were not available to evaluate parameters for criteria, Delphi surveys were conducted with stakeholders (CONT model) and external experts (SURV model). If there was no consensus on parameters after two iterations of the Delphi process, the mean value was selected. For the CONT model, selected stakeholders and members of the research team were consulted as experts for the determination of parameters. For the SURV model, a group of three external experts in Lyme surveillance were consulted.\",\r\n        \"Individual weighting of all criteria was done by each stakeholder under two different scenarios (step 7). The first scenario described the current epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Quebec (referred to as “emergence scenario”). The second scenario described a hypothetical substantial increase in the annual number of human cases of Lyme disease in Quebec, coupled with more intensive media coverage and public awareness (referred to as “epidemic scenario”). Each stakeholder was asked to create model-specific weighting schemes based on the stakeholder’s perceived importance of criteria for decision-making in line with their organisational affiliation. This was done by first distributing 100 points among the criteria categories and then re-distributing the category specific points to all criteria within each category. A tool was created using Excel software version 2007 to facilitate this exercise. Individual support was offered to stakeholders to complete the weighting when needed to ensure a good comprehension of the process.\",\r\n        \"Decision analysis (steps 8 to 10) was carried out in D-Sight (software version 3.3.2) which uses the PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) methods and gives access to the GAIA (Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid) visual model to explore analysis results [39-41]. PROMETHEE methods enable fully comparative rankings of a set of alternatives [11]. The decision map, which is called a GAIA plan and is generated by the D-sight software, is a two-dimensional graphical representation of a stakeholder’s position, dictated by their individual preferences (ranking of interventions). The decision map is referenced with a decision axis (in red), which points toward the “best” interventions in accordance with the group scores of interventions on all included criteria. The proximity of stakeholder’s positions within the GAIA plan represents proximity in their overall preferences. This graphical representation of stakeholder values can be used to identify potential coalitions or clusters of positions among stakeholders and to identify positions that are distinctive from that of other stakeholders by their distances in relation to others or to the decision axis. Similarly to positioning stakeholders, the GAIA plan also positions all interventions in relation to the overall decision axis. Multi-criteria analyses carried out in D-sight assess the performance of interventions over all criteria resulting in numerical scores for each intervention. D-sight uses specific algorithms based on a pair wise method of analysis to calculate scores (PROMETHEE I and II) [33]. The intervention scores and weighting schemes set by stakeholders can be combined to produce three sets of results of particular interest in our study: 1) group rankings of the interventions, representing an ordered ranking of most preferred to least preferred intervention that takes all weighting schemes and intervention performance scores into account; 2) individual rankings for each stakeholder, representing the most preferred to least preferred intervention for a particular stakeholder given their specific weighting scheme; and 3) individual performance of interventions for every criterion, showing how an intervention performs on every criterion independently of all stakeholder weighting schemes. Intervention scores represent the relative performance of an intervention with respect to another, and as such scores do not have individual meanings by themselves. The objective of these scores is to provide a common numeric value to enable comparisons of interventions. Further details on MCDA methods have been published by Figueira and colleagues [42].\",\r\n        \"Analyses presented in this paper include group rankings and individual performance of selected interventions, as well as decision maps of stakeholder’s preferences for particular interventions (GAIA planes), and an example of a sensitivity analysis of one stakeholder’s weighting schemes. Each of the 10 MCDA steps was conducted separately for each intervention area (SURV and CONT). Results for the first 5 steps will be presented using SURV and CONT models and a more in depth illustration will be presented for steps 6 to 10 using the CONT model.\",\r\n        \"To address the general problem of identifying, evaluating and ranking different strategies for Lyme disease management in Quebec, five governmental and one academic organisations involved in Lyme disease management were identified and invited to participate in the MCDA process. Eight representative stakeholders agreed to participate. The composition of the group was defined in order to capture the multidisciplinary nature of Lyme management (Table 1). For the examination of surveillance and control strategies, two models were developed to address two specific research questions identified by the stakeholders: 1) what strategies are most effective for Lyme disease surveillance? (SURV model); and 2) what interventions are most effective for the prevention and control of Lyme disease? (CONT model). In the context of this study, effectiveness represents the overall relative performance of strategies and interventions over multiple decision criteria, taking into account their importance as defined by the stakeholders for the Quebec context.\",\r\n        \"Sixteen criteria were selected for the two models to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions relative to the main issues of Lyme surveillance and control (Table 2). These criteria were divided into five general categories: public health criteria (PHC), animal and environmental health criteria (AEC), social impact criteria (SIC), strategic, economic and operational impact criteria (SEC) and surveillance criteria (SUC). Indicators were defined for each criterion and used qualitative scales for measurement. Categorical ordinal scales were used for all criteria, except for AEC1 and AEC2 where a multiplicative indicator was defined.\",\r\n        \"For the SURV model, 11 interventions were identified and consisted of various passive and active surveillance strategies targeting vectors, domestic animals and humans: passive surveillance of vectors found on humans (SURV1a) and animals (SURV1b); active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging (SURV2a), by trapping of small rodents (SURV2b) and from hunted deer (SURV2c); passive surveillance of domestic animals seropositive cases of B. burgdorferi funded by the animal owners (SURV3a), funded by the private sector (industry) (SURV3c) or funded by the public sector (SURV3b); active surveillance of cases of Lyme disease in domestic animals (SURV4); passive surveillance of suspected and confirmed cases of Lyme disease in humans (SURV5); sentinel surveillance of suspected cases in humans (SURV6). For the CONT model, 16 interventions were selected, again with the aim to compare different approaches for Lyme disease prevention and control targeting vectors, vector hosts and human populations. Vector targeted interventions included: small (CONT1a) and large (CONT1b) scale acaricide applications, dessicants/insecticidal soap applications (CONT2), removal of tick habitats by small scale landscaping bordering houses and alleys (CONT3a) or by large scale landscaping in public forested areas (CONT3b). Vector host targeted interventions included: the use of ‘4-poster’ device to control tick infestation on deer (CONT4) or feed-administered ivermectin (CONT5), reduction of deer populations by increased hunting quotas (CONT6a), by culling (CONTb), or by exclusion of deer from public areas (CONT7), tick control on small rodents by ‘Damminix’ device (CONT8) or fipronil application (CONT9). Human population targeted interventions included: exclusion of people from high risk areas (CONT10), vaccination (CONT11), development of Lyme disease clinics to facilitate diagnostic and treatment (CONT12)). All selected CONT interventions have been used in the past to prevent and control Lyme disease in experimental or real life contexts. A ‘status quo’ intervention (CONT0) was also included to represent a ‘no additional measures taken’ option where only a basic public communications strategy for Lyme disease prevention is provided by public health authorities with dissemination via web sites and occasional press releases.\",\r\n        \"Each intervention was evaluated on each of the selected criteria using the defined measurement scales and resulting in the creation of two performance matrices, one for each model (Table 3). Performance parameters on criteria varied depending on the intervention. For example, CONT1b (large scale acaricide application) had the highest parameter value (equal to 48) for criterion AEC1 (impact on habitat), meaning that this intervention would have the highest impact on habitat among all interventions included in the matrix. CONT0 (status quo), CONT11 (vaccination) and CONT12 (development of Lyme disease clinics to facilitate diagnostic and treatment) had the lowest parameter values for criterion AEC1 (equal to 1), meaning that these interventions would have the lowest impact on habitat.\",\r\n        \"The weighting of the retained criteria varied in accordance with stakeholder values in each of the models and varied between both scenarios (Table 4). Public health was the category which generally received the highest weighting. For the CONT model, under the epidemic scenario, five stakeholders (S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7) gave additional weight to the public health criteria at the expense of other categories. For example, stakeholder S4 respectively assigned 30, 25, 25 and 20 points to the public health, animal and environmental impacts, social impacts and strategic, economic and operational criteria categories under the emergence scenario, but assigned weightings of 40, 25, 25 and 10 points under the epidemic scenario for the same categories.\",\r\n        \"Group rankings of interventions were performed for both models using the individual stakeholder’s values expressed via criteria weightings (Table 5). Group scores ranged from −0.34 to 0.45 for the SURV model and from −0.33 to 0.43 for the CONT model. For both models, the three preferred interventions were the same regardless of the epidemiological scenario (emergence or epidemic). For the SURV model, the three preferred interventions were SURV2a (active surveillance of vectors by flagging or dragging), SURV2b (active surveillance of vectors by trapping of small rodents) and SURV1a (passive surveillance of vectors of human origin). For the CONT model, CONT0 (status quo – basic preventive communications), CONT11 (human vaccination) and CONT3a (small scale landscaping) were the three preferred interventions. CONT6b (deer culling) and CONT6a (deer hunting) were classified as the least preferable interventions under both scenarios.\",\r\n        \"The GAIA plan decision map presented in Figure 2 shows the relative position of stakeholders with respect to the decision axis (in red) and selected interventions for the control model (CONT) under the “emergence scenario”. Stakeholder’s positions (represented by S1-8 in this figure) are determined by the combination of the intrinsic performance of interventions and by the stakeholder’s weighting scheme. The closer a stakeholder is to the decision axis (for example S2 and S7 in this map), the more important their agreement with the best consensual interventions (i.e. first ranked interventions), and vice-versa. Interventions located close to the decision axis (CONT0, CONT3a and CONT11 in Figure 2) are the preferred interventions for the group, and correspond to the three best ranked interventions in Table 5. A long decision axis indicates strong decision choice power whereas a short decision axis indicates that the compromise solution is close to the origin [42]. The worst ranked interventions are diametrically opposed to this axis (CONT6b, CONT6a, and CONT8). In Figure 2, all eight stakeholders point toward the right of the x axis, meaning that there are no major discordances in their preferences. Stakeholder 6 and stakeholder 8 are located somewhat apart from the rest of the group’s preferences and had the most different preferences and individual rankings. When examining their individual rankings and intervention scores (Table 6), their top three ranked interventions differ slightly from those of the group ranking even though the top three ranked group interventions are among stakeholder 6 and 8’s four highest ranked interventions (S8 even shares the same top three interventions as the group, but in a different order). This information can be used to help identify the stakeholders with distinct positions relative to the rest of the group, and represents a transparent articulation of decision considerations that need to be further discussed to reach a better consensus.\",\r\n        \"Intervention profiles graphically represent the relative intrinsic performance of an intervention on each criterion, independently of stakeholder expressed preferences (weighting schemes) (Figure 3). A descriptive analysis of the intervention profiles allows for a better understanding of the trade-off to be considered in the overall decision and to identify complementary interventions. The Y axis represents the score of the intervention for each criterion. The first ranked intervention of the group, CONT0 (status quo - basic preventive communications) performs well on animal and environmental health criteria and most operational criteria, but performs poorly on the first two Public health criteria, PHC1 (reduction of human case incidence) and PHC2 (reduction of entomological risk). Conversely, the third ranked intervention, CONT3a (small scale landscaping), performs poorly on the AEC1 criterion (impact on habitat) and SIC2 criterion (proportion of the population benefiting from the intervention), but performs more efficiently on the PHC1 and PHC2 criteria. A score of 1 on a criterion (e.g. Criteria SEC4 (Complexity) and SEC5 (Impact on organisation’s credibility) for CONT0) means that the intervention has the best intrinsic performance for this criterion among all interventions. By examining an intervention’s profile, stakeholders can consider various portfolios of interventions in order to create balanced control programmes capable of addressing multiple objectives.\",\r\n        \"A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of a stakeholder’s weighting preferences on their individual and group rankings. This analysis gives indications of the robustness of the results. Stability intervals can be generated for each stakeholder for all criteria. For example, as shown in Table 7, stakeholder 8 can change the weight given to the SEC2 criteria (cost for the private sector) from 0 to 100% without this change affecting the nature of the stakeholder’s top three ranked interventions. However, any variations in the weight of the “PHC1-Reduction in human cases incidence” criterion beyond the range of 27.5 to 38.2 will result in a change in nature of the top ranked interventions for stakeholder 3 indicating that the results are more sensitive to this later criterion.\",\r\n        \"This study demonstrated the application of a transparent decision analysis method to identify decision criteria and rank interventions for the control of Lyme disease in Quebec as an illustration of its potential for the planning and management of other complex public health issues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of MCDA models to document stakeholder engagement in the prioritization of Lyme disease management interventions, and the first use of such an approach to analyse public health interventions for an emerging zoonosis tackling surveillance and control interventions in a comprehensive manner. One of the key observations resulting from this study pertains to the list of criteria identified for use in the different fields of interventions relating to Lyme disease management. The general criteria categories demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the models and lend support to the use of MCDA methods as concrete applications of a “One Health” approach to zoonoses management. The list of criteria could likely be generalized or adapted for use with other vector-borne and zoonotic disease management problems. As an example, four of the general categories (public health, animal and environmental health, social impacts and strategic, economic and operational impacts) and several criteria identified with a different group of stakeholders for two other MCDA models developed to address communication strategies for Lyme disease in Quebec by the research team were identical to those identified for SURV and CONT models (MCDA-Lyme Consortium, 2012, data not shown). Furthermore, the criteria identified in this study correspond directly to the dimensions which should be integrated when analysing public policies, as identified and recommended by the Canadian National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy. This centre recently published a method for synthesizing knowledge about public policies, integrating six dimensions [43], which can be directly correlated to our list of criteria as shown in Table 8. This observation reinforces the fact that MCDA methods have the potential to improve public health decisions in line with the most recent national recommendations for evaluating public policies.\",\r\n        \"The observed variations in stakeholder’s weighting of criteria was expected and can be explained as a result of differences in values, perspectives, objectives and expertise of the participating stakeholders, which is desirable within a interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach. On the other hand, changing the scenario from “emergence” to “epidemic” was found to have little effect on the results, which was unexpected for the research team. Although some additional weighting was given to the public health criteria by several stakeholders during the epidemic scenario, the changes were not sufficient to produce clear differences in the overall rankings of interventions between scenarios. More weight for public health criteria and social acceptability criteria during the epidemic scenario were expected but not clearly observed in this study. One hypothesis is that the description given of the epidemic scenario was not sufficiently alarming to prompt important differences in stakeholder weighting schemes between scenarios. Further analyses are needed under real epidemic situations to validate these observations and to correlate the findings of the MCDA analysis with actions that would actually be implemented by stakeholders in such situations.\",\r\n        \"In both models, performance evaluations of interventions used qualitative categorical indicators for every criterion. If ordinal scales were better suited for the evaluation of certain criteria, as was the case for the SEC4 (complexity) criterion, numeric scales were used to incorporate more precision for other criteria, such as PHC1 (reduction in human case incidence), SEC1 and SEC2 (costs for the public and the private sectors). Moreover, experts who contributed to the evaluation of certain parameters were also stakeholders on the MCDA process for the CONT model. If this approach can be interesting for the appropriation of the decision-making process by the stakeholders, it could also introduce bias in the evaluation of parameters, as preferences and expertise can vary among them. This reflected the data quality which was available at the time of the study and is the main limit of this study. Lyme disease is emerging in Quebec, and very few field studies have been performed to date. The data quality evaluation performed in the models was useful for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge on public health intervention efficacy and impacts in the Quebec context. For the vast majority of interventions and criteria, expert opinions were the most effective way to obtain the data required to complete the models. More time and resources could be used to counter this weakness: field studies can be realized with the objective of increasing the precision of performance evaluations in models. For example, to assess the social acceptability of different control interventions, a Delphi survey was conducted among the stakeholders. A more representative survey conducted among the target population could increase the precision of this performance measure. Furthermore, additional analysis using the same MCDA model structure in other geographical areas where Lyme disease epidemiology is better characterised would provide an opportunity to validate the present model.\",\r\n        \"The first position occupied by CONT0 (status quo-basic preventive communications) in the group ranking for the CONT model was expected. The current communication method in place involves the diffusion of general information via the public organisation’s web interface. This intervention is a baseline intervention upon which stakeholders should build (but not eliminate) and include additional interventions to improve Lyme management.\",\r\n        \"For the SURV model, the top two ranked interventions were SURV2a (active surveillance of I. scapularis by flagging or dragging) and SURV2b (active surveillance of I. scapularis by trapping of small rodents). Again, this was expected, because these two interventions are considered the gold standard approach for Lyme vector surveillance in Canada at the moment [31]. The rank order of other SURV interventions should be interpreted relative to these gold standards in the group ranking.\",\r\n        \"Despite small differences, the decision map for the CONT model showed a good level of agreement between stakeholders. SURV model revealed similar observations. Even if these results represent only the views of a small group of stakeholders, greater differences could have been expected. For example, from stakeholders working for public environmental organisations, one could have expected stronger preferences for low environmental impact interventions, when compared to public health professionals. This observation demonstrates that public health protection is still a strong commonly held value, despite expertise and sectoral differences between stakeholders. In this study, there were no representatives from the general public or from public interest groups. This was a methodological choice made after discussion with participating stakeholders and in light of the exploratory nature of the objectives. The inclusion of such groups, either as representatives of the general public or of representatives of select interest groups (for example members of the Canadian Lyme disease foundation, CanLyme, or public park users) could help diversify the range of expressed preferences and concerns, an important dimension that should be considered in public health decision making.\",\r\n        \"Analysis of the intervention profiles allowed identification of complementary interventions for all models. The strengths and weaknesses of an intervention can be easily identified with these types of analyses, and highlights the need to include diverse interventions for an efficient prevention programme capable of responding to multiple objectives.\",\r\n        \"Sensitivity analyses conducted were limited to identifying stability intervals for weights given to criteria by each stakeholder. Other types of variation, for example on performance parameters of interventions, have to be simulated manually by changing parameters in the matrix. This was not realised in a systematic manner for this study but would be an interesting further step, particularly on parameters which are not supported by the scientific literature. This could help to identify which would be the more urgent knowledge gaps to tackle to consolidate decision-making in this context. Except for sensitivity analysis, the evaluation of a MCDA model’s validity is rarely mentioned in the scientific literature [44]. A framework for MCDA model validity testing would be of great use for public health research. This framework could include more extensive sensitivity analysis on weights and parameters, as well as a standardised approach to assess how accurately the model captures issues of importance to decision-makers.\",\r\n        \"Building on this study’s experience, the authors believe that MCDA approaches offer a structured and systematic process for identifying gaps in the scientific knowledge relating to important decision issues, and can be of great use to guide research priorities in public health in a context of finite and sometimes scarce resources. Another major advantage of formal decision analysis methods is the long-term utility it can confer to decision-makers. Once the matrix is completed (i.e. criteria, interventions and performances have been identified), stakeholders can re-evaluate their weights on each criteria as the epidemiological situation of the disease changes, and can observe the impacts on intervention prioritization. Used in this manner, MCDA models could be adapted and potentially used with real-time decision-making methods.\",\r\n        \"Some challenges arose during the study. First, depending on the scope and depth of the analysis, the MCDA process can be time-consuming: given the participatory approach used in this study, a significant time commitment was needed for meetings and discussions. Experts recommend a minimum of six months to complete an MCDA process with participative components. However, in this case, two years were needed to put together the research team and complete the study. Public health experts had no experience with MCDA methods, and the learning process demanded time and resources. This is not surprising and prolonged timelines have been observed in other multidisciplinary teams [7]. As such, MCDA approaches may be best suited for strategic public health planning rather than for daily decisions and emergency situations, unless MCDA models are already developed. Creating weighting schemes was also challenging and not intuitive for the majority of stakeholders. Individual support was needed in several cases, and participants needed a good understanding of the MCDA process to perform the weighting. Methods exist to facilitate the weighting process in MCDA approaches, such as the use of card sets to help order criteria before attributing numerical values [45]. We strongly recommend using them to increase the validity of analysis.\",\r\n        \"The participative approach used in identifying key stakeholders, criteria and potential interventions contributed to building a comprehensive structure of the key issues in need of consideration and helped capture the complexity of the health problem. The use of a participatory approach in this study also had an interesting and important consequence: the learning process put stakeholders from different sectors and organisations together and enabled mutual learning about each other’s organisation’s issues and priorities. During this project, stakeholders met between two to five times within the year to complete the process. We believe that this approach reinforces an interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach to public health management, leading to institutional empowerment. These long-term outcomes were previously observed in several examples of participatory approaches in health research [46].\",\r\n        \"This study presented the results of an MCDA approach for the management of a complex public health issue - an emerging zoonosis - using a study of Lyme disease management in Quebec, Canada. Results showed that despite different weighting schemes among stakeholders, both models revealed a good level of agreement with regards to preferred interventions for surveillance and control of Lyme disease. The reliance primarily on expert opinion for development of the performance matrices underscores the need to enhance scientific knowledge on issues of importance for decision-making for Lyme management in Quebec. Overall, explicit decision analysis methods present themselves as an interesting systematic approach for the management of complex public health issues and particularly for emerging infectious diseases arising from human populations interacting with animals and the environment. Future steps should include an assessment of the applicability and usefulness of the proposed models for program-level decision support pertinent to the prevention and control of Lyme disease in Canada. Moreover, building on the outcome of this project, future projects should evaluate the utility of MCDA for structuring a formal decision analysis approach for other complex public health issues (e.g.: prevention of foodborne and waterborne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, influenza, and environmental health issues) as well as within various ongoing processes and prioritization settings targeting effective multi-sectoral engagement. The development of a methodological framework for MCDA model validation would also be of great interest for the public health sector.\",\r\n        \"AEC: Animal and environmental health criteria; COMM: Communication model; CONT: Control model/Control interventions; SOC: Strategic, economic and operational criteria; HSSA: Health and Social Services Agency; MCDA: Multi-criteria decision analysis; PHC: Public health criteria; SIC: Social impact criteria; SUC: Surveillance criteria; SURV: Surveillance model/Surveillance interventions.\",\r\n        \"The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\",\r\n        \"JPW, DB and PM directed the study.

The hybridoma technique introduced by Köhler and Milstein in 1975 [1] has made it possible to obtain pure mAbs in large amounts, greatly enhancing the basic research and potential for their clinical use. Other scientific and technological advances have also enabled the successful translation of mAbs to the clinic. Around the world, at least 570 therapeutic mAbs have been studied in clinical trials by commercial companies [2], and 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and are currently on the market [3], including 30 mAbs for the treatment of cancer (Table 1).\\n\",\r\n        \"The increasing importance of therapeutic mAbs is apparent (Fig. 1), as mAbs have become the predominant treatment modality for various diseases over the past 25 years. During this time, major technological advances have made the discovery and development of mAb therapies quicker and more efficient. Since 2008, 48 new mAbs have been approved, contributing to a total global market of 61 mAbs in clinical use at the end of 2017, according to the US FDA. Strikingly, a total of 18 new antibodies were granted approval by the US FDA from 2018 to 2019 – this number was tallied from information contained on various websites, including the antibody society [3], the database of therapeutic antibodies [4], and company pipelines and press releases. A list of antibody-based drugs approved by the US FDA is shown in Table 1.\\n\",\r\n        \"The first therapeutic mAb, muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3), was approved by the US FDA in 1986 [5] and comprises a murine mAb against T cell-expressed CD3 that functions as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of acute transplant rejection. The marketing end date of muromonab-CD3 is on July 30th, 2011 (Table 1). To overcome problems of decreased immunogenic potential and efficacy, while making possible the therapeutic use of antibodies for an extended duration, researchers developed techniques to transform rodent antibodies into structures more similar to human antibodies, without loss of binding properties. The first chimeric antibody, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antigen-binding fragment (Fab) (abciximab), was approved in 1994 by the US FDA for inhibition of platelet aggregation in cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 1). The drug was developed by combining sequences of the murine variable domain with human constant region domain (Fig. 2b) [6, 7]. Then the first mAb with an oncologic indication, rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 IgG1 approved for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 1997 by US FDA (Fig. 1) [8, 9].\\n\",\r\n        \"One exceptional advance that accelerated the approval of therapeutic mAbs was the generation of humanized antibodies by the complementary-determining region (CDR) grafting technique [10]. In CDR grafting, non-human antibody CDR sequences are transplanted into a human framework sequence in order to maintain target specificity [10] (Fig. 2c). The first humanized mAb approved by the US FDA in 1997 was the anti-IL-2 receptor, daclizumab, for the prevention of transplant rejection (Fig. 1) [11]. The humanization of antibodies made it possible to clinically apply a new class of biologics directed against diseases that require long-term treatment, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases [12].\",\r\n        \"Based on the success of humanized mAbs in the clinic, a key discovery technology to obtain fully human mAbs (Fig. 2d) was developed in 1990 by Sir Gregory P. Winter [10, 13]. This technique was based on phage display, wherein diverse exogenous genes are incorporated into filamentous bacteriophages to compose a library. The library proteins are then presented on the phage surface as fusions with a phage coat protein, allowing the selection of specific binders and affinity characteristics. The phage display technique was first introduced by George P. Smith [14] and comprises a powerful method for the rapid identification of peptides or antibody fragments, such as single chain fragment variable (scFv) or Fab, that bind a variety of target molecules (proteins, cell-surface glycans and receptors) [15] (Fig. 3b). The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018 was awarded to George P. Smith and Sir Gregory P. Winter. George Smith developed phage-displayed peptides, which can be used to evolve new proteins [14]. Gregory P. Winter was able to apply the phage-displayed antibody library to the discovery and isolation of antibodies [13]. Phage display technology has also been used for antibody maturation by site-directed mutagenesis of CDR and affinity selection. Based on these techniques, the first fully human therapeutic antibody, adalimumab (Humira), an anti-tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) human antibody [16], was approved in 2002 by the US FDA for rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 1). Until now, nine human antibody drugs generated by phage display have been approved by the US FDA (Table 5).\\n\",\r\n        \"Transgenic animals represent another technology for obtaining fully human mAbs (Fig. 3c). This technology was introduced in 1994 by the publication of two transgenic mouse lines, the HuMabMouse [35] and the XenoMouse [36]. The lines were genetically modified such that human immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were inserted into the genome, replacing the endogenous Ig genes and making these animals capable of synthesizing fully human antibodies upon immunization [35, 37]. The first human antibody generated in a transgenic mouse to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), panitumumab, was approved by the US FDA in 2006 (Fig. 1) [38, 39]. The number of fully human antibodies made from transgenic mice has increased rapidly, with the number of approved drugs currently at 19 (Table 5). Depending on the immunization protocol, high-affinity human antibodies can be obtained through further selection of hybridoma clones generated from immunized transgenic mice. Using a theoretically similar approach, the generation of neutralizing human antibodies from human B cells has also yielded promising results for infectious disease therapeutics.\",\r\n        \"The recent development of bispecific antibodies offers attractive new opportunities for the design of novel protein therapeutics. A bispecific antibody can be generated by utilizing protein engineering techniques to link two antigen binding domains (such as Fabs or scFvs), allowing a single antibody to simultaneously bind different antigens. Thus, bispecific antibodies may be engineered to exhibit novel functions, which do not exist in mixtures of the two parental antibodies. Most bispecific antibodies are designed to recruit cytotoxic effector cells of the immune system to target pathogenic cells [40]. The first approved bispecific antibody was catumaxomab in Europe in 2009 [41]. Catumaxomab targets CD3 and EpCAM to treat solid tumors in patients with malignant ascites. However, this drug was withdrawn from the market in 2017 for commercial reasons. Currently, two bispecific antibodies have obtained US FDA approval and are on the market. First, blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) that targets CD3 and CD19 for treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [42]. Second, emicizumab is a full-size bispecific IgG with natural architecture, which binds to activated coagulation factors IX and X for the treatment of haemophilia A [43]. To date, there are more than 85 bispecific antibodies in clinical trials, about 86% of which are under evaluation as cancer therapies [40]. The concepts and platforms driving the development of bispecific antibodies continue to advance rapidly, creating many new opportunities to make major therapeutic breakthroughs.\",\r\n        \"While mAbs are routinely used in biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, and medical research, perhaps the most beneficial application is their use as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of human diseases, such as cancer, asthma, arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, transplant rejection, migraine headaches and infectious diseases (Table 1). Important advances in antibody engineering made over the past decade have enhanced the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic antibodies. These developments, along with a greater understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of antibodies, have paved the way for the next generation of new and improved antibody-based drugs for the treatment of human diseases.\",\r\n        \"The mAb market enjoys a healthy pipeline and is expected to grow at an increasing pace, with a current valuation of $115.2 billion in 2018 [44]. Despite this high growth potential, new companies are unlikely to take over large shares of the market, which is currently dominated by seven companies: Genentech (30.8%), Abbvie (20.0%), Johnson & Johnson (13.6%), Bristol-Myers Squibb (6.5%), Merck Sharp & Dohme (5.6%), Novartis (5.5%), Amgen (4.9%), with other companies comprising the remaining 13% [44].\",\r\n        \"Many mAbs products achieved annual sales of over US$3 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1), while six (adalimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab) had sales of more than $6 billion (Table 2). Adalimumab (Humira) had the highest sales figure ever recorded for a biopharmaceutical product, nearly $19.9 billion. The top ten selling mAb products in 2018 are listed in Table 2. Top-selling mAb drugs were ranked based on sales or revenue reported by biological or pharmacological companies in press announcements, conference calls, annual reports or investor materials throughout 2018. For each drug, the name, sponsors, disease indications, and 2018 sales are shown.\\n\",\r\n        \"mAbs are increasingly used for a broad range of targets; oncology, immunology, and hematology remain the most prevalent medical applications [45]. Most mAbs have multiple disease indications and at least one that is cancer-related (lymphoma, myeloma, melanoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck cancers). As such, oncological diseases are the medical specialty most accessible to mAb treatments [45]. Moreover, the number of target proteins known to function as either stimulatory or inhibitory checkpoints of the immune system has dramatically expanded, and numerous antibody therapeutics targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, cemiplimab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab), its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, durvalumab, avelumab, atezolizumab) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, ipilimumab) have been granted marketing approvals [46].\",\r\n        \"Adalimumab (Humira) was the world’s best-selling drug in 2018. Adalimumab is a subcutaneously administered biological disease modifier used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other TNFα-mediated chronic debilitating diseases. It was originally launched by Abbvie in the United States after gaining approval from the US FDA in 2002. It has been shown that Adalimumab reduces the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults, and it is also used to treat psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, uveitis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [47, 48]. It may be used alone or in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [49].\",\r\n        \"Immune checkpoints are important for maintaining self-tolerance and tempering physiologic immune responses in peripheral tissues. Therefore, the molecules underlying checkpoints have recently drawn considerable interest in cancer immunotherapy [50]. Both nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are anti-PD-1 mAbs and were the second and third best-selling mAb drugs in 2018 (Table 2). Nivolumab is a human antibody, which blocks a signal that normally prevents activated T cells from attacking cancer cells. The target for nivolumab is the PD-1 receptor, and the antibody blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated immune inhibition [51, 52]. Pembrolizumab is a humanized antibody used in cancer immunotherapy to treat melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and stomach cancer [53–55]. Pembrolizumab is a first-line treatment for NSCLC if cancer cells overexpresse PD-L1 and have no mutations in EGFR or in anaplastic lymphoma kinase [56, 57]. Large randomized clinical trials indicated that NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab and pembrolizumab (both approved by the US FDA in 2014) showed increased overall survival compared with docetaxel, the standard second-line treatment [58].\",\r\n        \"A total of 12 new mAbs were approved in the US during 2018. The majority of these products were approved for non-cancer indications, perhaps reflecting the higher approval success rate for antibodies as treatments for other diseases. Three antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremaezumab) were approved for migraine prevention, and one (Ibalizumab) is used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The three migraine-preventing drugs, Erenumab (Aimovig), galcanezumab (Emgality), and fremaezumab (Ajovy), are mAbs that block the activity of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor in migraine etiology [59]. CGRP acts through a heteromeric receptor, which is composed of a G protein-coupled receptor(calcitonin receptor-like receptor: CALCRL) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) [60, 61]. Both galcanezumab and fremaezumab bind to CGRP and block its binding to the receptor. However, erenumab is the only one of the three antibodies to target the extracellular domains of human G protein-coupled receptors CALCRL and RAMP1,interfering with the CGRP binding pocket [62].\",\r\n        \"Many mAbs are under development for treatment of infectious diseases, currently only four have been approved by the US FDA: raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab for treatment of inhalational anthrax [63], palivizumab for prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in high-risk infants [64], and ibalizumab for treatment of HIV infection patients [65]. Ibalizumab (Trogarzo) is a humanized IgG4 mAb that is used as a CD4 domain 2-directed post-attachment HIV-1 inhibitor. The US FDA approved ibalizumab for adult patients infected with HIV who were previously treated and are resistant to currently available therapies.\",\r\n        \"Companies are currently sponsoring clinical studies for more than 570 mAbs. Of these, approximately 90% are early-stage studies designed to assess safety (Phase I) or safety and preliminary efficacy (Phase I/II or Phase II) in patient populations. Most of the mAbs in Phase I (~ 70%) are for cancer treatment, and the proportions of mAbs intended to treat cancer are similar for those currently in Phase II and late-stage clinical studies (pivotal Phase II, Phase II/III or Phase III) [2].\",\r\n        \"Twenty-nine novel antibody therapeutics were in late-stage clinical studies for non-cancer indications in 2018. Among the trials for these mAbs, no single therapeutic area predominated, but 40% were for immune-mediated disorders, which comprised the largest group. From this group of potential treatments, leronlimab and brolucizumab entered regulatory review by the end of 2018, and five mAbs (eptinezumab, teprotumumab, crizanlizumab, satralizumab, and tanezumab) may enter regulatory review in 2019. In comparison, there were 33 novel antibody therapeutics in late-stage clinical studies for cancer indications in 2018. Antibody therapeutics for solid tumors clearly predominated, with less than 20% of the candidates intended solely for hematological malignancies. Five mAbs (isatuximab, spartalizumab, tafasitamab, dostarlimab, and ublituximab) license applications were submitted to the US FDA in 2019 [2].\",\r\n        \"Isatuximab is an anti-CD38 IgG1 chimeric mAb under evaluation as a treatment for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Combinations of isatuximab and different chemotherapies are being tested in three Phase III studies (ICARIA, IKEMA, and IMROZ) on MM patients. The ICARIA study (NCT02990338) is evaluating the effects of isatuximab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone compared to chemotherapy only in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. Pivotal Phase III ICARIA-MM trial results demonstrated that isatuximab combination therapy showed statistically significant improvements compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or refractory MM in 2019. The US FDA has accepted for review the biologics license application for isatuximab for the treatment relapsed or refractory MM patients. The target action date for the FDA decision is April 2020 [66]. The IKEMA (NCT03275285) and IMROZ (NCT03319667) studies are evaluating the isatuximab with other chemotherapeautic combinations in MM patients [67].\",\r\n        \"Spartalizumab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds PD-1 with sub-nanomolar affinity and blocks its interaction with PD-L1/PD-L2, preventing PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling and leading to T-cell activation. Clinical study of Spartalizumab is underway with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III COMBI-i study (NCT02967692), which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination with spartalizumab compared to matching placebo in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The primary endpoints of the study are an assessment of dose-limiting toxicities, changes in PD-L1 levels and CD8+ cells in the tumor microenvironment, and progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints are overall survival, overall response rate and duration of response. The estimated primary completion date of the study is September 2019 [68].\",\r\n        \"Dostarlimab is an anti-PD-1 mAb that may be useful as a treatment for several types of cancers. GlaxoSmithKline announced results from a Phase I dose escalation and cohort expansion study (GARNET; NCT02715284) in 2018, which is expected to support a biologics license application submission to the US FDA in 2019. Dostarlimab is being assessed in patients with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options in the GARNET study. The drug is administered at a dose of 500 mg every 3 weeks for the first 4 cycles, and 1000 mg every 6 weeks thereafter in four patient cohorts: microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) endometrial cancer, MSI-H non-endometrial cancer, microsatellite-stable endometrial cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Dostarlimab is also being evaluated in another Phase III study (NCT03602859), which is comparing platinum-based therapy with dostarlimab and niraparib versus standard of care platinum-based therapy as first-line treatment of Stage III or IV non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer [69].\",\r\n        \"Ublituximab is a glyco-engineered anti-CD20 antibody currently under clinical investigation in five late-stage clinical studies for different cancers (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and non-cancer (multiple sclerosis) indications. Three Phase III studies are exploring the efficacy of ublituximab in combination with other anti-cancer agents. Among these studies, the UNITY-CLL Phase III study (NCT02612311) is evaluating the combination of ublituximab and TGR-1202, a PI3K delta inhibitor, compared to anti-CD20 obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in untreated and previously treated CLL patients. Two other Phase III studies (ULTIMATE 1, NCT03277261 and ULTIMATE 2, NCT03277248) are evaluating the efficacy and safety of ublituximab compared to teriflunomide in 440 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis [70].\",\r\n        \"Humanized mAbs, of which only the CDRs of the light and heavy chains are murine, entered clinical development for the first time in 1988 [71, 72]. CDR grafting is one of the most popular techniques in the production of humanized mAbs and was originally developed by Gregory P. Winter in 1986 [9]. Using this technology, non-human CDR sequences are transplanted into human framework sequences, allowing the antibody to maintain the binding activity to the target antigen [9]. The first US FDA approved CDR-grafted humanized mAb occurred in 1997 for daclizumab, which binds the IL-2 receptor and is used to prevent transplant rejection [11]. Queen and collaborators [73] developed daclizumab not only using CDR grafting, but also using the human framework that is maximally homologous to the murine framework, in order to decrease the loss of antigen recognition. In some cases, certain amino acids in the murine framework are crucial to maintain antibody binding activity. These residues may cooperate with CDRs to present an antibody paratope or directly interact with antigens. Currently, these crucial framework residues can be identified by observing the structure of antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and computer-aided protein homology modelling [74]. The positions of amino acids in the framework may then be considered for restore by ‘human back to mouse’ mutations in CDR-grafted humanized antibodies, thereby improving the affinity and stability of the final product. Currently, web servers are being developed by integrated bioinformatics and antibody structure databases for rendering humanization experiments [75, 76]. They provide the tools for human template selection, grafting, back-mutation evaluation, and antibody modeling. However, if the binding activity of antibodies is still compromised, it should be further performed affinity maturation to improve this situation.\",\r\n        \"Multiple methods have been developed to quantify the humanness of the variable region of mAbs. Abhinandan and Martin designed a tool called “H-score” to assess the “degree of humanness” of antibody sequences, which calculates the mean sequence identity compared to a subset of human variable region sequences database [77]. A germinality index was defined subsequent to assist germline humanization of a macaque antibody [78]. G-score was derived from the H-score to improve classification of germline framework sequence [79]. T20 score analyzer was established under a large database of ~ 38,700 human antibody variable region sequences to clearly separate human sequences from mouse sequences and many other species as well [80]. It was used to reveal similarities between humanized antibodies and fully human antibodies. These humanness score tools are available online and allow assisting the generation of humanized antibody [80].\",\r\n        \"The use of humanized antibodies has helped greatly to improve clinical tolerance of mAb therapeutics. Such intricate control over antibody sequences has opened the door to engineering mAbs for a wide range of possible applications in medicine. Currently, half of all mAbs used to treat humans are chimeric or humanized (Fig. 2, Table 1). One of the most well-known humanized antibodies is Trastuzumab (Herceptin), which was approved in 1998 and achieved annual sales of over $7 billion in 2018 (Table 2). Trastuzumab is used for the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [57, 58].\",\r\n        \"The use of mAbs in a clinical setting should have several essential biophysical properties, including high antigen binding activity, high stability, and low immunogenicity [81]. Antibody immunogenicity means the degree of the host immune system can recognize and react to these therapeutic agents. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) induced by the immune system can be found while immunogenicity occurring in patients administered with antibody drugs. Anti-drug antibodies have the potential to neutralize therapeutic agents, which can reduce the efficacy of the drugs [82]. Importantly, anti-drug antibodies may further cause adverse effects ranging from skin rashes to systemic inflammatory responses in the patients, which can impact both safety and efficacy of the antibody drugs in clinic use [83]. Immunogenicity is influenced by several factors, such as drug dosage, administration strategy (route and combination), impurities contamination, aggregates arising from Ab/Ag binding complex, and structural features (sequence variation and glycosylation) [84].\",\r\n        \"Humanized antibodies harbor human sequence in constant regions and nearly all human sequence in Fv, of which only CDRs are murine grafted. Antibodies of more human-like usually allow them to be higher tolerant and lower immunogenic in a clinical setting. For example, Perpetua et al. showed a case to support this concept [85]. They compared a humanized anti-CD52 antibody with its parental murine version and demonstrated humanization offers a significant reduction in immunogenicity. However, humanized antibodies retain murine CDRs which could be regarded as foreign antigens by host immune systems and eventually arise immunogenicity. For example, ADA was detected in 0.5% of women with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated with Trastuzumab during their therapeutic courses [86]. Recently, an immunogenicity analysis result from clinical data showed the ADA rates were 7.1% (21/296) in the HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with treatment of Trastuzumab [87]. The variation of immunogenicity in the same antibody drug may be caused by many potential factors: the age, race, genetic background, other related diseases, and programs of drugs administration.\",\r\n        \"The CDRs and frameworks of fully human antibodies are derived for human immunoglobulin gene repertoires, thus which can theoretically bypass immunogenicity. However, several fully human antibodies have been reported to induce marked immune responses when administrated in patients [88]. Adalimumab (Humira), a human IgG1, has been reported to generate significant immune responses through eliciting anti-idiotypic antibody in a part of patients (5–89%) which varies depending on the disease and the therapy [89, 90]. Golimumab (Simponi), a fully human anti-TNFα antibody, combining with methotrexate for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis cause 16% of patients producing anti-drug antibodies [91]. One reason of these scenarios is that Fv sequence of human antibodies is not identical to human germline: antibody evolution through VJ and VDJ random recombination, as well as affinity maturation naturally occurring in vivo through somatic hypermutation. Until now, there are no in vitro or in-silico assays can precisely analyze the immunogenicity of antibody. In vivo assessments are usually used to evaluate the immunogenicity, of which the result will ameliorate design and engineering of antibody therapeutics to reduce the potential for inducing anti-drug antibodies.\",\r\n        \"Phage display is the first and still the most widely used technology for in vitro antibody selection. The strategy was developed based on the excellent work of George P. Smith in 1985 [14], who used recombinant DNA techniques to fuse foreign peptides with a coat protein (pIII) of bacteriophage M13 in order to display peptides on the bacteriophage surface. He then created “antibody-selectable phage vectors” and described an in vitro method that enabled affinity selection of antigen-specific phage-displayed antibodies from 108-fold excess phage pools [92]. It was later discovered that scFv, small antibody formats, can be expressed on phage filaments. At the time, there were three different research institutions independently establishing phage-displayed scFv or Fab antibody libraries: the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the UK [13, 93, 94], the German Cancer Research Center in Germany [95], and Scripps Research Institute in the USA [96]. Since then, these phage-displayed antibody libraries have proven to be a reliable discovery platform for the identification of potent, fully human mAbs [97].\",\r\n        \"The process of identifying mAbs from a phage-displayed library begins with antibody-library construction (Fig. 4a). The variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, representing the Ig gene-encoding repertoire, are ligated into a phage display vector (phagemid). High quality mRNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The different VH and VL chain-region gene families are then amplified using specific primers to amplify all transcribed variable regions within the Ig repertoire [98, 99]. The format of antibodies in a phage-displayed library can be either scFv or Fab fragments (Fig. 4b); scFvs are composed of the VH and VL domain connected by a short flexible linker. Antibody Fab fragments displayed on the phage coat protein have comparably higher structural stability and can be readily converted to intact IgG antibodies, usually without impairing binding activity [100, 101]. The elegance of phage-displayed libraries is apparent in the linkage between antibody phenotype (specificity and sensitivity) and genotype (genetic information) via the phage particle. Due to the small size and high solubility (1013 particles/ml) of phage particles, repertoire sizes up to 1011 independent clones can be efficiently produced and displayed in a single library [102–104].\\n\",\r\n        \"Gene repertoires for phage display libraries can be obtained from naïve or immunized animals, or the libraries may be synthetically constructed using randomized CDR sequences within fixed frameworks. Phage display naïve antibody libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes of IgM repertoires. Because the gene sequences are derived from B cells of human donors, the naïve libraries are relatively close to the human antibody germ line and have a low risk of immunogenicity. The main advantage of an immunized library over a naïve library is that antibody genes in the immunized library have undergone natural affinity maturation in vivo, allowing the development of high-affinity antibodies against the target. However, this approach requires that immunogenic response can be successfully induced by the antigen of interest, and new libraries must be prepared for each new target. Single large naïve [94, 104, 105] and synthetic [102, 106, 107] libraries have yielded high affinity antibodies (sub-nanomolar range) against a wide spectrum of targets. Therefore, such non-immunized libraries have the distinct advantages of avoiding issues with immunological tolerance in immunized mice, and they do not require new immunized libraries for each new target.\",\r\n        \"Currently, almost all widely accessible commercial libraries are based on highly diverse non-immunized gene repertoires, which allow selection of antibodies against a virtually unlimited number of targets [108]. It is worth noting that most antibody drugs that have undergone evaluation in clinical trials originated from a few company-owned libraries. These libraries include: Cambridge Antibody Technology’s (now MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca) scFv-fragment library, Dyax Corp’s (now Shire) human Fab-fragment libraries, scFv and Fab libraries from XOMA, and the fully synthetic human combinatorial antibody scFv (HuCAL) and Fab (HuCALGold) libraries developed by MorphoSys [97].\",\r\n        \"Antibody libraries are typically screened by iterative selection cycles to enrich target-binding phages, followed by amplification of the bound phages in E. coli cells. The affinity screening process for antibody libraries is called biopanning (Fig. 4c). Repeated rounds of selection allow for the enrichment of very rare antigen-binding phage clones, eventually resulting in the selection of the most highly specific binders. This stringent process is a critical feature of phage display that allows mAbs to be isolated in a period as short as a couple of weeks, far more quickly than the traditional hybridoma method [99, 109]. For in vitro selection, it is necessary to immobilize target antigens on a solid surface. Polystyrene surfaces with high protein binding capacity, such as 96-well immuno-plates and immuno-tubes, are widely used for antigen immobilization. Additionally, magnetic beads with protein G/A, streptavidin, maleimide or N-hydroxysuccinimide can be used to immobilize antigens and perform biopanning in solution.\",\r\n        \"The biopanning method is not only restricted to known recombinant proteins. In fact, the phage display technique may also be utilized to select antibodies against whole cells, unveiling previously unknown antigens on the tumor cell surface [110]. Cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease, and only a few tumor cells with stem-like properties are able to initiate and sustain tumor development; these cells are often referred as tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) [111]. Phage display technology is well suited for applications in CSC research, and several antibodies have already been identified from phage display libraries for their ability to bind known CSC markers, such as CD133 and CD44 [112, 113]. Moreover, novel CSC surface markers may be identified by selecting phage-displayed antibodies that bind to a CSC-like population and then identifying the corresponding target antigens [114, 115]. The use of tumor biopsy tissue as a biological material allows researchers to probe the tumor microenvironment, which may be highly relevant for clinical use. Phage display technology has been used to probe cancer tissue biopsies in order to generate antibody fragments that specifically recognize tumor subpopulations, such as CSCs and tumor-associated endothelial cells [116–118] as well as other clinically relevant tumor antigens [119].\",\r\n        \"Antibodies or antibody fragments have been referred to as targeted drug delivery “missiles” for their ability to direct homing of drugs to tumors [120]. For example, immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to provide conventional liposomal drugs with cancer targeting ability, which can increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs [121]. Cellular internalization of the targeting ligand is an essential outcome for successful tumor-targeted liposomal drug delivery [99, 122]. For this reason, an efficient phage display-based selection approach was designed to map tumor internalizing epitopes, wherein a phage-displayed library was incubated with living cancer cells at 37 °C [123]. This method was successfully applied to rapidly identify several scFvs with high rates of internalization in several types of tumors; the target antigens were subsequently identified, and intracellular drug delivery systems were further developed [99, 124].\",\r\n        \"The identification of mAbs with phage display is an entirely in vitro process. Thus, it is not restricted by immunological tolerance, allowing for the identification of antibodies against poorly immunogenic antigens or those that are difficult to obtain using animal immunization methods (e.g., glycans or toxic agents). The in vitro nature of the assay can be especially useful when identifying specific antibodies against novel or gene-mutated pathogens in an outbreak of emergent infectious diseases [125–127]. The antigens on pathogens usually induce a strong immune response in patients, making it common for infected individuals to naturally produce high-affinity antibodies [128]. To obtain these antibodies, mRNA from the PBMCs of pathogen-infected people can be quickly collected and used as a gene repertoire for a phage-displayed library [129]. Such a library can allow for the rapid identification of high-affinity antibodies that may then be used as guides for vaccine design, or to develop therapeutic drugs and diagnostic reagents.\",\r\n        \"Moreover, the biopanning approach has been modified to isolate and identify a few antibodies with broad neutralizing activity against pandemic influenza virus [130, 131]. Chen et al. reported the establishment of a phage-displayed Fab library derived from the PBMCs of convalescent patients infected with a novel influenza A virus H7N9, which broke out in 2013. Using this library, antibodies targeting purified H7N9 virions were isolated [132]. Two human antibodies were found to exhibit high neutralizing activity against live H7N9 virus due to their interactions with the receptor-binding site of viral hemagglutinin antigens [132, 133].\",\r\n        \"The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) induces a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like disease with an approximately 43% mortality rate [134]. To date, no vaccines or antiviral medications are available for the prevention or clinical treatment of MERS. A large phage-displayed human naive scFv library (Mehta I/II) with 2.7 × 1010 clones from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute was used as a resource for the isolation of human antibodies against MERS-CoV [135]. In another project, a research group in Malaysia improved panning strategies with a naïve human scFv library (library size of 109) to successfully identify mAbs specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein [136].\",\r\n        \"Studies such as those described offer insights into the human antibody response to viral pathogen infection and provide examples of how the outbreak scene may be utilized to develop human antibody-based immunotherapies for the prevention and early treatment of viral pathogens [137].\",\r\n        \"Fully human therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use were discovered from either phage display or transgenic mice approaches [138]. Phage display has the advantage of allowing researchers to tailor critical characteristics of successful antibody drugs (e.g., affinity, specificity, cross-reactivity and stability). There are nine phage display-derived human antibodies currently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of human disease (Table 1), demonstrating the reliability of this technique as a platform for antibody discovery.\",\r\n        \"Adalimumab (Humira) was developed by BASF Bioresearch Corporation and Cambridge Antibody Technology. It was not only the first phage display-derived antibody granted a marketing approval, but adalimubab was also the first approved (2002) fully human mAb drug [139]. Adalimumab binds and suppresses TNFα and is approved to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis. Adalimumab is the world’s best-selling drug [140] with sales of $19.9 billion in 2018 reported by AbbVie (Table 2). Cambridge Antibody Technology also identified human antibodies targeting BLYS (B lymphocyte stimulator) from phage display [141]. BLYS, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily of cytokines, induces B cell proliferation and differentiation that positively correlate with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This anti-BLYS antibody was named belimumab and marketed as Benlysta by GlaxoSmithKline, becoming the first drug approved (2011) for the treatment of SLE [142]. Founded in 1989, Cambridge Antibody Technology was acquired by AstraZeneca for $1.32 billion in 2006 [143].\",\r\n        \"Tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, with higher expression and activation in tumors than in normal tissues. These characteristics make the receptors potentially valuable targets for drug development. Necitumumab (Portrazza) is an anti-EGFR human antibody that was identified by screening high EGFR-expressing epidermal carcinoma cells (A431) with a non-immunized phage Fab library of 3.7 × 1010 clones [105]. Necitumumab was approved in 2015 and is now a first-line therapy in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of squamous NSCLC [144]. VEGFR2 is not only highly expressed in tumor endothelial cells, where it regulates tumor angiogenesis, but it also expressed on the surface of cancer cells. The anti-VEGFR2 human antibody, ramucirumab (Cyramza), was approved for the treatment of gastric cancer, metastatic NSCLC and metastatic colorectal cancer [145, 146]. The development of ramucirumab was initiated by using a phage-displayed human naïve Fab library (Dyax) containing 3.7 × 1010 independent clones for biopanning against the extracellular domain of human VEGFR2 protein [105]. Three Fab clones, D2C6, D2H2, and D1H4, were selected based on their specific binding to VEGFR2 with nanomolar affinity and their ability to neutralize VEGF-A-activated VEGFR2 signaling. Interestingly, these three Fab clones do not cross-react with murine VEGFR2 and share an identical VH sequence [147]. After affinity maturation with stringent biopanning rounds, Fab clone 1121 (IMC-1121B) was selected and showed more than the 30-fold improvement of VEGFR2-binding activity. This clone was subsequently engineered into the human intact IgG1 version (ramucirumab), which has an affinity of 50 pM [148].\",\r\n        \"PD-L1, a cell-surface protein, binds to its receptor PD-1 on immune cells, downregulating T cell inflammatory activity to promote self-tolerance by the immune system. Many types of tumors have been found to express PD-L1 on the surface of cancer cells, using the immune-suppressing action to evade immune attacks. Avelumab (Bavencio) is fully human IgG1 lamda antibody against PD-L1, which was derived from a phage-displayed naïve Fab library (Dyax) [149]. Avelumab not only blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1, but it also induces ADCC in cancers [150]. The later function differs from other immune checkpoint-blocking antibodies. The US FDA approved avelumab in 2017 for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma and Merkel-cell carcinoma, an aggressive type of skin cancer [151].\",\r\n        \"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes skin cell overproduction and is characterized by raised, inflamed, red lesions and plaques that are accompanied by physical pain and itching. Guselkumab (Tremfya) is a fully human antibody developed by Janssen that neutralizes anti-IL-23. The HuCAL antibody library was used to generate guselkumab under a license from MorphoSys [152, 153]. In 2017, guselkumab was granted marketing approval by the US FDA for the treatment of plaque psoriasis [154].\",\r\n        \"Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease that results in spontaneous, recurrent, and potentially life-threatening attacks of swelling in various parts of the body [155]. The disease is commonly associated with deficiency or dysfunction of C1-esterase-inhibitor and with excessive bradykinin production caused by overactive plasma kallikrein [156]. Lanadelumab (Takhzyro) is a fully human mAb derived from the Dyax phage library; it directly binds the active site of plasma kallikrein to inhibit bradykinin production. Lanadelumab was approved in 2018 in the USA and Canada for prophylaxis against attacks of hereditary angioedema in patients aged ≥ 12 years [157].\",\r\n        \"The success of a drug development effort is highly dependent on obtaining patent protection for products and technologies while avoiding infringement on patents issued to others. Therefore, intellectual property rights for phage-display antibody discovery platforms comprise a changing landscape that greatly affects drug development. Currently (2019), almost all of the key patents regarding phage display technologies have expired, including the Breitling/Dübel (EP0440147) and McCafferty/Winter (EP0774511, EP0589877) patents that expired in 2011 in Europe [149]. The US patents covering Dyax and Cambridge Antibody Technology phage antibody libraries have also reached the end of their 20-year protection period (Table 3). The expiration of these patents will allow more companies to create phage display human antibody libraries, advancing the march of therapeutic antibodies into the clinic. The lifting of intellectual property constraints will also spur academic institutions to translate developed phage-displayed antibodies into the clinic.\\n\",\r\n        \"Many researchers have begun to take advantage of these free technologies. For example, Wayne Maraso and colleagues at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Harvard University have constructed two phage display libraries containing 12 billion (Mehta I) and 15 billion (Mehta II) human naïve scFv antibody phages. These libraries have been used to identify numerous human scFv antibodies against a variety of targets [158, 159]. James Marks’ group has also established a phage-displayed human scFv library containing 6.7 billion members at the University of California, San Francisco [98]. This library has yielded a panel of specific antibodies for membrane proteins and living tissues with sub-nanomolar affinity [98, 160, 161]. We have also established a phage-displayed human naive scFv library at the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology (ICOB) in Academia Sinica in Taiwan. The antibody gene repertoires of the ICOB phage antibody library were isolated from the PBMCs of 50 healthy human donors, producing a library size of 60 billion individual scFv clones. This collection has been successfully used to select antibodies that bind a wide spectrum of target antigens, including pure recombinant proteins, glycans, cancer cells and virus particles [99, 103, 104].\",\r\n        \"The idea of producing human antibodies in transgenic mice was first suggested in 1985 when Alt et al. [166] proposed introducing human antibody genes into the mouse germline. This idea was unprecedented and provided a new direction for the development of human antibody production. In 1989, Brüggemann et al. [167] cloned the first human heavy chain construct, containing two human VH genes, for diversity segments (D) linked to the human heavy chain joining cluster (JH), and the μ constant region. The 25 kb construct was micro-injected as a mililocus plasmid into fertilized murine eggs, allowing its random insertion into the murine genome. About 4% of B lymphocytes expressed human μ chain at detectable levels in these transgenic mice. In addition, hybridomas of human IgM antibody could also be established using this transgenic strain. In 1992, Taylor et al. cloned the human κ light chain [168] construct, containing one human kappa light chain variable (Vκ) gene, the human kappa light chain joining cluster (Jκ) and kappa constant region (Cκ). While the mice expressed the human heavy chain (VH-D-JH-Cμ-Cγ1) and the human kappa light chain, the amount of human antibody was less than 10% of total antibodies, so the expression of human antibodies was not compatible with expression of mouse endogenous Ig [168].\",\r\n        \"At a similar time, various murine Ig knockout mouse strains were generated. In 1993, Chen et al. knocked out murine JH and Jκ genes with gene targeted deletion, inactivating mouse Ig [169, 170]. The human IgH and IgL transgenic mice were then crossed with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice in an attempt to create lines that could generate more diverse human antibodies. In 1994, the first human Ig -transgenic mice strain, HuMabMouse [35], was generated by Longberg et al. In this line, human IgH and IgΚ are expressed in murine IgH and IgΚ deficient mice. The entire human IgH genome is about 1.29 Mb and IgΚ is about 1.39 Mb, but the human Ig genome introduced into mice was less than 80 kb [35]. Since antibody diversity comes from germline V(D) J genes, it is reasonable that the introduction of more human variable genes will lead to more diversity of generated antibodies.\",\r\n        \"Likewise, Davies et al. [171] and Choi et al. [172] used yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors in 1993 to respectively construct human IgΚ (~ 300 kb) and IgH (~ 85 kb) genes via yeast homologous recombination. In 1994, Green et al. [37] constructed human IgΚ (~ 170 kb) and IgH (~ 220 kb) genome YACs and successfully introduced them into mouse embryonic stem cells by yeast spheroplast-ES cell fusion. Furthermore, in 1997, Mendez et al. [36] introduced a larger human IgΚ (~ 700 Kb) or IgH (~ 1 Mb) YAC into mouse ES cells, crossing the human Ig mice with murine IgH and IgL knockout mice to generate XenoMouse [131]. As expected, the XenoMouse only express human antibodies rather than mouse antibodies [173]. While the development of this line has eliminated the interference from mouse endogenous Ig and expanded the human Ig genes, the efficiency of human antibody generation, Ig class-switching and somatic hypermutation still remain low, due to a lack of mouse constant region gene expression [158].\",\r\n        \"In order to overcome the drawbacks of a fully human heavy chain antibody, it is necessary to retain the original murine constant region. If a chimeric antibody with human Fab and murine Fc can be generated in mouse, the murine Fc would modulate the signaling for somatic hypermutation during antibody affinity maturation [158, 174, 175] and effector function of antibodies [174, 176]. Along these lines, Osborn et al. [163] linked human VH, D, and JH genes to the rat constant region locus in 2013. The large segments of human IgH and IgL were subcloned and linked by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and YAC techniques, followed by micro-injection of the minilocus plasmid into fertilized rat oocytes. Meanwhile, endogenous rat Ig loci were silenced with a zinc finger nuclease. The resulting rat strain (OmniRat) chimeric human exhibits antibody production, antigen affinity and somatic mutations similar to wild-type rats. In 2014, Lee et al. [164] utilized BACs with Cre/loxP recombination in mouse ES cells to generate a mouse strain with human VH-D-JH and Vκ-Jκ inserted directly upstream of murine Cμ and Cκ regions (KyMouse). After antigen immunization, the KyMouse can process somatic hypermutation and produce high-affinity chimeric human antibodies. In another effort, Murphy et al. [165] used BACs to assemble large human Ig genes and serially micro-injected the constructs into mouse ES cells. The human IgH and IgL genes targeted and replaced the murine IgH and IgL, upstream of the constant region (VelocImmune mouse).\",\r\n        \"Generation of human antibodies by transgenic animals has been accomplished by seven companies: Abgenix, XenoMouse (purchased by Amgen in 2005); Medarex, HuMAbMouse (purchased by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2009); Ligand, OmniRat; Kymab, KyMouse; Regeneron VelocImmune mouse; and the more recent Harbour Antibodies, H2L2 Mouse and Trianni Inc., Trianni Mouse [162, 165] (Table 4). The first antibody drug derived from transgenic mice was approved by the US FDA in 2006 [177], and as of 2019, 19 transgenic animal-derived antibody drugs [17–34, 177] generated by Xenomouse, HuMabMouse, and VelocImmune mouse are on the market (Table 5). Eight of the drugs are used for cancer treatment, while the others are for autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.\\n\",\r\n        \"There have been seven US FDA-approved antibody drugs generated from the XenoMouse (Table 5). In 2006, the first one, panitumumab (Vectibix, Amgen, human IgG2/kappa), was approved to treat the EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS [188]. This mAb blocks the interaction of EGFR and its ligands, resulting in the inhibition of EGFR signaling and induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Two antibody drugs from the XenoMouse are used for autoimmune dermatologic diseases. One, secukinumab (Cosentyx, Novartis, human IgG1), binds to proinflammatory cytokine IL-17α to reduce inflammation in psoriasis [189]. The other is brodalumab (Siliq, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, human IgG2), which binds to the IL-17 receptor to inhibit the action of IL-17 family cytokines. The two mAb drugs were approved by the US FDA for psoriasis treatment in 2015 and 2017, respectively.\",\r\n        \"From the HuMabMouse, there have also been eight antibody drugs approved by the US FDA (Table 5). Two drugs, ipilimumab (Yervoy, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG1) and nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb, human IgG4/kappa), are used for melanoma treatment; the drugs were approved in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, blocking its interaction with B7 on APCs and causing cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill cancer cells [190]. Nivolumab recognizes to PD-1, reducing inhibitory signaling to rehabilitate the immune response of tumor-specific T cells in patients [191]. Notably, nivolumab was also approved for non-small cell lung cancer treatment in 2018. Among the mAb drugs derived from the HuMabMouse, some are used for autoimmune diseases. For example, ustekinumab (Stelara, Johnson & Johnson, human IgG1/kappa) binds to cytokines, especially the p40 subunits of IL-12 and IL-23, blocking proinflammatory signaling to ease inflammation. This drug was approved for severe plaque psoriasis [17] in 2009 and for Crohn’s disease [192] in 2016.\",\r\n        \"The VelocImmune mouse is a second generation transgenic chimeric mouse and has yielded four approved drugs (Table 5). Dupilumab (Dupixent, Sanofi and Regeneron, human IgG4) binds to IL-4 receptor and inhibits the IL-4 and IL-13 pathway, as an eczema treatment. Sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi and Regeneron, human IgG1) inhibits IL-6 signaling by binding to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which otherwise would upregulate the release of rheumatoid arthritis-related factors from hepatocytes. The two drugs were both approved in 2017. Notably, despite having access to the XenoMouse and owning Cambridge Antibody Technology (the phage display company behind Humira), AstraZeneca paid over $120 million for a few breeding pairs of VelocImmune mice [193].\",\r\n        \"To improve the diversity of products and generate better antibody drugs, major development efforts have yielded models, such as the fully human antibody mouse and second-generation chimeric human antibody mice, over the 30 years since the first transgenic mouse was generated in 1989 [167]. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provides ever more possibilities for antibody drug development by global pharmaceutical factories.\",\r\n        \"Single B cells can be isolated from either PBMCs or lymphoid tissues using micromanipulation [198, 199], laser capture microdissection [200], and fluorescence-activated cell sorting [199, 201, 202]. Generally, mononuclear cells are purified from PBMCs or bone marrow by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Based on B cell expression of specific cell surface markers in different stages, isolation of single B cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting is widely utilized, especially in the identification of rare and discrete B cell subpopulations. Antigen-coated magnetic beads [203] and fluorescence-conjugated antigens [204–206] are also often used to select antigen-specific B cells in a process known as antigen baiting. Neutralizing human mAbs against Puumala virus were generated from B cells isolated using antigen-coated magnetic beads [207]. Recently, antigen-conjugated fluorescent beads have been used to identify antigen-specific B cells [208]. Fluorescent virus-like particles of rotavirus served as antigen bait for single RV-specific B cells, which had been extracted from healthy rotavirus-infected infants or adult donors [209]. HIV envelope protein antigens have also been used to isolate antibodies that broadly neutralize HIV-1 [210, 211]. Moreover, isolation of dengue virus-specific memory B cells was reported [212, 213]. Thus, antigen baiting may be applied as a preliminary selection tool to be used on a polyclonal mixture.\",\r\n        \"After single B cell sorting, direct cloning of each Ig heavy chain and corresponding light chain should be performed [201, 202]. This step involves the use of nested or semi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for amplification of the variable heavy and light chain of each identified B cell. Usually, forward primers are directed toward IgH and IgL variable leader sequences and reverse primers are complementary to the Ig constant region [201, 214]. By optimizing different primer-set mixtures, the recoveries of the VH and VL may be improved [201, 215]. The genes are then cloned and expressed in mammalian cell lines for the immediate generation of recombinant mAbs. Following the detection of mAb reactivity, the characteristics of each generated mAb are determined. Furthermore, for high-throughput screening and evaluation of secreted mAbs with ideal reactivity, a cell-based microarray chip system [216] and microengraving techniques [217–220] have been described. The cell-based microarray chip system, immunospot array assay on a chip, enables the trapping of secreted antibodies by a chip that is coated with antibody against Ig, therefore, it is used to identify and recover specific antibody-secreting cells [216]. The microengraving method depends on the use of a soft lithographic technique to generate microarrays comprising the secreted antibodies of single cells [217]. These two approaches offer the advantages of early and rapid identification of clones with high affinity and specificity to the antigen of interest.\",\r\n        \"In the face of threats from novel emergent pathogens, the rapid development of immunotherapies or insights into the diversity of antibody repertoire are beneficial, and single B cell sorting provides a highly efficient technology to achieve these goals. In the past, human mAbs have been generated by the single B cell method for bacterial, parasitic, virus infected or autoimmune diseases.\",\r\n        \"Among bacteria, Bacillus anthracis is one of the most concerning species. B. anthracis is a fatal pathogen that causes severe anthrax disease in humans and has been used as a biological weapon. Although antibiotics are available for anthrax treatment and as post-exposure prophylaxis, anti-anthrax protective antibodies from single human B cells will still be a crucial addition to the treatment toolkit [221, 222]. In an example targeting yeast infections, anti-Candida mAbs antibodies derived by the single human B cell method can enhance phagocytosis to protect against disseminated candidiasis [223].\",\r\n        \"The single B cell method has also successfully yielded anti-viral mAbs. Rapid isolation of dengue-neutralizing antibodies from human antigen-specific memory B-cell cultures [224] and characterization of antigen-specific B cells in the peripheral blood of DENV-immune individuals [213] were both reported. In another example, Iizuka and colleagues described the identification of cytomegalovirus pp65 antigen-specific human mAbs using single B cell-based antibody gene cloning [225]. For rotavirus, the single B cell method was performed to analyze the rotavirus antibody gene repertoire of VP6-specific B cells in naive and memory B cell subsets [226] and generate rotavirus-specific human mAbs by sorting single B cells from small-intestinal mucosa [227]. Human mAbs against zika virus NS1 have also been generated by the single B cell method [228]. Besides mAbs for bacterial and virus infection, the single human B cell method has also yielded a complement factor H (CFH) therapeutic antibody for cancer. The recombinant anti-CFH antibody can induce complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) through complement activation and release of anaphylatoxins [229].\",\r\n        \"Many virus-targeting mAbs are also currently in clinical trials. For example, Ebolavirus is a highly lethal pathogen that causes 25–90% mortality in humans. Therapeutic mAbs for ebolavirus infection have been derived from B cells of vaccinated human donors or survivors [230–232]. Impressively, human mAb114, which is derived from sorted memory B cells targeted to the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein, protects macaques when administered as late as 5 days after challenge [231]. Clinical trials for this drug are at Phase I (NCT03478891), Phase II and III (NCT03719586).\",\r\n        \"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by HIV, and an estimated 36.9 million people worldwide are infected. HIV-1 envelope protein is an attractive therapeutic target for antibody and vaccine design. Five human mAbs against anti-HIV envelope protein have been generated by the single B cell approach and are under evaluation in clinical trials (3BNC117, Phase I/II; 10–1074, Phase I; VRC01, Phase I/II; PGT121, Phase I/II and N6, Phase I) [233]. A Phase I clinical trial (NCT02579083) is also being conducted on the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus by MB 66 combined with an anti-herpes simplex virus antibody (AC8) and an anti-HIV antibody (VRC01).\",\r\n        \"Different influenza viruses cause epidemics ever year, and influenza vaccines are the most useful measure to prevent seasonal influenza. Single B cell isolation for the generation of potent and broadly neutralizing anti-influenza antibodies has become a popular undertaking [234, 235]. MHAA4549A, a human mAb targeting the hemagglutinin stalk of influenza A virus was cloned from a single human plasmablast cell from an influenza virus vaccinated donor [236]. A Phase II clinical trial of MHAA4549A as a monotherapy for acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza A in otherwise healthy adults was recently completed (NCT02623322). CT P27, which contains two human mAbs (CT P22 and CT P23), was created by Celltrion and is in Phase II (NCT03511066). RG 6024, also named MHAB5553A, was generated by Genentech with a modified version of the single B cell isolation method [237]; it is currently under examination in Phase I (NCT02528903) trial. The Phase II trial for another antibody, TCN 032, was stopped in 2012 (NCT01719874).\",\r\n        \"Profiling of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody repertoires from the memory B cells of naturally infected adults [238] or generation of neutralizing antibodies from RSV-infected infants [239] has been undertaken as well. MEDI8897, an anti-RSV antibody developed by MedImmune, is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in Phase II clinical trial (NCT02878330).\",\r\n        \"Over the past decade, generation of mAbs by single B cell technology has become increasingly attractive. However, there are still no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs developed by this method that is used for clinical treatment of any disease. Although single B cell technology possesses several irreplaceable advantages, there are still challenges to be overcome. For example, the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the design of primer sets are all important considerations for successful generation of mAbs. In the future, recovery of mAbs from single B cell platforms may be a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for development of novel diagnostics, pharmacokinetic applications, and clinical therapeutics.\",\r\n        \"Phage display and yeast display have been widely used for affinity maturation of antibodies, due to their amenability to easily screen for high affinity variants and to high throughput applications [81]. Methods for increasing antibody affinity can be broadly divided into two broad categories. The first is to generate a large randomly mutated library of CDR or entire variable domain sequences, followed by a selection of higher affinity variants from this large number of mutants. Another approach is to prepare small libraries by focused mutagenesis or hotspot mutagenesis that mimics in vivo affinity maturation. In this focused method, a high affinity variant is selected to be randomized at individual positions in each of the six CDRs or at a discrete point in the variable domain called the hotspot. The usual practice is to combine different mutations, resulting in small increases in affinity. The combination of these different mutations may have an additive or synergistic effect that can result in substantial increases in the affinity of the antibody to the antigen [245]. Phage display technology can be employed to identify high affinity antibodies in an antibody gene mutation library under stringent biopanning conditions, including decreased antigen amount, extended incubation and intensive washing steps or by competition with soluble antigen [104, 246]. Using phage display with VH and VL CDR3 mutation libraries, the affinity of anti-HER2 antibody was improved more than 1200-fold [97].\",\r\n        \"Diversification of antibody genes is the initial step of affinity maturation in vitro, and this step may be achieved using various strategies, such as random mutations, targeted mutations or chain shuffling [246]. Mutations can be randomly introduced into the variable regions of antibody genes by error-prone PCR in mutator E. coli strains [247, 248]. Chain shuffling approaches are those in which one of two chains, VH and VL, is fixed and recombined with a repertoire of partner chains to produce a next-generation library [249]. Moreover, mutations can be introduced to particular regions of the antibody gene. This type of targeting mutation approach was employed to diversify CDR residues and was shown to be effective in ameliorating the affinity of antibodies [250]. Therefore, this method is more relevant to in vivo somatic mutations during B cell evolution because mutations accumulate more efficiently in the CDR than framework residues.\",\r\n        \"The field of therapeutic antibodies has undergone rapid growth in recent years, becoming a dominant force in the therapeutics market. However, there is still significant growth potential for the therapeutic antibody field. Traditionally, antibodies have been used for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. If the molecular mechanisms of a specific disease can be clearly elucidated and the specific proteins or molecules involved in pathogenesis can be identified, antibodies may provide an effective therapeutic option. For example, anti-CGRP receptor antibodies (erenumab, galcanezumab, or fremanezumab) have been developed for the prevention of migraine. Anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) antibodies (evolocumab or alirocumab) are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Anti-fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) antibody (burosumab) is used to treat X-linked hypophosphatemia. Anti-IL6R antibody (sarilumab and tocilizumab) can be used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-Factor IXa/Xa antibody (emicizumab) is a valuable treatment for hemophilia A. Anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (caplacizumab) is approved for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and other antibodies will be approved for new indications in the near future.\",\r\n        \"Therapeutic antibodies can roughly be separated into two broad categories (Fig. 5). In the first category, the naked antibody is directly used for disease therapy. Cancer treatments from this category may act through several different mechanisms, including mediated pathways (e.g., ADCC/CDC), direct targeting of cancer cells to induce apoptosis, targeting the tumor microenvironment, or targeting immune checkpoints. In mediated pathways, the antibody kills cancer cells by recruiting natural killer cells or other immune cells. Recently, new technological developments have been made to enhance the therapeutic effects of ADCC or CDC, such as antibody Fc point mutations [251–253] or modification of glycosylation [254–258] to improve cancer cell killing capabilities. The direct induction apoptosis in cancer cells has traditionally been the preferred mechanism for therapeutic antibodies. With regard to targeting the tumor microenvironment, antibodies can inhibit tumorigenesis by targeting factors involved in cancer cell growth. For example, Avastin targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to inhibit blood vessel growth around the tumor, shutting down the supply of nutrients required for the cancer cell growth. Immune checkpoints have proven to be valuable targets for cancer treatment. In the future, studies evaluating synergistic effects of antibodies and chemotherapeutic drugs, radiotherapy or other biologic agents will greatly benefit the further development of antibody therapeutics. Furthermore, the identification of novel biomarkers may improve the efficacy and specificity of antibody-based therapy for human diseases.\\n\",\r\n        \"In the second category of antibody drugs, additional modifications are made to the antibody in order to enhance its therapeutic value. Some general approaches include immunocytokines, antibody-drug conjugate, antibody-radionuclide conjugates, bispecific antibodies, immunoliposomes, and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. To create an immunocytokine, a selected cytokine is fused to an antibody to enhance delivery specificity [259]. Antibody drug conjugates consist of an antibody that targets a cancer-specific marker conjugated to the small molecule drug; the antibody enhances delivery to the tumor site, increasing the efficacy of the small molecule while reducing side effects by reducing non-specific toxicity to non-target tissues [260]. The antibody may also be conjugated to a radionuclide, in order to direct radiotherapy more specifically to the tumor site [261]. For bispecific antibodies, antibodies targeting two receptors are engineered to further enhance therapeutic effects [262]. Antibody-engaged effector cell functions may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bispecific antibodies. With regard to immunoliposomes, the binding site of the antibody (scFv or Fab) is cleaved from the constant region and subsequently conjugated to different nano-drug delivery systems, such as liposomal drugs, to provide more specific targeting [263, 264]. Lastly, CAR-T involves inserting the gene for a chimeric T cell receptor-antibody targeting a specific cancer marker into T cells, such that the engineered cells target and kill cancer cells [265, 266]. In recent years, this approach has garnered major attention from the scientific and medical community due to its significant clinical benefits to cancer patients. In many cases, patients have experienced complete remission or even been completely cured of cancer [267–271].\",\r\n        \"Although new methods have been well-established for generating fully human antibodies, such as human antibody transgenic mice and human single B cell antibody techniques, phage display still has advantages as an antibody drug discovery platform, based on its efficient and economical in vitro selection methodology. Recently, some advanced techniques have been applied in antibody discovery, including high-throughput robotic screening [272], next generation sequencing [273] and single cell sequencing [274, 275]. These techniques are expected to greatly accelerate the identification of specific phage binders, facilitating mAb development for use in research, clinical diagnostics, and pharmaceuticals for the treatment of human disease.\",\r\n        \"By reviewing currently approved mAbs, one may easily see how sophisticated formats were developed in response to challenges posed by therapeutic indications. These mAb engineering solutions are highlighted by antibody-drug conjugates, glycoengineered mAbs, immunomodulators, bispecific mAbs, and CAR-T cells.\",\r\n        \"Here, we summarize five technical platforms that are related to the production of therapeutic antibodies, including chimeric antibodies, humanization, phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology (Fig. 3d). Phage display, transgenic mice, and single B cell antibody technology have proven to be reliable methods for the generation of human antibodies. As enormous storehouses of antibody encoding genes (> 1010) with unknown properties, high quality (antibody diversity) phage antibody libraries are critical to the successful identification of therapeutic mAbs. In addition, an optimal selection from phage display libraries is dependent on target antigen quality, antigen immobilization, and tight control of binding and wash conditions. Furthermore, careful pre-screening design of conditions can tailor the characteristics of antibodies discovered from biopanning, including conformation specificity, epitope specificity, internalization, neutralization, and interspecies cross-reactivity. Currently, there are nine fully human antibodies that were discovered from phage libraries approved for therapy, and dozens more phage-derived antibody therapeutics are in clinical trials, waiting to enter the market [149] (Table 5).\",\r\n        \"In order to improve the quality of antibody drugs, researchers have developed several transgenic animals, including fully human mice and second-generation human chimeric mouse. The continued refinement and advancement of transgenic animals provide more options for antibody drug development in global pharmaceutical factories. All the transgenic-derived mAbs approved for therapeutic use have come from from three companies: Abgenix (XenoMouse) [36], Medarex (HuMAbMouse) [35], and Regeneron (VelocImmune) [165]. Depending on the immunization protocol, high affinity human antibodies can be obtained through selection of the clones generated in the animals. This selection is mainly accomplished by hybridoma technology. Currently, there are 19 approved human mAbs that were discovered from these three transgenic animals (Table 5).\",\r\n        \"Over the past decade, generation of mAbs from isolated single B cells has become an increasingly attractive approach. To date, no US FDA-approved therapeutic mAbs have been derived from this method; however, it possesses several major advantages, and ongoing challenges are currently being solved. The success of the method relies heavily on the antigen labeling technique, the configuration of sorting antigens (e.g., monomer or dimer) and the set of primers used for amplification. In the future, the recovery of mAbs from single B cells is expected to become a powerful tool in combination with next generation sequencing for diagnostics, pharmacokinetic application, and clinical therapeutics.\",\r\n        \"As a result of highly active development of antibody drugs in recent decades, mAbs have emerged among the major class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of many human diseases, especially cancers, immunological, infectious, neural and metabolic diseases. Sales growth and regulatory approval of mAb products were slow until the late 1990s when the first chimeric mAbs were approved (annual sales of $0.3 billion in 1997). With the subsequent approval of humanized and then fully human mAbs, the rate of product approvals and sales of mAb products has increased rapidly, with global sales revenue for all mAb products at $115.2 billion in 2018 (Fig. 1) [276]. The continued growth of mAb products in the coming years is expected to be a major driver of overall biopharmaceutical product sales.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31894001/\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst similar_paper_1_1 = [\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7207137\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1053/j.jvca.2020.05.004\",\r\n    title:\r\n      \"COVID-19 outbreak in France: Setup and activities of a mobile Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) team during the first 3 weeks\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2020-05-08\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Guillaume.Haye\",\r\n      \"Alex.Fourdrain\",\r\n      \"Osama.Abou-Arab\",\r\n      \"Pascal.Berna\",\r\n      \"Yazine.Mahjoub\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Start of the outbreak in Picardy\",\r\n          \"Start of the outbreak in Picardy\",\r\n          \"Setting up the mobile ECMO team\",\r\n          \"Setting up the mobile ECMO team\",\r\n          \"Number of calls and patients’ characteristics\",\r\n          \"Number of calls and patients’ characteristics\",\r\n          \"Declaration of Competing Interest\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"conclusions\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"Located in the north of France, Picardy region has a population of 1.925 million inhabitants on a 19 399 km² territory. A network of 29 general hospitals is located on this regional territory, with 128 intensive care units (ICU) beds. The only ICU of Picardy with the ability to manage ECMO is the Cardiac Thoracic Vascular and Respiratory Unit of Amiens University medical Centre. The unit initiated about 60 ECMO treatments every year (one third of veno-venous ECMO) for more than 10 years.\",\r\n        \"The outbreak occurred in Picardy at the end of February 2020 resulting in a rapid tension on ICU beds. Calls from peripheral centres for ECMO need increased rapidly. In one month (March 2020), 676 patients were admitted in the hospitals of the region for COVID-19 related disease. Among them 156 patients required ICU admission (admission rate: 23.1%).3\\n\",\r\n        \"Clustering infected patients requiring ECMO within an expert centre was necessary in order to insure adequate care and resource management.\",\r\n        \"A unique phone number was publicized to all ICUs of the region in order to centralize request for ECMO. An on-call ECMO team member was able to give advice and to evaluate the need for ECMO. All ECMO team members were educated on the management and the eligibility criteria for ECMO initiation. The mobile ECMO team was composed by a specialized intensivist, a thoracic surgeon and a trained perfusion nurse. A roster was started in order to make the team available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Decision to initiate ECMO treatment was always a multi-consultant decision. The ECMO team was able to reach any hospital of the region in less than 45 minutes (by road or by air depending on the weather). The ECMO team decided on arrival to retrieve the patient on conventional ventilation or to initiate ECMO on site and transfer the patient on ECMO support. Patients under ECMO were admitted in a specialized ICU with trained staff. The Cardiohelp® (Maquet Medical system, Wayne, USA) ECMO device was used for each transport because of its compact and light design (10kg).\",\r\n        \"During March 2020, 22 calls were received at our ECMO centre. The ECMO team initiated 8 veno-venous ECMO treatments on site and transferred 3 patients on conventional ventilation. For all patients, the drainage cannula (size of 25 Fr) was inserted in the right femoral vein and the return cannula (size of 19 Fr) was inserted in the right jugular vein. Heparin treatment was started after the procedure with continuous perfusion of unfractioned heparin for an anti-XA level target of 0,2-0,4 UI.ml−1. Despite this treatment, canula thrombosis occurred for 2 patients leading to procedure failure and death of the patients. This is probably due to the high inflammatory state that increases the risk of thrombosis as suggested in some reports.4 The ECMO team was not available 3 times due to simultaneous calls. Only one ECMO was initiated during night shift. Four patients (50%) were discharged from ICU. Characteristics, outcomes and complications of patients were detailed in table 1\\n. The role of ECMO in covid-19-related ARDS is still unclear. To date, only limited case-series are available. Our report is in accordance with previous reports on limited cases-series of Covid-19 patients under ECMO support. Li et al. reported a similar rate of 50% of weaning for 8 patients under ECMO.5 Jacobs et al. in a larger case-series of 32 covid-19 patients under ECMO, have a weaning rate of 16% (5/32) but the majority of their ECMO treatment were still ongoing at time of publication.6 To the contrary to other team, we performed only veno-venous ECMO therapies as all treated patients were hemodynamically stable without acute ventricular dysfunction.7\\n\",\r\n        \"To conclude, the setup of a mobile ECMO team within an experienced ECMO centre is feasible and may help to tackle the outbreak. To date, there is only limited case-series on ECMO for covid-19 patients and larger studies are mandatory to draw any conclusion. However, sharing experience between ECMO expert centers is necessary to improve our practice.\",\r\n        \"The authors have no conflict of interest to declare\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: {

United States in 1981, after which AIDS began to spread worldwide. As of the end of 2011, the number of HIV-positive people worldwide had reached 34 million. In response to this situation, the United Nations released its 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS. As of 2012, 186 countries or 96 % of United Nations members had submitted a report on their national AIDS-response measures (UNAIDS) [4]. Figure 5.1 indicates the size of HIV-positive populations, showing from left to right the infection rates among adults, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. It is striking that the HIV-positive rate among drug injectors is 22 times higher than among the general population.\\n\",\r\n        \"The background to this situation regarding HIV infection is a story of massive spread of infection through an accident with ‘high-risk biotechnologies’ [5]. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal refers to a series of cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, caused by the failure to apply safety measures to blood products. Included in these blood products were coagulation-factor products, which are pharmaceuticals effective against hemophilia. The raw material for these products is prepared from the blood of many donors, and the lack of a procedure for virus inactivation left no defense against viral infection. The reported discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 led to concerns over the risk of infection through blood products, but despite the warnings from many specialists, the use of these products continued and resulted in some 2,000 cases of HIV infection. According to a 1997 White Paper from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, of the 4,028 people with HIV as of February 1997, 1,872 had been infected by blood products. Meanwhile, of the 1,484 people who had developed AIDS symptoms, 641 had been infected by blood products. The reality was that almost half of those with HIV infection were victims of the scandal. This affair raised issues regarding the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the culpability of the involved organizations and individuals in industry (pharmaceutical manufacturers); in government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare); and in academia (the AIDS Research Group led by Dr. Z).\",\r\n        \"Iatrogenic HIV infection differs from many other cases of iatrogenic drug damage in that it is a ‘progressive condition’. What this means is that even when use of the drugs stops, the progression of the symptoms does not. This is because iatrogenic HIV infection arises not from the drug’s side-effects, as with most other cases of iatrogenic drug damage, but from viral contamination of the blood that is the raw material for the drugs (Osaka HIV) [6]. In the absence of effective therapy, HIV causes a gradual weakening of the immune system, leading to the onset of AIDS. As of July 1998, there had been 493 deaths from iatrogenic HIV infection, while the number infected was 1,434, of whom 631 had developed AIDS. The number of deaths continues to increase. The fact that many children were affected is another distinctive feature of iatrogenic HIV infection, making all the more urgent the task of limiting the damage and developing therapies. Of those affected, 14 % were 10 years old or younger, while 30 % were 15 years or below, and those aged 20 or below accounted for more than half of all victims. This is why, in the first report by the Research Group for Preventive Therapies for People with HIV Infection, the group’s chief researcher, Professor K. Yamada, called iatrogenic HIV infection “one of the greatest medical tragedies of this century”. The group’s report is subtitled The AIDS Scandal [7].\",\r\n        \"Table 5.1 summarizes the iatrogenic HIV problem in terms of the number of HIV-infected people and the (estimated) number infected by blood products in the major developed countries. The number of people infected iatrogenically through pharmaceuticals is particularly high in the United States and France, indicating that the damage was spread through a combination of natural and human-made disasters. In many countries including Japan, court actions were brought against the government and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In Spain, where 90 % of blood-coagulant products were imports from the United States, it is reported that 82 % of the 2,700 hemophiliacs became infected with HIV (Osaka HIV) [8].\\n\",\r\n        \"In the case of the ‘non-heat-treated’ coagulation-factor products which were the medium of infection, although there were safety issues involved, the fact remained that they were effective for many hemophiliacs and user-friendly. The coagulation-factor products had a stronger pharmaceutical effect than the cryoprecipitate preparations which were candidate replacements, and, when symptoms became severe, there were apparently cases in which only coagulation-factor products could elicit recovery. Moreover, self-injection of coagulation-factor products by hemophiliacs was authorized in February 1983, offering a greater degree of user-friendliness than cryoprecipitate, which in principle had to be administered in a hospital. As HIV research was less advanced than nowadays, many doctors and patients opted for the immediate benefits of pharmaceutical efficacy and user-friendliness in the face of an unknown future risk, resulting in the unforeseen human-made medical disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection.\",\r\n        \"Central government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) continued to assume the role of the supervision and guidance authority for pharmaceutical approval and licensing in its relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pharmaceutical manufacturers submitted detailed reports on risk data and other information to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which provided them with guidance on the range of countermeasures. The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected information from overseas specialists, but this information was not communicated to medical treatment institutions, patients, or the general public. At the time of the first confirmed case, the Ministry tried to prepare a ‘soft landing’ for AIDS in Japan. Similarly, so as to avoid panic among the public and unequal treatment of companies, it continued to advocate a softly-softly approach. In court, too, the government went on to adopt the role of director and defender of the accused companies. In addition to this aspect, there was a strong significance attached to the fact that the disease was infectious, which meant that the damage spread through secondary and tertiary infection. Surprisingly, as the Ministry initially treated HIV as a public health and sanitation issue, it did not provide victims with medical treatment, relief or compensation, thinking of the infection rather as a social evil which needed to be rooted out and eliminated.\",\r\n        \"Detailed information on the timeline of the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal has appeared on the website of Life AIDS Project and in a book by Hitoshi Sakurai entitled Umoreta eizu hōkoku (The Buried AIDS Report) [9]. The timeline presented below was prepared with reference to these sources and is based on factual information already released into the public domain.\\n\",\r\n        \"Hemophilia, a disease in which constituents required for blood clotting and hemostasis are lacking or deficient for genetic reasons, requires medical treatment to supply these missing blood-coagulation factors. Cryoprecipitates products were used as drugs to control the disease [10]. As cryoprecipitate products are made from the pooled blood of one or at the most ten individuals, it was expected that they would be less likely to cause infection than coagulation-factor products, which are made from the pooled blood of between 2,000 and 20,000 people [11]. As the first cryoprecipitate were frozen products, their storage and use presented challenges, and patients had to be treated in hospital, but this problem was resolved by the dried cryoprecipitate developed in the early 1980s, and home treatment using cryoprecipitate did apparently take place in some cases. In countries such as Norway, which actually switched to cryoprecipitate, the rate of hemophiliac HIV infection was kept to low levels, indicating effective decision-making on health policy. This fact casts doubt on the basis of Dr. Z’s statement that ‘cryoprecipitate is liable to solidification’, and instead points to the difference in drug-price markup as one of the possible reasons why the switch to cryoprecipitate was not realized.\",\r\n        \"From 1984 until around 1985, many Japanese doctors viewed as specialists and many officials at the Ministry of Health and Welfare were apparently dominated by the ‘logical argument’ that “although use of blood products can lead to HIV infection, many patients have not developed symptoms. Infection and onset of symptoms are thus separate phenomena. Although ‘non-heated products’ may be a cause of HIV infection, they do not act to cause AIDS onset” [12]. AIDS is a disease of immune dysfunction caused by a virus called HIV. In a document published in 1986, Dr. Z maintained that confirmation of AIDS requires three conditions to be fulfilled [13]. The first was infection with the AIDS virus, which could be tested via the presence of antibodies. The second was reduced or insufficient immunocompetence. The fact that this reduction of immunocompetence occurs over time is one of the characteristics of AIDS. For reduced immune function to result in the onset of symptoms can take more than 10 years in many cases, until which time the patient may experience no more than a certain degree of fatigue, with no impairment of everyday activities. This is still one of the features that distinguish HIV infection from the onset of AIDS. The third of Dr. Z’s conditions was opportunistic infection, which appears as a result of weakened immunocompetence in the form of illnesses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma. As a result, medical treatment following the onset of AIDS consists of a constant battle with opportunistic infections.\",\r\n        \"Figure 5.2 shows the number of new HIV and AIDS infections and deaths in the two subsequent decades from 1990 to 2010. Many HIV-infected patients die each year; the total number of those infected is shown in the figure. When we consider also the number of AIDS deaths due to non-pharmaceutical-related natural infection, such as infection through unprotected sex or needle-sharing, the extent of the tragedy is immeasurable. The problem of iatrogenic AIDS thus continues into the present.\\n\",\r\n        \"In the case of iatrogenic HIV infection, the main point of legal contention was at what juncture pharmaceutical manufacturers and the Ministry of Health and Welfare had become aware of the risk from non-heated products. The case in point in the criminal trial was that of a liver-disease patient treated with non-heated products from the pharmaceutical company Green Cross Corporation in April 1986. The court attempted to trace why the president of the corporation had not recalled the products, and why Mr. Y, the then head of the Biologics and Antibiotics Division at the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, had not ordered a recall.\",\r\n        \"Since pharmaceutical manufacturers were also in a position to access risk data, they were unable to deny their involvement in the manufacture and sale of drugs potentially contaminated with the virus. Information from pharmaceutical manufacturers was reported to the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, but was not communicated to the hemophiliacs who were the product consumers. The Ministry thereby clearly neglected its duty to warn patients and the public. As for non-heated products, while most other countries reduced their imports, Japan sought to increase imports and even reduced the price as an incentive. The reason for the import of unsafe ‘non-heated products’ was quite simply the prioritization of earnings from the markup on the drug price. This is the profit derived from the difference between the fixed domestic price for medical products and the price actually paid to the overseas supplier. The markup on non-heated products was particularly great. With cryoprecipitate products, in contrast, there was almost none. There are also issues associated with the actions of those involved after the danger was realized: even after heated products became available, they failed to urgently recall the non-heated products which they knew to be unsafe. By making false reports to the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the dates of market release and recall of non-heated products, the Green Cross Corporation engaged in fraud and misrepresentation compounding the damage, for which it bears a grave ‘social responsibility.’\",\r\n        \"Figure 5.3, stakeholders of the pharmaceutical industry, presents a diagrammatic illustration of the interest groups in the industry involved in the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing. As shown, Green Cross effectively engaged in bribery, which included making payments, disguised as ‘research funds’, to a foundation that Dr. Z was in the process of establishing, suggesting that the ‘business ethics’ of this pharmaceutical operator were very poor. Its approach, which prioritized its own interest at the expense of patients and the public, aggravated the damage. However, this kind of poor practice was not restricted to the corporate players; responsibility also lies with the government authorities that administered the pharmaceutical regulatory system, which became ever clearer as the Japanese media (NHK) delved more deeply into the scandal.\\n\",\r\n        \"The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had the role of providing supervision and guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Notwithstanding its name change to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare following a ministerial reorganization, its historic responsibility for the iatrogenic HIV infection remains, together with its duty to compensate patients and victims. This raises the question of the political and administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities. Although it may not have been deliberately responsible, if it is the case that the former Ministry of Health and Welfare sacrificed the health of hemophiliacs for the sake of pharmaceutical manufacturers’ profit, then the regulatory authority itself has become a malignant influence on society, a situation that calls for the establishment of an ethical code for government organizations. The pharmaceutical regulatory system has been called a ‘web of vested interests’. The sorting of good medicines from bad is carried out under government guidance through a process known as pharmaceutical inspection, but, paradoxically, there is greater interest vested in bad medicines than in good medicines. Pharmaceutical companies make massive capital investment in drug development and have to adapt to new raw materials and a new production line for each new drug. They need to recoup this investment, and the development of a single drug is thus a kind of venture project that can determine the entire fate of the company.\",\r\n        \"Because of this, once a drug had been developed, since it was no longer possible to halt the investment in the associated production plant, the company would approach official bodies and the specialist committees and research groups that had the effective decision-making authority within the pharmaceutical-inspection system of the former Ministry of Health and Welfare with the intention of having the drug approved, regardless of its merit. It was this network of interests surrounding pharmaceutical regulation that formed the backdrop to the tragedy of iatrogenic HIV infection. Meanwhile, the inspection procedures and clinical studies involved in drug licensing under the government regulatory system require time, something which often stands in the way of delivering medical treatment to patients who need the drug. Indeed, one wonders what the purpose of the government regulatory system is, and whether the clinical studies involved in pharmaceutical inspection have any useful effect. The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal provoked a loss of confidence in the pharmaceutical regulatory system, and the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and initiated a fundamental questioning of the whole of Japan’s medical-treatment policy.\",\r\n        \"The administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities involved in the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) was the focus of the court case. In court, the basis for the questioning of the Ministry’s responsibility was the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was amended in 1979 in response to the SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) case. The amendment gave the Ministry the authority to close down the supply of a pharmaceutical where there was the risk of it creating or aggravating a health or safety hazard. At issue was the failure to exercise this authority, in other words negligence on the part of the regulatory authority. Specifically, it can be pointed out, for instance, that Japan lagged behind the United States by 2 years and 4 months in the approval of heated products. This was largely attributable to the coordination of clinical studies by Dr. Z, but another probable issue was the structure whereby the former Ministry of Health and Welfare’s pharmaceutical-licensing operation was dependent on a small number of specialists. Table 5.2 summarizes the dates from which HIV-antibody testing and heat treatments of concentrated products were made obligatory.\\n\",\r\n        \"Documents now made public suggest that, although the former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected a large amount of risk data, it not only did not make the data public but may actually have manipulated the advice from the FDA. AIDS was first recognized in Japan on March 22, 1985, with the reporting of the case of a male homosexual resident in the United States, which became known as the Juntendo University case. The patient survived for 10 years after diagnosis, and, although infected with HIV, is thought to have been yet to develop AIDS at that time. In contrast, a hemophiliac who died in July 1983, known as the Teikyo University case, was not recognized as an AIDS patient. It has been claimed that this was because the former Ministry of Health and Welfare tried to conceal the fact of hemophiliac HIV infection. Even subsequent to the licensing of heated products, the Ministry exacerbated the damage by failing to order pharmaceutical manufacturers to recall unheated products. Underlying this lax leadership is a readily perceptible collusion between the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Green Cross Corporation of those days was described as an outpost of the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and the practice of amakudari, whereby officials from the Ministry frequently retired into sinecure positions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, led to the formation of strong collusive relationships in the area of pharmaceutical approval and licensing (Mainichi Shimbun Shakaibu) [14].\",\r\n        \"As shown in Fig. 5.4, the background to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal was formed not only by the various contributions of industry, government and academia, but also by the undeniable fact of mutual interorganizational relationships among the three based on an ‘industrial protection policy’ peculiar to what has been called Japan Inc. It was surely the collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia based on the ‘vulnerable systems’ in Japanese society [15]—a negative result of the interrelationship of organizations in Japan’s industrial society—that lay behind the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal.\\n\",\r\n        \"The head of the AIDS Research Group, Dr. Z, was at the time Japan’s foremost expert in hemophilia treatment, and was thus an influential and authoritative voice in the field of medicine relevant to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal. The AIDS Research Group was in fact heavily involved in important decisions that led to the compounding of the damage from the iatrogenic HIV infection, such as the decision not to switch from coagulation-factor products to cryoprecipitate products. Specifically, at the meeting of the Home Treatment Promotion Committee on October 18, 1983, Dr. Z said in respect of his earlier claim that ‘cryoprecipitate tends to solidify’ that it might not be true. At a time when there were doubts over the safety of blood products, a grave responsibility attaches to his decisions not to switch to cryoprecipitate products, and then to delay the clinical study of the heated products when he should have been working to provide a safer drug as quickly as possible. In connection, it was found that doctors had had financial dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which was proven by the fact that Green Cross had made donations, disguised as research funds, to a foundation established by Dr. Z.\",\r\n        \"As part of the July 1997 reorganization of the pharmaceutical regulatory structure recommended in the 1997 Annual Report on Health and Welfare, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau was abolished, and the Health Policy Bureau took control of policy on the promotion of pharmaceutical research and development, pharmaceutical production and distribution, and related aspects. Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau was created to oversee the broad range of safety measures relating to medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, such as pharmaceutical clinical studies, approval and inspection, post-marketing safety measures, and measures to prevent infection within medical-treatment institutions. In parallel, as part of a strategic upgrade and reorganization of testing and research institutions, the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences was reconstituted as the National Institute of Health Sciences, and was equipped with a Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center to promote survey and research work on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs and strengthen pharmaceutical inspection. To coincide with the reorganization, there was a systematic increase in the number of staff assigned to pharmaceutical inspection work, and the inspection system was changed: whereas previously the actual work of inspection had been delegated to the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, whose members were drawn from the outside, the core work of pharmaceutical inspection was now to be carried out in-house by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center, with the Council’s role specialized to cover high-level assessment. Urgent steps were to be taken to set up a corresponding system of responsibilities. The system of clinical-study principal investigators, which had been Dr. Z’s role in the licensing of heated products, was abolished.\",\r\n        \"The new medical-product approval and inspection system created by the reorganization of government agencies came into force in 1997. In subsequent administrative reforms, the former Ministry of Health and Welfare became the Ministry of Labor, Health and Welfare, and there were changes in the content of its administrative activities including services provided and approval and licensing operations. Under the previous system, Inspection Guidelines and Inspection Reports were submitted to the Investigation Committee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, which was made up of specialists from outside the Ministry. This system was replaced in November 2000 by a simplified format in which the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council participated in a so-called team inspection. This move appears to have been designed to shorten the time required for approval.\",\r\n        \"In the final analysis, the cause of the iatrogenic HIV infection lay in a system in which the government agencies that constituted the pharmaceutical regulatory authorities were essentially bypassed so that the effective ‘decision-making’ body for drug clinical-study approval was the specialist committee known as the AIDS Research Group, to which pharmaceutical manufacturers made donations in an effort to have their pharmaceuticals approved and licensed, thus interfering in the process of pharmaceutical approval and license renewal. In future, lessons must be drawn from the iatrogenic HIV infection, and reform must be applied to the web of interests in the pharmaceutical industry and its system of cozy collusive relationships with government agencies. The poor practice and collusive relationships arising from the network of interests linking the worlds of industry and government also exemplify the need to reform, in terms of both policies and systems, the ethos and culture which became entrenched during Japan’s earlier period of rapid economic growth. An existing organizational culture must not be allowed to prevent the organization from learning to find its way in a new age. Dismantling the old culture of the past and creating a new culture is an important process. The culture of poor practice which is latent within the pharmaceutical regulatory system and the pharmaceutical industry represents a form of ‘organizational inertia’ which still today retains the power to act against the public interest. The culture and ethos latent in this network of collusive relationships among Japanese industry, government, and academia may need to be the subject of creative destruction as we move into the near future.\",\r\n        \"It is clear that responsibility for the organizational disaster of iatrogenic HIV infection lies at once with industry, government, and academia, but the background to this is the industrial-protection policy of Japan Inc., which is deeply rooted in the culture of the pharmaceutical industry. The system for approval and licensing, as administered by the regulatory government authority for each industry, itself spawned a network of collusive relationships among industry, government, and academia through practices such as amakudari, donations from private-sector bodies to the public sector, and expense-account entertaining. The case of iatrogenic HIV infection can be seen as a negative result of this relationship between business and government. This underlines the fragility of the ‘cultural ethos’ [16] of Japanese industrial organizations and typifies a system common to all of Japanese industrial society: a veritable ‘Galapagos, a strange, isolated world’.\",\r\n        \"Human-made disasters such as the phenomenon of iatrogenic AIDS infection outlined above have an inevitable ‘teleconnection’ with natural disasters. New viral strains and infectious diseases are one form of ‘unsafety threatening humankind.’ Historically, tuberculosis, cholera, plague, influenza, AIDS, and other infectious diseases have claimed many victims. More recently, the worldwide spread of SARS and avian influenza in 2003 is fresh in our memory. There are fears of epidemics of the three major infectious diseases (AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis) arising from the ‘biological hazard’ caused by the world population explosion to 7.2 billion. The particular danger of biological hazard is its exponential pattern of spread. Explosive damage arises through bacterial and viral infection via living organisms, person-to-person infection, or cross-species infection, for example from cattle to humans through bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), and foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, rubella infection in pregnant women may cause cataracts and glaucoma, congenital heart disease, hearing impairment, and other conditions in the fetus, while congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) poses the risk of damage to the next generation. Whether this is regarded as a case of human-made or natural selection, the result is the same: the disaster leads to an indivisible resonance phenomenon, the negative interaction of which causes the accelerated spread of ‘unsafety’.\",\r\n        \"The WHO has published Fig. 5.5 worldwide to signal the risk from biological hazards. The northward spread of infectious tropical diseases caused by recent global warming is proceeding at an ever-accelerating pace. Among the hazards facing the world, the proportion represented by these biological hazards is second in number only to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, typhoons and hurricanes, and accounts for one-third of all hazards.\\n\",\r\n        \"Meanwhile, there is concern that global warming’s disruption of the energy balance may allow the spread of infectious tropical diseases to the northern hemisphere. The serious prevalence of West Nile fever in the United States resulted from its being spread to the temperate zone of North America by travelers. In Japan, similarly, the example of the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti), which was discovered in Osaka Prefecture and has extended its habitat to the whole country, demonstrates that this is not an insubstantial problem. In particular the recent prevalence of Dengue-fever, whose incidence has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years, means that over 100 countries are threatened by the growth of the domain of infection (WHO) [17]. Figure 5.6 shows areas with high risk of Dengue-fever infection as of 2011. The lines to the north and south of the figure indicate the minimum temperature of 10 °C delineating the habitat limit of the mosquito that transmits the Dengue-fever virus. Advancing northward like an army, global warming is extending the habitat of the mosquitoes that transmit tropical viruses and is pushing the infection toward the northern hemisphere, which has a large land mass and is home to a large proportion of the human race. This poses a threat to the populations of these areas, who have no experience of or resistance to tropical viruses, diehard by global-warming.\\n\",\r\n        \"Not only the abovementioned infectious tropical diseases transmitted by bacteria and viruses, but also the risk of infection spread through global warming and the resulting crisis, will be of increasing concern going forward. For instance, since cholera bacteria live in symbiosis with plankton in seawater, the rise in sea temperatures, causing plankton to breed more prolifically, also leads to an increase in cholera bacteria, which has extended its infection zone northward. Already, it is reported that the 1991 El Niño phenomenon in South America has led to sharp year-on-year increases in cholera cases. The IPCC report from the end of September 2013 states that the world’s average atmospheric temperature rose by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 and predicts that the temperature rise by the year 2100 will be up to a maximum of 4.8 °C, leading to fears of a ‘Global Big Melt’, which will precipitate a worldwide struggle over water and food resources (IPCC) [18]. The freshwater available on the planet for human consumption as drinking water is said to represent 0.008 % of all the earth’s H2O, so a Global Big Melt would mean the depletion of the water resources for the human population of 7.2 billion now. Especially in the northern hemisphere, which contains a high proportion of the planet’s land mass, the melting of glaciers and permafrost soil to which the Big Melt refers is predicted to lead to the spread of viral infection to previously unaffected areas. Combined with ‘trans-global movement’ of travelers and migrants, and biological weapons, terrorism, and other disasters arising from human-made unsafety, these outbreaks could spread worldwide.\",\r\n        \"Governments and the responsible departments of regulatory authorities are loath to recognize ‘socio-biological hazard’. The leak and spread of radioactivity following the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, although a question of life and death for local residents, the wider community, and the Japanese population as a whole, were hidden by the government and the company involved. Socio-biological hazard thus cannot be controlled by central government policy or corporate management, which instead frequently responds with concealment or falsification of information. Nor is it susceptible to control by social or other systems. Outbreaks or pandemics of social or biological problems are accompanied by the breakdown of social functions, indicating the limitations of policy and management at the level of national government and business organization.\",\r\n        \"Unlike war, coups d’état, and conflict, the influx of people into an area of hazard results in new infections as contamination with the pathogen spreads along the chain among the members of families, communities, and organizations. National governments and the WHO have, albeit discreetly, sounded the alarm over the worldwide spread of locally endemic diseases not only through mosquitoes, ticks, and migratory birds, but also through human movement (travelers on business or otherwise). A crucial role in the infection zones has been played by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, known for its role in the discovery of SARS. In such a spread of infection, as in the model predicted by J. Reason, [19] accidents and disasters leak through security holes, author which suggests a resonance between human-made and natural disasters.\",\r\n        \"To summarize, the increased risks and crises brought about by global warming can emanate through leaks in physical, social, and biological defensive barriers. The resulting human-made disasters have already brought about systemic breakdown on various fronts. The ‘survivability’ which is a defensive barrier programmed into human DNA does not operate in C. I. Barnard’s so-called ‘zone of indifference’, where hazard is neither made known nor perceived. Consequently one could suggest, in many cases, hazard is only registered when a crisis emerges from the damage due to the spread of infection instigated in the breakdown of health and sanitation and other social systems and functions (Fig. 5.7).\\n\",\r\n        \"A comparison of viral outbreaks on a global scale, such as the worldwide pandemic of iatrogenic AIDS, reveals a similar structure. First of all, insufficient information disclosure allows an influx of people into the infection area; secondly, government measures to suppress infection and efforts at an organizational level by corporations or other bodies remain weak; and thirdly, there is a “zone of indifference outside the infection area.” These three factors create disregard for hazard information (de-civilization). Accurate publicity of ‘socio-biological hazard’ is therefore essential at the levels of international society, government, corporate organizations, and the individual, while also urgent are preventing unnecessary or unauthorized business visits or travel to the hazard area and other issues of organizational compliance and governance, together with Human Resource Management (HRM). The northward spread of tropical infectious diseases through global warming has created a need for social systems at various levels, including those of government, corporate organizations, and the individual. This means that the concept of an ‘eco-civilization’—promoting coexistence at the level of the social ecosphere, and associated disclosure of information—is the only viable approach to suppressing the combination of human-made and natural disasters that constitute socio-biological outbreaks and pandemics.\",\r\n        \"In April 2002, eastern Asia was struck by the SARS virus. Following the noble efforts made by the organization Médecins Sans Frontières, alerts were communicated worldwide through WHO. At the time, I was due to leave for a period of external research at IMD Lausanne, and my office urged me to proceed with the departure from Kansai Airport despite the risk of spreading the SARS infection. However, I defied them and postponed the departure. It was precisely on the day of my scheduled departure that Kansai Airport was subjected to a major disinfection operation as a precaution against SARS. The decision to postpone my departure after consulting my departmental head was a close call. If I had left on that day, I may have spread the infection to my research host institution at the IMD, and the SARS infection could have been transmitted after my return to many of my students and teaching colleagues. The conclusion to be drawn from this episode is that, going forward, whatever the field of work and in the management of organizations of all kinds, response to viral outbreaks will become an urgent task for participants in and administrators of business travel. I pray for the repose of the souls of those who died of SARS and influenza.\",\r\n        \"The recent hostage killings in Algeria and the deaths of journalists in Syria serve to illustrate that the managerial staff who issue the order for overseas business trips not only have managerial responsibility for the individual organization, but may also bear lifelong moral responsibility and a duty to compensate the families of injured junior staff for their trauma and emotional suffering. Accordingly, it has become essential for modern management to prepare for socio-biological hazard in organizational management by providing managerial staff with training in risk, crisis and resilience management. Reviewing the ups and downs of the Japanese economy, one recalls that, after the collapse of the bubble economy, a large portion of the sharply increased number of suicides from overwork that resulted from mass layoffs and staff cuts was represented by managerial staff which had fired their colleagues.\",\r\n        \"Coincidental though it may be, I was in the countries at the time of the military coup d’état under the Fujimori government in Peru and the coup d’état at Bangkok airport in Thailand. The Great East Japan Earthquake, the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake, and the death of a student in a Japan Railways accident are also among my various experiences of accident and disaster. It was because of these that I entered my present field of research with the aim of averting suffering caused by avoidable human-made disasters.

Among economic evaluations included in this review, incremental costs/ICERs were expressed in costs per healthcare-associated infection event prevented, but heterogeneity in reporting prevented meta-analysis conduction. Further, variable time horizons make comparisons of economic evaluations problematic (specifically ICERs) as costs and resource utilization may change over different time horizons. Changes in time horizons or perspectives can lead to differing parameters (costs [direct vs indirect], or outcomes [patient vs payer]). Many studies only reported incremental costs rather than true ICERs. Results from different perspectives, time horizons, and variable incremental cost reporting all represent disparate cost outcomes, which need to be interpreted carefully within context.\",\r\n        \"Moreover, there are large ranges in WTP, which are difficult to interpret with no conventional WTP benchmarks for prevention of VAP, CDAD, and AAD. Different countries may differ on values quality of life and WTP, making benchmarks difficult to establish across jurisdictions. Cost-utility parameters (like cost per life-year or QALY gained) were less commonly reported. If cost per QALYs were available, it would help to inform economic comparisons with other healthcare interventions.\",\r\n        \"Compared with other infection-prevention strategies, probiotics appear to be similarly cost-effective. A study examining concomitantly administered central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSIs) and VAP programs combined documented ICERs of 14,250.74 USD (20,533.24 CAD)/life-year gained and 23,277.86 USD (33,540.02 CAD)/QALY.47 Multifaceted quality improvement programs for reducing CLABSIs in ICUs have shown dominance (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in 80% of model scenarios using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.48 A proactive model infection-control program for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in general-surgical ICUs showed an ICER of 3,804 USD (5,320.01 CAD) per case averted of transmission of MDR organisms in one year compared with standard infection control. For a WTP threshold of 14,000 USD (19,579.43 CAD) per transmission averted, there is a 42% probability of being cost-effective, and 100% probability when WTP thresholds were 22,000 USD (30,767.68 CAD).49 These similarities suggest that adoption of probiotics for prevention of healthcare-associated infections could be cost-effective.\",\r\n        \"New interventions studied in economic evaluations are occasionally sponsored by drug manufacturers. This potentially introduces bias in model construction and interpretation of results.

The inclusion of only seven studies influences precision. Rare product-specific complications such as probiotic-induced complications (i.e., bacteremia) are unclear, underscoring the need for additional safety data. Overall GRADE certainty of evidence was very low for all outcomes, rendering conclusions non-definitive. Our review included only adult patients and may not be applicable to pediatric populations. Evaluated reports varied widely with respect to patient population, time horizon of therapy, and payer perspective, which challenges the generalizability and interpretation of these findings.\",\r\n        \"This systematic review found that probiotics may be an economically attractive strategy for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections in most studies. Nevertheless, our GRADE summary indicates a very low quality/certainty of evidence, such that inferences are weak regarding the health economic evaluation of probiotics in adult hospitalized patients. Future RCTs should include concomitant economic evaluations, including clinical outcomes and costs associated with probiotics, to inform bedside practice, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policy.

Healthcare resources and staff have been immediately redeployed towards COVID-19 management, with consultations for chronic diseases being canceled, postponed, or converted to tele-medicine [1, 2]. However, in the upcoming months, COVID-19 is expected to circulate and, thus, a large amount of consultations will be converted to tele-medicine, especially for diseases causing chronic disability and requiring immunomodulatory treatments, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) [3].\",\r\n        \"MS is characterized by acute-onset neurological symptoms (relapses), and chronic disability, which are primarily evaluated on neurological examination [4]. Following the COVID-19 emergency, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has published recommendations for implementing a tele-medicine service, suggesting that general neurological examination is feasible remotely, but with some caveats [5]. For instance, there are difficulties in comprehensive examination of eyes (i.e., fundoscopy), neuro-muscolar components (i.e., reflexes), and vestibular system (i.e., Dix-Hallpike maneuver), while the evaluation of other neurological systems depends on the tele-neurology setup (i.e., space enough for gait examination), and the availability of a caregiver to help (i.e., sensory examination) [5]. Remote examination could be further implemented with the use of digital technology, such as smartphone accelerometers for gait, posture, and balance assessment [6]. Similarly, over the past years, different studies have already explored the feasibility of remote counseling in MS, but have focused on specific aspects of the disease (e.g., treatment adherence, mental health) [7–9]. As such, there is no general agreement on MS-specific neurological examination on tele-consultations. Hereby, we have briefly reviewed available tools for remote evaluation of disability progression and relapses in MS, and have suggested a battery for tele-neurology examination in MS.\",\r\n        \"In MS, different neurological systems are combined into the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is the standard tool for clinical practice, observational studies, and clinical trials [4]. The possibility of assessing the EDSS remotely has been explored, but would require to use an “in-home neuro kit” with vision card, tuning fork, pin, cotton swab, and alcohol swab [10], to have a caregiver helping with the examination [9, 10], and to combine records from wearable devices (e.g., accelerometer-based step counts) [7, 9]. As such, remote EDSS faces some organizational issues, which would be difficult to overcome in the short term, but could be considered when strictly required (e.g., patients included in research protocols). Also, data from wearable devices should be interpreted cautiously, considering that the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological symptoms may not necessarily correspond to reduced physical activity in patients already self-isolating at home.\",\r\n        \"On the contrary, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) would remain entirely feasible online. The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) has been specifically developed as a PROM of MS disability and has been validated in multiple languages, and also for online administration [11]. The PDDS is strongly correlated to EDSS, and especially to visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and ambulatory functional systems, leaving brainstem and cerebral functions relatively unexplored [12]. As such, if patients are required to fill in the PDDS before tele-consultations, remote examination could specifically focus on brainstem function (e.g., ocular movements, trigeminal damage, hearing loss, dysarthria, and dysphagia), which is possibly easier to examine remotely or, at least, on history taking. Looking at cerebral function, different neuropsychological tests have been assessed for remote use [13]. Among them, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), which measures attention and processing speed, holds strong correlates to disability progression, and has been suggested as a screening tool for cognitive impairment in MS [14]. The oral version of the SDMT has already been validated for remote use (e.g., online or during functional-MRI acquisitions), is ideally suitable for all languages [14], and, thus, could be easily used on tele-neurology.\",\r\n        \"Relapses are defined as the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological abnormalities, which are separated by ≥ 30 days from the onset of the preceding event, last for ≥ 24 h, and occur without fever or infection [4, 15]. Thus, if some elements are relatively easy to evaluate on remote history taking (e.g., timeline, concomitant fever or symptoms of infection), neurological abnormalities would need to be detected as suggested above, along with other neurological tests in relation to reported symptoms. However, relapses also affect quality of life and activities of daily living [15], and, thus, the inclusion of MS-specific PROMs measuring physical and psychological health could support the assessment of relapse severity. For instance, the MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29) has been used in clinical trials to evaluate recovery from relapses [15], and has been tested for remote administration [16]. Alternative scales could be considered depending on prevalent patients’ symptoms (e.g., mood, fatigue). However, in-person examination and/or MRI should be considered for cases where a relapse cannot be fully ruled out, in order to make timely treatment decisions [4].\",\r\n        \"Overall, we have suggested a battery for MS assessment in tele-neurology, which strongly leverages patients’ empowerment and PROMs (Table 1). In particular, we recommend MS patients fill in the PDDS and the MSIS-29 before the tele-consultation, so that neurologists have a full view on the overall physical and psychological status. Then, during the tele-consultation, neurologists can focus on history taking and examination of brainstem function and other neurological systems, as required by patients’ symptoms. Finally, if necessary, the examiner could administer the oral version of the SDMT by showing the test form on patients’ screen. Alternatively, patients could be provided with PDDS, MSIS-29, and an electronic version of the SDMT [17], for self-assessment, and, then, request tele-neurology if necessary. The PDDS, the MSIS-29, and the SDMT could be integrated to video-consultation platforms or electronic health record systems, or be implemented using other online tools, such as Google Forms.\",\r\n        \"Limitations of tele-neurology include the availability of technology to deliver tele-consultations (e.g., webcam quality, high-speed connection), which need to be accounted for by policymakers to avoid healthcare inequalities.\",\r\n        \"In conclusion, though the medical management of COVID-19 is the current healthcare priority, chronic diseases should not be left unattended, and the use of common tools for neurological examination could improve tele-neurology practice, and quality of care for people with MS.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32440979/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04470-x\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7152917\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1016/j.gerinurse.2020.04.008\",\r\n    title:\r\n      \"Overcoming Speech and Language Disorders in Acute and Critical Care: 40 Years Later\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2020-04-13\",\r\n    authors: [\"Mary.Happ\", \"Jiwon.Shin\", \"Judith.Tate\"],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"],\r\n        generic: [\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"As our Geriatric Nursing anniversary year recognition continues, we are examining the topic of speech and language disorders in older adults during acute and critical illness and how attention to this topic has (or has not) changed in the past 40 years. In 1981, Geriatric Nursing published a classic, comprehensive overview of the assessment and treatment of speech and language disorders in older adults written by Barbara Dreher.1 “Overcoming Speech and Language Disorders”1 focused primarily on communication disorders resulting from stroke and laryngectomy. Several of the principles and interventions to improve communication presented in 1981 (e.g., modifying speaking and listening, maintaining quiet environment, and directions for the specific type of communication impairment) are still fundamental today in communication care for patients with stroke, and for a wide range of communication disabilities. Notably, the role of the speech language pathologist (SLP) in diagnosing and treating communication disorders was highlighted. Several communication tools such as communication boards with pictures, words, and letters and electronic voice synthesizers introduced in this article 40 years ago1 are still used for non-vocal patients in the acute care setting. We now have more advanced communication tools and nurse-led research testing the usability and efficacy of several of these tools.2\\n\",\r\n        \"Our understanding of the problems of communication disability, the conditions associated with impaired communication, and the health and safety risks of communication disability in the acute care of older adults increased tremendously over the past 40 years. Our view of communication disability expanded to include sensory impairments (i.e., poor vision or hearing) that affect receptive and expressive communication, limited English language proficiency, and poor health literacy. Similarly, attention to conditions beyond stroke that are associated with impaired communication include a host of neurocognitive (dementia) and neuromuscular (Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) disorders as well as situational conditions in acute and chronic critical illness (mechanical ventilation) that prevent vocal communication.\",\r\n        \"Over the past 40 years, we witnessed advancements in hearing aid technology, and advocacy for hearing assessment and hearing aid access for older adults. However, less than 20-25% of persons who may benefit from hearing amplification devices or hearing aids own them, largely due to stigma, cost and access barriers.3 Hearing amplification and the availability of amplification technology for hospitalized older adults who are hard-of hearing is still widely variable in acute care hospitals despite Joint Commission standards mandating hospitals to accommodate communication disability.4 Experts recently called for increased attention to and enforcement of the Joint Commission standards specific to hearing amplification during acute care hospitalization.4\\n\",\r\n        \"Missed communication and misinterpretation are recognized as patient safety issues for hospitalized adults as evidence shows that persons with communication disabilities have greater risk for preventable adverse events during hospitalization.5 The inability to access nurse call systems due to paralysis or weakness contributes to missed communication and is another form of communication impairment often experienced by hospitalized older adults, yet overlooked in care improvement initiatives. Zubow and Hurtig6 reported that 33% of conscious patients in intensive care units are unable to use the conventional nurse call systems to initiate communication of basic needs.\",\r\n        \"Our research and the work of colleagues in communication disorders science over the past four decades show that several common techniques that nurses rely on to communicate with nonvocal patients may contribute to misinterpretation of patient messages. For example, although many nurses rely on lip-reading to communicate with non-vocal patients, this technique requires formal training and is prone to misinterpretation.7 Nurses often assume that family members can interpret a patient's communication attempts during acute/critical illness, but family members report frustration and an inability to accurately interpret the patient's non-vocal messages.8 Communication impairment can affect symptom recognition by nurses and accurate pain assessment, in particular, can be problematic when patients have communication difficulty.9\\n,\\n10\\n\",\r\n        \"Multidisciplinary collaborations of communication disorders scientists, nurse researchers, and engineers led to improvements in low tech, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools (e.g., simple and complex communication boards, non-English language translations), clinician training in basic communication skills and AAC techniques, and electronic communication devices and tablet applications,2 including systems with nurse call features,11 for use in medical settings. A hospital chaplain developed and tested a novel spiritual care picture communication board, to support chaplain communication with non-vocal patients, showing an association between chaplain-led picture-guided spiritual care and reductions in anxiety and stress during and after an ICU admission. 12 Many older adults prefer low tech AAC tools, but are still able and interested in using electronic tablet communication applications for medical encounters with appropriate demonstration and instruction.13 These studies and initiatives also highlight and extend the role of the speech language pathologist in providing instruction, consultation and support for complex communication needs of acute and critically ill older adults.14\\n,\\n15\\n\",\r\n        \"Unfortunately, although AAC tools and trainings directed at the communication needs of acute and critically ill adults improved over the past 40 years, dissemination, implementation and uptake are quite slow. Barriers to widespread availability and competence in the use of AAC tools and techniques in acute and critical care include competing priorities, lack of knowledge, perceived time commitment, and a general lack of programmatic ownership in many institutions for the provision of communication support. Our colleagues across the country continue to report a lack of training on how best to communicate with communication-impaired patients, unavailability of communication supplies at the bedside, and underutilization of inpatient SLP services for communication support consultations.\",\r\n        \"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which disproportionately affects older adults in terms of severity and need for mechanical ventilation, sets an urgency to dissemination of communication materials and education and support for bedside providers.\",\r\n        \"Tragically, due to the isolation precautions necessary to prevent the spread of this devastating infection, family members are not able to attend at the bedside of patients with COVID-19. These critically ill patients and their family members are not able to benefit from patient-family centered communication interventions that could help them make sense of and process the critical illness event.16 ICU clinicians are required to fill the void. They need access to simple communication tools to quickly and reliably interpret COVID-19 patients’ messages.\",\r\n        \"In addition to being unable to communicate their needs and questions without voice, these mechanically ventilated patients may also have difficulty understanding instructions and messages from care providers who are wearing protective masks. A national group of experts created a suite of free communication tools, non-English translations, and tips https://www.patientprovidercommunication.org. The ‘case example’ tab provides exemplars of older adult patients with COVID19 to illustrate how speech language pathologists work with nurses to construct reliable methods to communicate with COVID-19 patients. They do this by observing from outside the isolation room, through iPad video connections, etc. The Ohio State University College of Nursing continuing education platform provides evidence-based communication training modules, brief demonstration videos, low-tech communication tools and a decision pathway for clinicians at https://go.osu.edu/speacs.\",\r\n        \"In summary, we know what to do and have some great tools and resources to provide comprehensive communication support to older adults with communication disability during acute and critical care hospitalization. However, these resources (e.g., hearing amplification, communication boards, writing tools, electronic devices, and SLP consultation) are not standardized or readily available in many acute care hospitals.

The chair of the negotiations on the revision of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR), 1 Mary Whelan, expressed doubt that consensus on the revisionswhich codified these changed expectations -would have been possible without the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Whelan, 2008, p. 5) , implying that the consensus remained a fragile one and the likelihood of compliance limited. Therefore, to understand whether there are new shared expectations about the prompt reporting of disease outbreaks and the extent to which these expectations have altered state behaviour, we need to examine behaviour in the immediate post-SARS setting. The aftermath of an event such as SARS is the perfect time to examine whether that sense of urgency generated by the crisis can be utilized to achieve long-term behavioural change (Whelan, 2008) . David Heymann (2006, p. 352) has argued that this behavioural change is already evident: 'the detection of, and international response to, the SARS outbreak clearly demonstrated that countries are willing to forgo the exclusive privilege of reporting and responding to infectious diseases occurring in their own territories in a manner over which they have supreme control'. He goes on to note that the East Asian response to Avian Influenza (AI), H5N1, which (re)appeared in December 2003 in poultry and went on to infect humans from 2004, 2 was indicative of a normative change where the duty to report prevailed over the financial and political costs of not doing so.\",\r\n        \"This article examines Heymann's claims in more detail. Did East Asian states, affected by H5N1 human infections in the immediate aftermath of SARS, satisfy expectations about their duty to report disease outbreaks promptly and transparently? The H5N1 outbreak is particularly interesting given that it emerged at a time when states were formalizing these new responsibilities in the revised IHR, which were then under negotiation (2004) (2005) and that some states affected by H5N1 -China and Vietnam especially -were still recovering from SARS when this outbreak occurred. What is of particular interest is the alternative suggestion to Heymann (2006) , which is that some degree of 'rebalancing' and reassertion of sovereignty occurred in the context of H5N1 in response to the overt interference of the WHO in domestic responses during SARS (Calain, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Hoffman, 2010) .\",\r\n        \"The article will proceed with a discussion of the post-SARS environment, and then examine how the International Relations (IR) literature has understood the events that followed during the H5N1 outbreak. I outline a common understanding that has emerged of the H5N1 outbreak, which suggests that East Asian states 'reverted to type' and reasserted their sovereignty by refusing to cooperate with disease reporting requirements. However, this interpretation is not based on an empirical assessment of how states actually behaved. To remedy this, I test the extent to which states engaged in 'frank and prompt reporting' (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) during the H5N1 outbreak. Doing so reveals that states did overwhelmingly meet this duty, even during the years when they were not legally bound to do so (which was not until the IHR revisions came into force in mid-2007) . I conclude that although sovereignty is undoubtedly an important influence on state behaviour, it need not be seen as antipathetic to states fulfilling their duty to report.\",\r\n        \"The SARS outbreak, which emanated from South China in early 2003, has been identified as the trigger for inspiring states to accept these new duties to report disease outbreaks (Heymann and Rodier, 2004) . However, even during the SARS outbreak, there was evidence of shared expectations about prompt reporting that led to international demands that the Chinese government engage in open and transparent reporting behaviour with neighbouring states and the wider international community, which was not at that point prescribed by international law (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . According to David Fidler (2004, p. 116) , expectations that China should report a disease outbreak not covered by existing international conventions revealed that the WHO and the wider international community had 'begun to move beyond the state centrism of Westphalian public health'.\",\r\n        \"However, even before SARS, states were progressively expecting new reporting behaviour. For instance, it has been argued that the WHO's response to SARS and states expectations during SARS were possible because of the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 54.14, agreed to in 2001 (Fidler, 2004, pp. 117-118) . WHA 54.14 (2001) was the first expression of an expectation that states had a duty to report outbreaks that could pose an international risk, and when they did not report an outbreak they expected the WHO to request for further information. This was dramatically new terrain for the WHO and for the states (Kamradt-Scott, 2010, p. 82), but the passing of this resolution arguably demonstrated states commitment to the concept even if the resolution itself was non-binding.\",\r\n        \"There is no doubt that SARS acted as the crucial 'tipping point' that galvanized states to accept the need for a new standard of reporting behaviour (Davies, 2011, p. 435) . However, this could not have occurred without the WHO's earlier efforts to promote new behaviours in the field of disease reporting and states acceptance of this need in 2001. During the SARS outbreak, a critical mass of support for the duty to report was again reached during the 2003 WHA. WHA Resolution 56.28 (2003) was unanimously passed, calling for completion of the revised IHR (1969) framework and draft regulations to be in place and ready for adoption by May 2005 WHA meeting (Whelan, 2008, p. 6 ). In the same resolution, it was noted that the as yet unrevised IHRs were 'inadequate' and failed to include specific actions required of member states and the WHO (WHA 56.28, 2003) . Member states thus agreed that even before the adoption of the IHR revisions, they would 'establish immediately a national standing task force or equivalent group and, within it, to designate an official or officials having operational responsibilities and accessible at all times by telephone or electronic communication, to ensure the speed, particularly during emergencies of both reporting to the WHO and consultation with national authorities when urgent decisions must be made' (WHA 56.28, 2003: Paragraph 3[2] ).\",\r\n        \"After SARS, the shared expectation that states would report openly and promptly was again reaffirmed. At the WHO Global Conference on SARS in June 2003, all states agreed that: 'Information should be communicated in a transparent, accurate and timely manner. SARS demonstrated the need for better risk communication as a component of outbreak control' (O'Malley et al, 2009, p. 614) . SARS was particularly exceptional because it exposed that a legal prescription for the duty to report was not the driving force required to change behaviour. SARS simply provided the 'critical mass moment' to turn that growing social expectation -states should report to each other openly and transparently -into prescribed practice (Davies 2011, p. 433) .\",\r\n        \"But how should we understand the emergence of this duty to report and what impact it has had on state behaviour? Why would states agree to a behavioural expectation that may be politically or economically costly? One view is that the risk of not reporting has become more risky for the sovereign than to openly report. Price- Smith (2009, pp. 143, 149) notes that China -the country most recalcitrant in reporting the extent of their SARS cases -was also the country that paid the highest economic and political cost. In other words, self-interested behaviour can remain the dominant norm for the sovereign state -but what defines self-interest is not static -it too changes through interaction with the wider social environment (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, p. 912 ). As such, constructivists have argued contra the neo-utilitarian view of liberal and realist perspectives that the evident readiness of states to agree to shared rules that constrain their behaviour demonstrates the degree to which global governance frameworks shape state identity, function and roles. In other words, 'a core constructivist research concern is what happens before the neo-utilitarian model kicks in' (Ruggie, 1998, p. 867, emphasis added) . In the area of health, the IR focus has been how to explain why the increase in global frameworks to address health concerns that were traditionally under the (confident) management of the state (Zacher and Keefe, 2008, p. 20) . One explanation is that the 'transition of public health governance on infectious diseases [for example] from the traditional Westphalian framework to something new y highlights changes that may be occurring to the general structure and dynamics of international relations in the era of globalization' (Fidler, 2004, p. 8) . This age of post-Westphalian global health governance has seen states socialized into cooperating in global governance frameworks and come to view such cooperation as serving their interests whether by resolving problems that cannot be resolving unilaterally or by reducing transaction costs through cooperation (Fidler, 2004) .\",\r\n        \"Under the leadership of the WHO Headquarters in the mid-late 1990s, initiatives such as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria achieved political and donor support that was relatively unprecedented (Lee et al, 2002; Ricci, 2009) . From this perspective, the IHR revisions were just one of the several recent examples of states agreeing to sacrifice portions of their sovereign privileges by committing themselves to comply with international standard setting. SARS simply 'changed the calculus of the material interests of member states to reflect the threat that disease posed to their material interests, resulting in rapid innovation and change of the existing regime' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154 ).In the case of the IHR revisions, three of its revised demands that are especially significant for enshrining the duty to report over the core interest of state sovereignty (Mack, 2006, p. 366) are: (i) the duty of the state to notify the WHO within 24 hours of any emergency that may constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); 3 (ii) the duty to contain the outbreak at its source; and (iii) the obligation of national authorities to respond to the WHO's request for further information (WHA 58.3, 2005: Articles 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12; Mack, 2006) .\",\r\n        \"Having briefly documented the emergence of the 'duty to report', the article now turns to examine the extent to which it has influenced the reporting behaviour of East Asian states affected by the H5N1 outbreak.\",\r\n        \"The H5N1 AI outbreak was first identified in poultry in East Asia in December 2003. The first cases of human infection with H5N1 were in 2004, with nearly all cases of human infection resulting from direct contact with poultry. 4 The concern with H5N1 in the early days, which somewhat remains, is that H5N1 AI virus 'remains one of the influenza viruses with pandemic potential, because it continues to circulate widely in some poultry populations, most humans likely have no immunity to it, and it can cause severe disease and death in humans' (WHO, 2011a) .\",\r\n        \"From 2003 to 2011, the highest cumulative total of human infections (and deaths) were (in order) in Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam (WHO, 2011b, see Table 1 ). The disease appeared to peak in 2006, when the highest number of human cases of infections appeared (most occurring in Indonesia). By 2010, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and China were the only countries to continue to experience human cases of infection (WHO, 2011b) .\",\r\n        \"H5N1 was first identified in poultry in South Korea in December 2003. In the same month, Thailand raised the alarm when the H5N1 virus strain was discovered in sick tigers and leopards in the Bangkok Zoo, which was traced to infected poultry being fed to the animals as the cause of their infection. Retrospective analysis in 2006 revealed that the first possible H5N1 poultry The international politics of disease reporting and human cases emerged from China in November 2003 (WHO, 2011c). This case was most likely confused for a SARS case (Schnur, 2006) .\",\r\n        \"In January 2004, Vietnam reported its first poultry outbreak of H5N1, followed in the same month by Japan, Hong Kong, Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Indonesia's first report of poultry cases came in February 2004, at the same time as mainland China reported its first poultry cases (WHO, 2011c). In January, Vietnam reported its first H5N1 human case. By February, there were fears that the disease had already adapted to human transmission when a cluster of cases from one family was identified in Vietnam in February 2004 (WHO, 2011c). In the same month, Thailand reported its first two human infections (direct from poultry). By the end of 2004, Vietnam and Thailand confirmed six and five human infection cases, respectively. By 2005, Cambodia, China and Indonesia had confirmed cases of H5N1 human infections. By the end of 2005, Indonesia had the highest human case load of infections with 20 cases (WHO, 2011c). To get a sense of how serious the potential threat was, it is worth noting that the fatality rate for humans infected with H5N1 was 73 per cent in 2004, 63 per cent in 2005 and 43 per cent in 2006. Moreover, 90 per cent of the cases were in people under the age of 40 years (WHO, 2006) .\",\r\n        \"At the outset of the H5N1 outbreak, there was no formal requirement for states to report and verify the disease because the revised IHR had not yet come into force (they did not do so until mid-2007). As the rate of infections The duty to report notwithstanding, there were several prima facie reasons to expect that states would not report H5N1 in a timely manner. First, states were not legally required to do so for the first three and a half years of the outbreak, as such governments might have been expected to comply only with their formal legal obligations (Lee and Fidler, 2007, p. 220) . Second, the financial costs associated with confirming H5N1 outbreak, especially the destruction of poultry stocks and associated farming livelihoods, posed a major deterrent to reporting (Scoones and Forster, 2010) . Third, these financial costs would also create additional political costs by devastating already vulnerable communities and placing intense pressure on governments to compensate and provide reassurances to save affected industries (Forster, 2010; Herington, 2010; Safman, 2010; Vu, 2010) . Despite these barriers, the literature has characterised the reporting behaviour of affected states as falling into one of the three categories: those that positively complied (Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia), those that did so more shakily (China, Thailand) and those that outwardly challenged the duty to report itself (Indonesia, Thailand). The general observation has been that the deterrents did not wholly inhibit reporting, but there were variations in how states understood their duty to report. Vietnam, Lao PDR and Cambodia were generally viewed as being positive, and presented as evidence of states embracing the need to engage in the global health governance framework to ensure greater assistance in identifying and preventing the outbreaks (de Sa et al, 2010) . When inevitable delays in reporting was noted in these countries, it was reported as being due to capacity failures rather than direct political intent to deceive the international community or domestic audiences about the extent of the outbreak (Boltz et al, 2006; Ear, 2010; Herington, 2010; Coker et al, 2011) .\",\r\n        \"At the same time, other states were criticized for their failure to adhere to the new duty to report, in particular prompt reporting and verification to the WHO of suspected outbreaks. In the second group, China's retrospective release of information in 2006-2007 for outbreaks in [2003] [2004] was met with some suspicion, with analysts asking whether these delays were the product of technical incapacity, bureaucratic difficulties or attempts at obfuscation (Chanlett-Avery et al, 2006, p. 10) . Thailand and Indonesia were regularly criticized for substantial lags in their initial reports of poultry and human cases, with it being revealed in both instances that the governments knew of the possible cause but delayed the release of laboratory findings (Butler, 2005; Butler, 2006; Sipress, 2009) . Thailand especially came under attack in the early stages of the outbreak.\",\r\n        \"The presence of large poultry industries in Thailand was especially identified as the possible cause of initial secrecy (Forster, 2010; Safman, 2010) .\",\r\n        \"However, the third behavioural category challenged the duty to report itself. Although the issue of virus sharing did not come under the auspices of the IHR (1969 or 2005 versions) , several analysts saw Indonesia's move as a broader bid to challenge its putative obligations under the revised IHR (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Smith, 2012) . Major concerns arose when Indonesia refused to share samples of the H5N1 virus from January 2007. Before this, it had been a long standing practice, as the creation of the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) under the WHO's management in 1951, for states to share their influenza virus strains with all WHO collaborating laboratories (located in selected national laboratories) to allow them to assist with the production of vaccines and monitoring of virus strain mutation. Indonesia's refusal to share strains via the GISN raised concerns about the potential for states to assert 'viral sovereignty' as a way of reasserting themselves in the face of global health governance (Holbrooke and Garrett, 2008; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009 , pp. 1386 -1387 .\",\r\n        \"The Indonesian Ministry of Health argued that it withheld the virus samples because virus sharing was unjust when the supplying country could not be guaranteed equitable access to vaccine and antiviral treatment from the developed countries that primarily manufactured these products on the basis of the viruses freely given (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Eighteen months later, in June 2008 (and a year after the IHR [2005] had come into force) then Indonesian Health Minister Dr Siti Fadilah Supari further questioned whether the government should even regularly report H5N1 human infections to the WHO (Branswell, 2008) . 5 Dr Supari's suggestion was seen as a significant challenge to the duty to report. However, in their written justification over the virus-sharing dispute, the Indonesian Ministry of Health did not refer to Dr Supari's comments regarding the IHR. The Ministry argued that their primary concern in terms of IHR reporting was the government's decision to conduct case confirmation within country rather than sending samples to a WHO collaborating laboratory for confirmation of diagnosis (Sedyaningsih et al, 2008) . Although the Ministry did apparently delay announcing some H5N1 human infections, particularly during 2009 where there are no details on such outbreaks on the WHO's Disease Outbreak News (DON) Website, the WHO Headquarters has continued to argue that it was promptly informed by the government of every outbreak during this period (Branswell, 2008 , Interview, 2011d . Indeed, the Indonesian government immediately supplied confirmation of two H5N1 human cases days after Dr Supari's comments (Reuters, 2008) . Nonetheless, Dr Supari's actions concerning virus samples and musings on the IHR gained support from other member states in the 'developed South' and particularly Asia sparking discussions about 'developing countries [being] increasingly suspicious' of the global health security initiative that inspired the IHR revisions (Aldis, 2008) . Moreover, although the Indonesian response during H5N1 was only one of three variants evident during the crisis, it is the one that has received most attention.\",\r\n        \"The culmination of these events during the H5N1 outbreak, particularly instances of delayed reporting by China and Thailand, and the virus sharing challenge by Indonesia, prompted some analysts to question the post-Westphalian optimism expressed in the introduction and immediately after SARS. Indeed, this view has come to include some notable earlier advocates of the post-Westphalian era (Fidler, 2010b) . It has been suggested that the arrival of a 'post-Wesphalian era' has been 'overstated' (Price- Smith, 2009, p. 154) , and shared expectations around the duty to report may not be sufficient to induce states to change their behaviour and that powerful countervailing sovereign interests will likely override the perceived duty to report (Hoffman, 2010, pp. 514, 519) .\",\r\n        \"Two principal sets of explanations were offered to explain this apparent backlash. The first concern was that the securitized rhetoric attached to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s had been accepted so readily that states were coming to view it as legitimate to (re)assert their sovereign right over their reporting behaviour, response and control of specimens. When disease outbreaks were associated with great economic costs -as was the case for Indonesia and other affected states -states were encouraged by securitization to respond through a security lens and privilege unilateral action over multilateral cooperation (Calain, 2007; Elbe, 2010; Forster, 2010 ; on costs see Coker et al, 2011) . As Stefan Elbe explained:\",\r\n        \"As fear about the threat of a possible human H5N1 pandemic spread across the world, many governments scrambled to stockpile anti-viral medications and vaccines, albeit in a context where there was insufficient global supply to meet such a rapid surge in demand. Realizing that they were the likely 'losers' in this international race, some developing countries began to openly question the benefits of maintaining existing forms of international health cooperation. (Elbe, 2010, p. 476) The second explanation was that 'WHO illustrated during the SARS crisis what leadership in global health looks like in a post-Westphalian world', that H5N1 reaffirmed that this had the potential to not just be an anomaly, and that this had prompted some states to respond by protecting their sovereignty from what they now viewed as a sustained attack (Stevenson and Cooper, 2009, p. 1390) . According to this line of thinking, the assertion of 'viral sovereignty' during H5N1, predominantly led by Indonesia but with the tacit support of the region (Fidler, 2010a, p. 288) , could be understood as a statement (predictable perhaps as noted by Smith, 2012 ) that states could question their duty to report to the WHO in the manner proscribed and expected. It has also been argued that the significance of WHA resolutions has been overstated. For example, WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) only called for states to 'voluntarily' comply with the revised IHR in their response to H5N1; regardless of the phrase adopted, WHA resolutions are not legally binding resolutions (Irwin, 2010, p. 9 ). The Indonesian-led opposition may also be interpreted as an inevitable backlash against what many saw as the WHO overstepping its role in 2003 during the SARS crisis (Cortell and Peterson, 2006) . From this perspective, the cooperation enjoyed during the SARS crisis was a product of exceptional circumstances and outside that context states would revert to type and seek to control outbreak news and manage their own response to outbreak events (Smith, 2010) .\",\r\n        \"There are, however, at least three problems with these dominant understandings of how East Asian states responded to the H5N1 outbreak. First, adherents to this line of thinking need to explain why sovereignty concerns seemed to matter more for some states than for others. As I noted earlier, Indonesia and Thailand are assumed to be more protective of their sovereignty than both Cambodia and Vietnam. Given regional similarities in their dispensations towards sovereignty and the fact that the latter countries have been subjected to conflict and external aggression in the past few decades, the norm of sovereign non-interference alone cannot explain the variance in their behaviour (Vu, 2011) . Second, too much weight is given to Dr Supari's comments and there is little evidence to suggest that they were part of a more concerted push against the duty to report or other global health governance norms. Supari's (speculative) comments were offered once in an interview given only 1 year before she stepped down as Health Minister. Beyond this, there is no other prima facie evidence that Indonesia proved more resistant to promptly reporting H5N1 outbreaks to the WHO authorities. Third, and crucial for establishing the second point, claims about the sovereignty backlash are made in the absence of empirical evidence about what states actually did in terms of their reporting behaviour of H5N1 human infections from 2004 to 2010. Establishing the reporting behaviour of H5N1 affected states over a sustained period of time, rather than providing selective snapshots, will go a long way to establishing whether states have in fact modified their behaviour in line with shared expectations about the prompt reporting of diseases.\",\r\n        \"This section examines the extent to which East Asian states complied with the duty to report by examining every report of H5N1 infection in the region between 2004 and 2010, noting not just official (government) confirmations of outbreaks, but the outbreak reports provided to the WHO by governments. Because of the variation in languages and different styles of reporting outbreaks via official Ministry of Health Websites (that is, some states report weekly or monthly, some report all immediate suspect outbreaks, some only report laboratory confirmed outbreaks), I examined the public communication of outbreak events by all states that recorded H5N1 human infections in the East Asian region between 2004 and 2010 via one disease monitoring website, ProMED Mail (PMM). 6 I then compared the reports for each case under PMM with the issuing of WHO alerts on the same outbreak that are usually released by the government for the WHO to then post on its DON site. 7 PMM is one of the oldest (created 1994) independent (non-state managed) publicly available International Surveillance and Response Programs, with a high correlation between its initial reports and event verification (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Hitchcock et al 2007) . It has strong moderator presence and access to subscribers who provide important insight into outbreak events that may have otherwise been overlooked if not for these 'insider informants' using PMM to communicate outbreak events (Madoff and Woodall, 2005; Brownstein et al, 2008) . Although the moderated service of PMM means that there is the potential for a report to be discarded because of the moderator believing it not to be relevant, or for a disease outbreak to be missed because the system does not use a text mining tool (that sifts news media source providers such as FACTIVA), PMM has been widely acknowledged as often pre-empting WHO receipt of reports, and accurately reporting outbreak events confirmed by the WHO (Madoff and Woodall, 2005, pp. 725-727; Conway et al, 2010) . 8 Table 2 details how the reports were identified and the countries for which reports were collected. I compared reports of H5N1 human infections on PMM with WHO receipt of reports, over a 6-year time span to indicate how states actually behaved in relation to the putative reporting duties. Within the PMM reports I noted whether there was a high volume of 'informal' reports or 'rumours' being circulated about any particular outbreak that was not confirmed by the government. The number of rumours per year per country were so low that I did not include this data. In sum, PMM reports detected nearly all outbreak reports attracted government response. Although the WHO DON site does not report all outbreaks reported to Headquarters (Interview, 2011a), here we may observe whether there is a general trend of governments reporting outbreaks to the WHO and to what extent states sought to comply with this new duty to report.\",\r\n        \"When the reporting behaviour was collated (see Figures 1-3) , it became clear that states were almost consistently maintaining the lead in reporting human outbreaks. Of particular interest, H5N1 reporting steadily increased after 2006, but just as crucially reporting rates to the WHO were highly correlated with official reports. This is of note considering that the IHR did not come into force until mid-2007, and as noted by others, prompt compliance with the IHR prompt reporting procedure was voluntary under WHA Resolution 59.2 (2006) at this time (Irwin, 2010) .\",\r\n        \"The core findings from my data set are threefold. First, Figure 1 demonstrates that the East Asian region had a steady reporting pattern that correlated closely with the number of cases in the region for that period, as shown in Figure 2 . In 2005 and 2006, the peak years for H5N1 human infection cases, affected governments were issuing regular updates of outbreaks. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the number of reports that the government were issuing and the confirmations by the WHO (which can only be publicly provided after receipt of government information). In 2005, there were only 10 official reports concerning outbreak events that were not published on the WHO Website -this is for all the three governments that had human infections that year (Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam). In 2006, there were only eight official reports released by the five governments that experienced outbreaks, which were not published on Vietnam. In addition, countries that did not have a case threshold of 5 or above were excluded (that is, Lao PDR, Myanmar); Cambodia was included due to regularly reporting for nearly all of the years examined. Finally, Bangladesh has reported human infection cases, but I have excluded them from this analysis due to case threshold. the WHO site. By 2008, the gap had narrowed to one official report that was either not sent on to the WHO, or the WHO opted not to publish on the DON site. Notably, in the light of the discussion in the previous section, this was in the same year that the Indonesian government -which accounts for the majority of cases in that year -discussed withholding reports. In sum, reports to the WHO were regular -both before the IHR coming into force and afterwards -and states always outpaced the WHO in their official reports of cases. There was only two instances (on 6 January 2005 and 16 June 2005) when the WHO reported on its DON site H5N1 outbreaks not yet confirmed by the state -Vietnam. Moreover, it appears that the mid-2007 date for when the IHR revisions came into force did not have any discernible effect on reporting, suggesting that the duty to report was in play before the IHR coming into formal effect. A second important finding is that those states critiqued for possible noncompliance with their duty to report -China, Indonesia and Thailand -were found to be reporting regularly. Of course, there are attendant questions surrounding the validity of the data and what it is actually telling us. Most notably, are states pre-empting media releases or controlling them (Davies, 2012) ? This is obviously very difficult to measure, but the possibility that reporting is largely controlled by the state should not be excluded. Nonetheless, it appears that the international attention attached to H5N1 cases led to a concerted effort by states to be seen as on the frontlines in response (Coker et al, 2011) .\",\r\n        \"The third important finding was the variation of state reporting behaviour beyond the graphs shown here. There were several important inconsistencies. Whereas Cambodia, China and Thailand released official reports that closely correlated with the WHO's confirmation of received reports from these countries (variation was no more than one case difference), Indonesia and Vietnam showed variation at different times. Indonesia had a strong reporting relationship with the WHO during the early phase of the outbreak. From 2007, variation started to emerge. In 2007, 5 reports were not passed on to WHO (or not reported), in 2008 there were 3, in 2009 there were 4 and then in 2010 there were 4 government reports that were again not published on WHO site. Both the WHO Office in Indonesia (who reports cases to the WHO Headquarters) and the Indonesian Health Ministry have argued that these discrepancies between what the Indonesian government was reporting and WHO site was listing as confirmed outbreaks was a product of the WHO Headquarters being informed but choosing not to publish the information (Interview, 2011c). A less official line expressed in a separate interview was that the WHO Office staff in Indonesia, during the public dispute with Dr Supari from 2006-2009 and prior to her stepping down, were always promptly informed but requested from 2008 that the WHO Headquarters not immediately publish all outbreak events online (Interview, 2011d) . What is remarkable about this less official explanation is that the Indonesian Health Ministry officials still sought to inform the WHO of outbreaks (possibly without the Health Minister's permission), even during the height of the dispute, and the Ministry officials appeared to trust the WHO officials sufficiently to continue reporting information it did not want publicized.\",\r\n        \"In the case of Vietnam, viewed as a 'positive' reporting case, the earlier phase of reporting from the government to the WHO was more sporadic -more than even at the height of the 'dispute' between Indonesia and the WHO. In 2005, the government reported 21 cases but the WHO issued only 12 reports. As noted earlier, two of these 12 reports were issued by the WHO without first confirming their existence from the government. From 2007 onwards, the correlation between the WHO and the government reports is almost identical, with only a difference of one case in some years. What is also very interesting about the Indonesia and Vietnam cases has been the strong emphasis in the literature that Indonesia's behaviour is a 'soverignty' or 'securitization' backlash; while Vietnam has been acquiesant. These findings reveal that even at the height of dispute between the WHO and Indonesian government reporting remained strong in comparison to the relationship between the WHO and Vietnam (viewed for the most part in positive terms). Despite significant differences between what Vietnam was obviously experiencing but not communicating to the WHO in the earlier years of the outbreak, there was little suspicion attached to this country's motivations. Whereas, the honesty of the Indonesian government was questioned, it seems, solely on the statements of the Health Minister in 2008. The lack of concern about Vietnam is all the more interesting given that the country's lack of freedom of the press means, in contrast with Indonesia's freer media structures, that there is little in the way of an informal reporting structure to keep the government 'accountable' (for example, Vu, 2010; Interview, 2011b; Davies 2012 ).\",\r\n        \"In the aftermath of SARS and the IHR (2005) revisions, the WHO Headquarters argued in the 2007 World Health Report that 'in an electronically transparent world where outbreaks are particularly newsworthy events, their concealment is no longer a viable option for governments' (WHO, 2007, p. 13) . In relation to the H5N1 human-to-human infections, which began in late 2003, it was argued that early behaviour indicated that states were willing to confirm outbreak reports and even report outbreaks themselves to the WHO -indicating a high level of norm internalization (Heymann, 2006, p. 352) . However, the virus sharing disagreement between Indonesia and the WHO Headquarters, the comments of Dr Supari and then the variations in reporting time frames (Enemark, 2007; Stevenson and Cooper, 2009; Elbe, 2010; Fidler, 2010b; Smith, 2010; Smith, 2012) prompted concern that statements such as the above by the WHO in their 2007 World Report were overly optimistic.\",\r\n        \"The question less explored in the literature is whether the normative expectation that states would report outbreaks promptly and transparently, as called for by the WHO, has actually been translated into behaviour. In this article, I have sought to show that for the case of H5N1 -notable for its immediacy post SARS and before the IHR revisions formally came into force -states in East Asia did appear to behave as if they believed themselves to be duty-bound to report promptly. Even those states that complained loudest about the WHO (Headquarters) assertiveness tended to report diseases regularly and promptly. When there were discrepancies (for example, Indonesia and Vietnam), they are minimal when their reporting pattern is viewed over the volume of cases across the six years. This section will now briefly examine how this compliance might be explained in the context of the post-Westphalian versus Westphalian argument.\",\r\n        \"Constructivist IR theory has traditionally understood the process by which norms shapes behaviour as one of 'norm diffusion' involving 'adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea' (Acharya, 2004, p. 251) . However, as the field's critique of global health governance has noted, neither the East Asian region nor the international community appear to have bought wholesale into the idea that in every instance the IHR must be obeyed, especially if at the expense of other national interests (Katz and Fischer, 2010) . A more nuanced analysis is therefore called for. Amitav Acharya argues that when tracing normative change we should not just stop at the point that the norm is collectively accepted but should consider how the norm is 'localized'.\",\r\n        \"According to Acharya (2009, p. 19) , norm localization 'does not extinguish the cognitive prior or identity of the norm-takers but leads to its mutual inflection with external norms. In constructivist perspectives on socialization, norm diffusion is the result of adaptive behaviour in which local practices are made consistent with an external idea. Localization, by contrast, describes a process in which external ideas are adapted to meet local practices'. The trajectory for localization, according to Acharya, progresses in four stages (Table 3) .\",\r\n        \"What my findings have revealed is that given the conformity to the reporting norm during the H5N1 outbreak in East Asia, the duty to promptly report Table 3 : Trajectory of localization (based on Acharya, 2004, p. 251) Prelocalization\",\r\n        \"Local actors may at first resist an external norm -either due to doubts of utility, adaptability or that it might undermine existing beliefs and practices. Therefore, it is vital that some aspect of the existing norm is found to have not adequately met 'new and unforeseen challenges'\",\r\n        \"Local initiative At this stage, some local actors will start to borrow and frame the external norm to suit the local audience. Local actors must be 'willing and credible' -they cannot be seen as representing the wishes of an outside force Adaptation External norm will be 'reconstructed' to fit local beliefs and practices and likewise, local beliefs and practices will be adjusted to the behaviour required of the external norm Amplification Finally, there are new instruments and practices developed from the 'syncretic normative framework' -where local practices and influences are still visible, but the presence of the external norm is now visible disease outbreaks is best understood as being at the 'local initiative' stage where local actors are 'willing and credible' participants in the disease reporting framework but the process of adaptation and amplification are still nascent. Sovereignty has not been evoked to deny the duty to report nor has it led to states abrogating their perceived duty. Instead, East Asian states have demonstrated a strong interest in being seen as competent handlers of the outbreak, partly because of external funding attached to pandemic response and partly because of political interest in responding to an outbreak that was crippling poultry industries around the region (Coker et al, 2011) . Meanwhile, China was later commended for being remarkably cooperative in reporting H5N1 cases to the WHO, many think precisely because of its embarrassment after SARS (Interview, 2010; Interview, 2011a) . This is consistent with Acharya's local initiative stage where states are cognizant of local expectations regarding handling of outbreak events as much as they are of the international community's demands and norms (Harrington, 2010; Elbe, 2010) .\",\r\n        \"However, as Figure 3 and my third point regarding state reporting behaviour above point out, there were inconsistencies. The question is whether these inconsistencies illustrate a failure to reconstruct the external norm, resulting in reassertions of sovereignty, or whether they were simply products of states interpreting the norm and adapting it to their context and circumstance (Davies, 2011) . For instance, Dr Supari's comments and actions regarding virus sharing did not alter the actual reporting relationship between the WHO Headquarters and Indonesian Health Ministry. Even though Figure 3 appears to show the Indonesian government not passing its reports on to the WHO, we know from reports that outbreak information was shared (Reuters, 2008) . Interviews with key stakeholders from the Indonesian government, the WHO Office in Jakarta and the WHO Headquarters (Interview, 2008; Interview, 2011a; Interview, 2011c; Interview, 2011d) 9 have confirmed that officials-level practice of reporting and verifying was not affected by the political debates about virus sharing and reporting. Political sensitivity amended how the reports were communicated, but the reporting relationship remained intact. The 'international' duty to report was amended to reflect local needs and priorities, but it was not breached. The same explanation has been expressed regarding earlier discrepancies between Vietnam's official reports and the WHO's reports of H5N1 (Interview, 2011b). Moreover, in the case of Vietnam and Indonesia, some delays in reporting appeared to be largely rooted in difficulty communicating outbreaks via decentralized health channels and poorly equipped laboratories outside of capitals (Forster, 2010; Vu, 2010) . It is of note that IR appreciations of the H5N1 case have emphasized sovereign obfuscation over sovereign capacity to meet the duty to report for explaining state behaviour during H5N1 (Davies, 2011) .\",\r\n        \"Do these findings suggest that the post-Westphalians were right all along? Not yet. While the graphs demonstrate that the desire to internalize the norm to report promptly and openly is evident in the region, if we understand Archya's argument concerning how norms are localized -particularly in the Asian context -there are crucial adaption and syncretic hurdles to be jumped. In other words, the way in which this duty is interpreted and implemented will depend on how it is affected by resource constraints, political systems, political instabilities, natural disasters and crises, and other cherished principles. All of this creates the potential for backtracking when circumstances persuade states that non-compliance would serve them better than compliance. These circumstances were apparent during the course of the H5N1 outbreak but more often than not the duty to report was fulfilled, if imperfectly.\",\r\n        \"The H5N1 crisis showed that states acted as if they had a duty to promptly report disease outbreaks. Sovereignty was not employed as an excuse to avoid compliance by failing to report. As noted by one health official, 'we are a competitive group in ASEAN, if we can't be seen to be doing the right thing in front of our neighbours y that is worse than anything WHO can say' (Interview, 2011e). Amitav Acharya (2009, p. 5) has noted in the case of Asia, 'new international norms do not enter into a local normative vacuum'. Sometimes new norms can amplify local norms or be made to fit local norms with some form of normative compromise. This normative compromise is evident in the region in relation to the duty to report. Of course, in East Asia, sovereignty and non-interference remain sacrosanct, but the way in which these principles are understood is changing to permit some degree of sovereign responsibility (Bellamy and Davies, 2009 ). Moreover, sovereignty and noninterference have never meant that member states do not need to be aware of the impact of their domestic political actions on each other (Acharya, 2009) .\",\r\n        \"The response to H5N1 may therefore have been as much about responding to regional demands for notification as it was to responding to the WHO's demands. One example of this that is having great success in the region but receives little discussion within IR circles has been the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) that is now in its second phase (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The purpose of APSED, which includes member states to the WHO South East Asia Regional Office and the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office, with the engagement of the ASEAN Secretariat, is to promote regional understandings and interpretation of the IHR revisions, regional understandings of how responsible states engage in disease outbreak surveillance, response and communication (Li and Kasai, 2011) .\",\r\n        \"In sum, claims that there has been a sovereignty backlash against the duty to report diseases and that this is forestalling progress on global health governance only reflect part of the picture. Of course, sovereignty and politics play important roles but it is important to understand the extent to which behaviour is actually shaped and to do so on the basis of empirical evidence of what that behaviour actually is. Evidence from H5N1 suggests that concerns notwithstanding East Asian states do behave as if they believe themselves to have a duty to report. The source of this change is most probably a combination of global norms, institutional standard setting, self-interest and -importantlyregional peer pressure.\",\r\n        \"human-to-human transfer

HSA enhances the integrity by electrostatic binding to the negatively charged heparin sulfate side chains of core glycoproteins such as syndecan-1 and glypican-1 of the endothelial glycocalyx via its positively charged arginine residues and enhances the availability of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by red blood cells (RBCs). Extracellular sphingosine is taken up and phosphorylated by RBCs sphingosine kinases (SK) into S1P that is stored in the cell membrane of RBC. S1P is extracted from the RBC membrane by Apo lipoprotein M (ApoM) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Apo lipoprotein M is the principal partner of S1P in HDL) and HSA, and this ensures a constant supply of receptor-available S1P for cellular signaling purposes. In contrast to the bond formed between S1P and HDL, HSA facilitates the solubility of S1P in the aqueous solution but not in physical bond to HSA. This unbound S1P is the active form of S1P. It is worth mentioning that one S1P molecule is extracted by 500 serum albumin molecules, indicating that HSA does not physically bind S1P [7–9]. S1P activates the G protein-coupled S1P1 receptor, which rapidly activates the Rho family small GTPase Rac1 in the endothelial cells, leading to peripheral localization of cytoskeletal effectors (cortactin and nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase). This localization promotes adherents’ junction (including vascular endothelial-cadherin and associated catenins) and tight junction (occluding, zonula occludens proteins and claudins) formation. Therefore, S1P improves the vascular barrier and stabilizes the endothelial glycocalyx. S1P has been found to reduce matrix metalloproteinase activation, thereby attenuating the loss of endothelial cell surface glycocalyx components. Both actions appear to involve signaling via the S1P receptor [10].\",\r\n        \"Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in pro-oxidant and antioxidant balance leading to damage of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. According to Halliwell and Whiteman, an antioxidant is a substance that, when present at low concentrations compared with those of an oxidizable substrate, significantly delays or prevents oxidation of that substrate [11]. Human serum albumin represents a major antioxidant agent in human plasma. The antioxidant activity of HAS results from the redox properties of the Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) and from metal-binding abilities. Among the metal ligands, copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are very important, as they are able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) after a reaction with oxygen. Free Cu (I) and Fe (II) ions can react with H2O2 leading to the formation of the deleterious hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. Cu(I) and Fe(II) binding to HSA promotes their oxidation to Cu(II) and Fe (III), thereby limiting their ability to participate in Fenton reaction. Copper ions bind to HSA with high affinity at the N-terminal tripeptide Asp-Ala-His. The first four amino acids of the N-terminus of HSA, Asp-Ala-His-Lys (DAHK), form a tight binding site for Cu(II) ions. DAHK/Cu has a superoxide dismutase activity, which thereby reduces the ROS generation. By trapping Cu(II), HSA prevents low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid peroxidation. Moreover, HSA and the tetrapeptide (DAHK) were shown to prevent neuronal death in murine cell cultures exposed to oxidative stress generated by H2O2/Cu(I)/ascorbic acid reagent [12]. Therefore, the binding of Cu ions with albumin is considered one of the most important antioxidant functions of albumin as Cu can react with H2O2 to hydroxyl radicals 60 times faster than Fe.\",\r\n        \"HSA is important for heme-Fe scavenging, providing protection against free heme-Fe oxidative damage. During the first seconds after heme-Fe appearance in plasma, more than 80 % of this powerful oxidizer binds to HDL and LDL, and only the remaining 20 % binds to HSA and hemopexin (HPX). Then, HSA and HPX remove most of the heme-Fe from HDL and LDL. Afterward, heme-Fe transits from HSA to HPX, which releases it into hepatic parenchymal cells after internalization of the HPX-heme-Fe complex by CD91 receptor-mediated endocytosis. It should be mentioned that kinetics of heme-Fe transfer from HDL and LDL to HSA and HPX is faster than the heme-Fe-induced lipoprotein oxidation [13, 14].\",\r\n        \"Albumin-bound bilirubin confers an antioxidant effect by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Bilirubin bound to albumin was shown to protect α(alpha)-tocopherol from damage mediated by peroxyl radicals and to prolong the survival of human ventricular myocytes against in situ–generated oxidative stress [15, 16]. Cholesterol undergoes oxidation in vitro and in vivo, forming biologically active derivatives known as oxysterols. Oxysterols bind to albumin with high affinity. Oxysterols carried by albumin are less rapidly released to cells than cholesterol. By this, albumin could limit detrimental effects of oxysterols on cells. Furthermore, binding homocysteine by HSA protects from atherosclerosis as elevated plasma homocysteine is a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Figs. 9.2 and 9.3) [17].\\n\\n\",\r\n        \"Physiologically, HAS exists predominately in a reduced form (i.e., with free thiol, HSA-SH) and is known as mercapto-albumin. However, a small but significant proportion of albumin pool exists as mixed disulfides (HSA-S-S-R); where R represents low-molecular-weight, thiol-containing substances in plasma – chiefly cysteine and glutathione [18]. Mixed disulfide formation increases as part of the aging process and during disease processes characterized by oxidative stress that enhances endothelial cell damage through oxidative stress and increase in apoptosis levels. Cysteine 34 (Cys 34) represents the largest fraction of free thiol in human plasma, HAS being the most abundant protein in plasma. Cys34 is located at the surface of HAS, close to Aspartate 38 (Asp38), Histidine 39 (His39), and Tyrosine 84 (Tyr 84). These three residues affect the ionization state of Cys34, thus modulating its reactivity [13]. In healthy adults, about 70–80 % of the Cys34 in albumin contains a free sulfhydryl group, whereas about 25–30 % of the HSA molecules have Cys34 forming a mixed disulfide with either cysteine or homocysteine or glutathione, thus affecting the Cys34 redox potential. Oxidation of Cys34 leads to the formation of sulfenic acid (RSOH), which is further oxidized to sulfinic (RSO2 H) or sulfonic acid form (RSO3 H). Sulfenic acid constitutes a central intermediate in both the reversible and irreversible redox modulation by reactive species. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) constitute nitrogen-centered species analogous to ROS. RNS such as nitric acid (NO) contribute to various biological processes. HSA acts as a NO depot and a NO transducer. Moreover, 82 % of NO in blood (~7 μ[mu] M) is transported as an S-nitrosothiol bound at the HSA residue Cys34. S-nitrosylated HSA may represent a circulating endogenous reservoir of NO and may act as an NO donor. S-nitrosylated HSA acts primarily as a vasodilator in vivo and represents a stable reservoir of NO that can be released when the concentrations of low-molecular-weight thiols are elevated [19]. S-nitrosylated HSA has been shown to reduce either ischemia or reperfusion injury in pig and rabbit hearts after unprotected warm ischemia through long-lasting release of NO [13]. Other RNS, such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−), constitute powerful oxidants and nitrating species [20]. The -SH group of albumin represents an important antioxidant against peroxynitrite as the thiol group was oxidized to a sulfenic acid (HSA-SOH). Subsequently, HSA-SOH can be converted to a disulfide and then back to mercapto-albumin (HSA-SH). HSA administration favorably influences plasma thiol-dependent antioxidant status, as well as levels of protein oxidative damage in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [21, 22]. Moreover, HSA is able to scavenge strongly oxidant compounds such as hypochlorous acid (HOCI) and hypothiocyanous acid. Cys34 is oxidized preferentially by hypochlorous and hypothiocyanous acid with the corresponding sulfenyl derivative. HSA is able to scavenge HOCI, preventing alteration of its preferential biological target α(alpha)1-antiprotease [23]. Interestingly, West Nile virus is neutralized by hypochlorous acid-modified HSA that binds to domain III of the viral envelope protein E [24].\",\r\n        \"During its long life (~3 weeks), an HSA molecule makes 15,000 passes through the circulation, incurring some damages that affect its ligand-binding and antioxidant properties. Diabetes mellitus is one of the main pathological conditions that impairs the antioxidant functions of albumin. In this disease, albumin undergoes increased glycation. The level of glycated HSA in normal humans is about 10 %, and increased to 20–30 % in hyperglycemic patients. Glycation corresponds to the nonenzymatic attachment of glucose molecule to a free amine residue. HSA glycation is associated with oxidation of His and Trp residues, main chain fragmentation, and loss of both secondary and tertiary structure. Both the use of diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and aspirin reduces the levels of advanced glycation [25]. The glycation of HSA impairs its antioxidant activity and its copper-binding ability. Glycation of HSA induced a marked loss of its antioxidant activity to copper-mediated oxidation of LDL, probably by the generation of superoxide. Moreover, the Fe(III)-binding antioxidant capacity of HSA is markedly reduced in diabetic patients. Finally, the HSA transport of tryptophan (Trp), which is the largest and essential amino acid, is reduced after its glycation. HSA glycation alters the binding of endogenous and exogenous ligands; in particular, glycation of Lys 199 enhances warfarin binding, but decreases bilirubin affinity [13].\",\r\n        \"Several receptors for advanced glycation end products initiate intracellular signaling and enhance ROS formation in the cells through recognition and binding of glycated (macro) molecules including HSA. Moreover, hypochlorous acid-mediated carbonylation of Lys residues of glycated HSA represents a major antigenic advanced glycation end product in hyperglycemia and in inflammation [26]. Glycated albumin was shown to impair vascular endothelial NO synthase activity in vivo in aortas of rabbits [27]. Glycated HSA displays a toxic effect on microglial cells associated with impairments in cellular proteolytic systems, possibly reflecting the role of advanced glycation end products in neurodegenation.\",\r\n        \"HSA may protect other proteins including hemoglobin, insulin, and immunoglobin from glycation in the early stages of diabetes due to its long half-life and its high concentrations compared to other proteins [28]. The irreversible damages associated with diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and coronary artery disease could be attributed to reduced antioxidant properties of glycated HSA.\",\r\n        \"Alterations in antioxidant properties of HSA were very recently identified in vivo in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This reflects the impaired antioxidant HSA activity, which is associated with the enhanced glycation level of HSA in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. That might have increased the perioperative risks in those patients [29].\",\r\n        \"HSA has anticoagulant and antithrombotic functions. These functions may in part be mediated by the HSA capacity to bind NO forming S-nitrosothiols, thereby inhibiting the rapid inactivation of NO and allowing prolongation of its anti-aggregatory effects on platelets [30]. Therefore, the use of HSA might be very beneficial in cases with hypercoagulable conditions such as during the perioperative period.\",\r\n        \"The interaction between HSA and another molecule results in enzymatic activity. This property of HSA is called an enzyme-like or a pseudo-enzymatic activity. The esterase activity involving lysine (Lys) 199 is able to split acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) into salicylic acid, which is released and the acetyl group is transferred to especially Lys 199. Therefore, aspirin but not other salicylates induce the aspirin resistance syndrome, as the acetylation of albumin molecule can be allergic. Asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps characterize aspirin resistance syndrome. Moreover, Lys 199 and penicillins can covalently bind via an aminolysis, generating a penicilloyl-containing peptide. The covalent labeling of Lys 199 can have clinical consequences. The penicilloyl-HSA complex has no antibacterial activity; however, it represents the major antigenic determinant of penicillin allergy. HSA acts as a phosphotriesterase activity, which thereby inactivates organophosphorus compounds. HSA can catalyze RNA phosphodiester bond cleavage; therefore, it participates in the degradation of endogenous extracellular RNA and of circulating pathogenic nucleic acids. HSA possesses enolase activity toward dihydrotestosterone, converting it from the 3-keto to the 3-enol form. In addition, HSA facilitates the isomerization and the stereoselective hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates and the removal of glucuronide conjugates, thereby reducing their plasma levels by reversible and/or irreversible binding. Finally, HSA seems to have a significant role in both the biosynthesis and the elimination the prostaglandins. HSA has no enzymatic effects on leukotrienes or thromboxanes. However, it binds and thereby stabilizes thromboxane A2. Binding could play a major role for the inactivation of these potent compounds, diminishing the biological activities of substances that may be harmful for the body if present in too large amounts [6, 13].\",\r\n        \"Hypoalbuminemia is generally defined as serum albumin concentration ≤30 g/L and is usually very common in critically ill patients. The albuminemia could result from increased loss of HSA into the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and reduced hepatic synthesis of HSA caused by cytokines and stress of critical illness.\",\r\n        \"Hypoalbuminemia is considered an independent risk factor for worse outcomes in critically ill patients. HSA levels <20 g/L were associated with higher mortality risk in burn patients with 84 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity [31]. In surgical septic patients, every 1 g/L decrease in albumin below 23 g/L was associated with a 19.4 % increase in hospital mortality and 28.7 % increase in the incidence of multiple organ failure [32]. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/L in serum albumin was associated with a 137 % increase in morbidity, and a 71 % increase in length of hospital stay [33]. Preoperative low serum albumin (<4.0 g/dl) was shown to be an independent risk factor for acute kidney injury (AKI) following off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB). AKI was associated with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital and a high mortality rate [34].\",\r\n        \"HSA circulates from the blood across the capillary wall into the interstitial compartments, including cerebrospinal fluid, and returns to the blood through the lymphatic system with a circulation half-life of approximately 16 h. The movement of HSA across the capillary wall is defined as the transcapillary escape rate (5 % per hour), which indicates the percentage of intravascular HSA leaving the intravascular compartment per hour [13]. In its long half-life of ~2–3 weeks, 1 HSA molecule could make about 15,000 passes through the circulation. HSA is mainly synthesized in the liver. In healthy young adults, about 12–25 g of HSA per day is synthesized in polysomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. HSA is not stored hepatically and there is therefore no reserve for release on demand [30]. Under physiological circumstances, only 20–30 % of hepatocytes produce HSA and its synthesis can be increased up to 200–300 % on demand. HSA synthesis is regulated by colloid osmotic pressure and the osmolality of the interstitial liquid around the hepatocytes. Insulin plays an important role in stimulating HSA synthesis; therefore, diabetic patients could suffer hypoalbuminemia. Estrogens do not affect HSA transcription, but act by modifying the stability of the HSA mRNA. HSA synthesis can be enhanced by corticosteroids, insulin, and amino acids administration. HSA synthesis can be rate-limited by amino acid deficiencies, but these are rarely seen clinically, except in states of extreme starvation and malnutrition [30]. In acute-phase reactions, such as in trauma and the perioperative period, the synthesis of HSA is depressed by hepatic cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α(alpha).\",\r\n        \"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and albumin, despite their disparate forms and functions, have long been known to share two unique characteristics, namely, their lengthy life spans and inverse relationship between their serum concentrations and half-lives. The long half-lives are attributed to the efficient receptor-mediated recycling pathway involving the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is a heterodimer of a nonclassical major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) α(alpha)-chain and β(beta)2 microglobulin (β[beta]2m) that binds the two abundant serum proteins IgG and albumin in the body. FcRn binds both IgG and albumin simultaneously on the opposite sides of the receptor, where the net transport can be basolateral to apical, apical to basolateral, or apical to apical (endothelial cells). FcRn interacts with IgG and albumin in a strictly pH-dependent manner; therefore, it binds them at acidic pH and not at physiological pH. Pinocytosed IgG and albumin bound by the receptor within acidified endosomes are transported back to the cell surface where physiological pH of the blood triggers release of the ligands into the blood circulation. The intracellular nonbound fractions are targeted for lysosomal degradation. FcRn is also largely responsible for transporting the IgG across the placenta whereby the IgG concentration in newborns at term normally exceeds that of the mother. Animals deficient in FcRn catabolize IgG and albumin more rapidly than normal animals and manifest low plasma concentrations of both molecules. Familial hypercatabolic hyoproteinemia, where deficiency of FcRn is due to mutation in β (beta) 2m results in hypercatabolism and low plasma concentrations of both albumin and IgG. However, patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) exhibit plasma deficiency only in IgG but not albumin caused by reduced affinity of FcRn to IgG [35–37].\",\r\n        \"The catabolism of HSA takes place in several organs at a rate of about 14 g per day in a 70 kg healthy adult, or 4 % of whole body protein turnover. The rate of HAS catabolism is increased by protein and caloric deprivation as HSA is used as a source of energy. The mechanism of HSA breakdown involves protein uptake into endocytotic vesicles, which fuse with lysosomes of endothelial cells.\",\r\n        \"Circulating HSA is also lost into the intestinal tract (about 1 g each day), where digestion releases amino acids and peptides that are reabsorbed. There is minimal urinary loss of HSA in healthy subjects. It is worth mentioning that of the 70 kg of HSA that passes through the kidneys each day, only a few milligrams are secreted from kidney tubules [13].\",\r\n        \"The use of human albumin in critically ill and septic patients has been through much controversy in the last two decades. In 1998, a Cochrane meta-analysis for albumin administration in critically ill patients was published in the British Medical Journal [38]. The average sample size of the selected 32 studies in this meta-analysis was just 46 patients. The results of this meta-analysis showed increased mortality of almost 70 % in patients given albumin. The results of this Cochrane report changed the practice rapidly around the world with dramatic reduction in albumin use especially in Europe. The validity of this meta-analysis has been disputed for several methodological reasons, such as omission of relevant trials, small trials bias, and combination of heterogeneous trials, which included adults and high-risk neonates, inadequate assessment of the effect of methodological quality on outcome, and the absence of a plausible mechanism to explain albumin-associated excess mortality [39, 40]. Moreover, the meta-analysis did not include burns trials in which the mortality rate was lower in albumin [41]. Finally, the crossover pattern in which the most seriously ill patients in the control group were switched to albumin as a rescue measure, therefore, would bias the pooled estimates of relative risk in favor of the control group [40]. Only a few years later, this meta-analysis was followed by an updated meta-analysis, in which 55 trials involving 3,504 randomly assigned patients had been included and 525 deaths occurred [40]. Pooled relative risk estimates among trials with blinding and those with 100 or more patients were 0.73 (CI, 0.48–1.12) and 0.94 (CI 0.77–1.14), respectively. The relative risk was also consistently less than 1.0 for trials that had two or more of the four attributes indicating higher methodological quality such as blinding, mortality as an endpoint, no crossover, and 100 or more patients. These observations suggest that albumin therapy reduces mortality. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis supported the safety of albumin use in critically ill patients. In 2004, the results of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) randomized control trial (RCT) in 7,000 critically ill patients were published, showing that a 4 % albumin solution was as safe as normal saline as resuscitative fluid in critically ill patients [42]. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis of the SAFE study showed benefit of using albumin in patients with severe sepsis, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for death of 0.71 (95 % CI, 0.52–0.97; P = 0.03) for albumin compared with saline. Therefore, the authors concluded that administration of albumin compared to saline did not impair renal function or organ function and may have decreased the risk of death in patients with severe sepsis [1].\",\r\n        \"Moreover, Guidet and colleagues assessed the cost-effectiveness of albumin, as given in the SAFE study on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, who were admitted to 1 of 35 French ICUs. Based on a presumed 4.6 % reduction in mortality associated with albumin therapy as shown in the SAFE trial, 513 lives were saved among the 11,137 patients included, with an estimated life expectancy for each life saved of 9.8 years. Therefore, the authors suggested that albumin administration was a cost-effective intervention in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [4].\",\r\n        \"In a subsequent meta-analysis that included 17 studies with randomized 1,977 participants, there were eight studies that included only patients with sepsis and where patients were a subgroup of the study population. The use of albumin for resuscitation of patients with sepsis was associated with a reduced mortality, with the odds ratio of 0.82 % (CI 95 % 0.67–1.0, P = .047) [1]. Caironi and colleagues randomized 1,818 patients with severe sepsis in 100 ICUs to receive either 20 % albumin and crystalloid solution or crystalloid solution alone. During the first 7 days, patients in the albumin group had a higher mean arterial pressure and lower net fluid balance (P < 0.001). At 28 days the mortality rate was 31.8 % in the albumin group and 32.0 % in the crystalloid group. At 90 days the mortality rate was 41.1 % in the albumin group and 43.6 % in the crystalloid group. However, there was improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock (1,121 patients; 90-day mortality, 43.6 % in the albumin group vs. 49.9 % in the crystalloid group; relative risk 0.87; 95 % CI, 0.77–0.99; P = 0.03) [43]. The results of a recent meta-analysis, which included 14 studies (18,916 patients with sepsis), showed that resuscitation with balanced crystalloids or albumin in patients with sepsis seems to be associated with reduced mortality [44]. Furthermore, the improved survival associated with albumin in patients with septic shock was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, 3,658 with severe sepsis and 2,180 with septic shock patients were included in the analysis [45]. Compared with crystalloid, a trend toward reduced 90-day mortality was observed in severe sepsis patients resuscitated with albumin (OR 0.88; 95 % CI, 0.76–1.01; P = 0.08). However, in septic shock patients the use of albumin for resuscitation significantly decreased 90-day mortality (OR 0.81; 95 % CI, 0.67–0.97; P = 0.03) [45].\",\r\n        \"Albumin resuscitation in sepsis has a unique feature compared to crystalloid as its effectiveness as a plasma-volume expander does not change in pathophysiological conditions associated with increased microvascular permeability as sepsis. In addition, in severe sepsis the ratio of albumin to crystalloid for equal plasma volume expansion is approximately 1–4.5 [46]. The use of intravenous albumin in addition to antibiotics in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis reduced the incidence of renal impairment, death, and paracentesis-induced circulatory collapse in comparison with treatment with an antibiotic alone [47, 48]. In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of albumin improved oxygenation but did not affect mortality [49].\",\r\n        \"The only exception for the benefit of using albumin in patients with sepsis was shown in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial as evidenced in increasing mortality with the use of albumin and saline boluses compared to no bolus (control group) in pediatric patients infected with malaria in eastern African countries. The bolus-therapy-induced hypervolemia by albumin and saline boluses in those patients could explain the increased mortality in this study compared to control group [50].\",\r\n        \"Human serum albumin is a unique pleiotropic protein with neuroprotective properties. Rats received 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and were treated with human albumin or saline after 30 min of recirculation. The cortical blood vessels were examined afterward by laser-Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI). Albumin therapy resulted in significant increases in arteriolar diameter, and reversing stagnation, thrombosis, and corpuscular adherence within cortical venules in the reperfusion phase after focal ischemia [51]. In a rat model of acute ischemic stroke induced by MCAO, rats received 1.25 g/kg intravenously at 2, 3, 4, or 5 h after onset of MCAO. Albumin therapy markedly improved neurological function, and reduced infarction volume and brain swelling [51]. The neuroprotective effects of albumin have been confirmed in a study with permanent MCAO in rats, where albumin treatment led to 48 % increases in cortical perfusion (P < 0.002), but saline in the control group caused no change [51].\",\r\n        \"Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess the albumin treatment during stroke recovery in rats. Albumin treatment was associated with restoration of fMRI response magnitudes and temporal profiles [52]. Rats underwent subarachnoid hemorrhage by endovascular perforation. Albumin of either 0.63 or 1.25 g/kg was injected immediately after the surgery. Albumin at low-to-moderate doses markedly improves long-term neurobehavioral sequelae after subarachnoid hemorrhage [53].\",\r\n        \"There are only two large published trials for the use of albumin after acute ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group multicenter trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), 422 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 % albumin (2 g [8 ml] per kg; maximum 750 ml) and 419 to receive an equivalent volume of isotonic saline. The primary outcome was favorable, defined as either a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1, or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, or both, at 90 days. The rate of favorable outcome did not differ between the groups. However, the patients in the albumin group had more mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [54]. The reason for the negative outcome of this well-designed study was the high dose of albumin given as a single bolus, which might have induced those unfavorable effects and obscured the neuroprotective effect of albumin.\",\r\n        \"Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days was tolerated by the patients with SAH without major complications and may be neuroprotective. Albumin in the dose of 1.25 g/kg/day/7 days had lower rates of cerebral vasospasm measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and cerebral infarctions. The main physiological effects of albumin treatment were elevation of the serum albumin concentration and mean arterial blood pressure. In addition, serum albumin remained elevated 7 days after treatment, which might be beneficial throughout the critical period of DCI [55, 56].\",\r\n        \"The mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of albumin could be explained by its ability to attenuate brain edema and inhibit the endothelia cell apoptosis [57, 58]. Albumin administration may improve microcirculatory blood flow, increase organ perfusion, decrease leukocyte rolling and adherence, and reduce the inflammatory response [59]. Albumin preserves the blood brain barrier (BBB) by abolishing the hyperactivation of metalloproteinases −2 and −9 (MMP-2/9) following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suggesting MMP-2 and MMP-9 are key mediators for the albumin-induced neurovascular protection [53]. Moreover, albumin is considered the major antioxidant agent in the body. Albumin functions as an endogenous nitric oxide (NO) reservoir via binding of its sulfhydryl moiety of cysteine 34 residue with NO to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). It is worth mentioning that 82 % of NO in blood is preserved in stable form as RSNO [13]. Therefore, albumin is able to neutralize the excessive circulating NO so as to prevent the nitro-oxidative stress and, on the other hand, to continue to release NO when the concentrations of low-molecular thiols are elevated. Thereby, albumin via RSNO-adducted NO can relax blood vessels, inhibit platelet aggregation, and increase aortic blood flow [53].\",\r\n        \"In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline, most probably because the hypo-osmolar (4 %) albumin solution with mean measured osmolarity of 266 (266–267) mOsm/kg H2O used in the study induced increases in intracranial pressure but not the use of albumin per se [60, 61]. However, the use of 4 and 20 % solutions in 93 patients with severe TBI and Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8 in addition to a neutral or to a slightly negative fluid balance was associated with low mortality in those patients [62]. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be hypo-osmolar solutions should not be used in patients with TBI [63].\",\r\n        \"The activation of systemic inflammatory and hemostatic systems that takes place during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) results in fibrin formation, platelet activation/consumption, and endothelial damage. However, the use of 5 % albumin in priming the CPB machine has many advantages, such as preservation of oncotic pressure, preventing fibrinogen and platelet adhesion, and endothelial glycocalyx protection. In addition, it maintains the vascular barrier competency, prevents interstitial edema, and keeps the integrity of the microcirculation [64].\",\r\n        \"Oliver et al. compared 5 % albumin priming with fresh frozen plasma (FFP)-based priming in pediatric patients [65]. Patients in the 5 % albumin group had significantly lower administration of blood products. It was shown that using albumin for the priming volume, a dilution of coagulation factors is accepted during CPB. This will lead to less thrombin generation and consumption of coagulation factors and the FFP will be supplemented after protamine administration. However, the use of FFP as a priming solution will result in enhancing the thrombin formation during CPB, thereby more heparin is needed and more consumption of coagulation factors is triggered.\",\r\n        \"The use of albumin in priming the adult CPB may compete with fibrinogen in the formation of the protein layer coating the circuit and the oxygenator, and the preadsorption of albumin prevents fibrinogen adsorption and platelet adhesion. Russell et al. have shown in their meta-analysis that albumin compared with crystalloids as a priming solution exerts a number of beneficial effects, including platelet count and colloid osmotic preservation [66].\",\r\n        \"The use of albumin in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery has resulted in the preservation in clot formation time and maximum clot firmness. However, the use of low molar hydroxyethyl starch solutions (HES) (6 % 200/0.5 or 130/0.4) resulted in prolongation in clot formation time and reduction in maximum clot firmness [67]. Moreover, the use of old high-molar HES and gelatin solutions correlated with the amount of postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery, but the use of 4 % albumin solution did not [68]. The same results have been confirmed in a meta-analysis comparing the use of HES solutions with albumin. Hemodynamics were similar in both groups, but the use of albumin decreased blood loss, the amount of blood products transfusions, and the need for reoperation postoperatively [69]. The presence of hypoalbuminemia (cutoff 18 g/L) after cardiac surgery was found to be a better predictor for mortality after cardiac surgery – even better than EUROscore [70]. In a recently published prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the preemptive correction of a low preoperative albumin level by administering HSA in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is associated significant reduction in the incidence of AKI, from 26 % in the control group to 13.7 % in the albumin group. The editorial that accompanied the study has suggested that restoring the target level is associated with reduction in AKI in amplitude greater than that of any known intervention in patients undergoing OPCAB [71, 72].\",\r\n        \"Edwin Cohn’s development of stable albumin solution during World War II was based on a fractionation scheme, which was rapidly adopted by a number of pharmaceutical companies. The pasteurization technique used in albumin solutions production is very effective in eliminating the risk for viral and bacterial infections. Moreover, the recent introduction of ion exchange chromatography in the production of albumin is very effective in reducing the risk of prion disease transmission by albumin solutions [73]. The use of albumin is considered safe practice; in a study evaluating adverse event reporting between 1998 and 2000, the incidence of all reported serious nonfatal and fatal adverse events was just five per million doses, and no patient death was classified as probably related to albumin administration [74].\",\r\n        \"Currently available human albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidants prosperities, and capacity to bind drugs [75]. It is noteworthy to mention that cysteine 34 – the most important antioxidant residue in HSA – is oxidized in 23 % of healthy human volunteers versus 54–60 % in commercial preparations [76], which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions [77].\",\r\n        \"Albumin solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, mainly 20–25 % or 4–5 %. Iso-oncotic preparations of HSA are more effective than crystalloids solutions in maintaining the intravascular volume (>80 % vs. <20 %) [78]. Hypertonic albumin (20–25 %) is used in patients with edema as it avoids excessive sodium and chloride loads [75]. Nevertheless, hypotonic 4 % solutions should not be used in patients with traumatic brain injuries.\",\r\n        \"The excessive need for the HSA solutions has encouraged its production using recombinant DNA technology in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. HSA molecule structure is quite complicated; with 35 cysteine residues, 34 of them form disulfide bonds. Such complicated structure in this large recombinant protein could be a burden in both protein synthesis and folding system, which could result in the low expression or incorrect folding of recombinant HSA (rHSA). Recently, transgenic rice Oryza sativa has been used successfully as a novel bioreactor to produce sufficient quantities of safe rHSA. However, to establish appropriate impurity removal and detection methods in rHSA manufacturing remains a challenge (Fig. 9.4) [79, 80].\\n\",\r\n        \"HSA has many physiological and biochemical properties that render its use relevant to many aspects of the disordered vascular and cellular functions. HSA has not yet showed all its secrets, and its benefits can only be realized by conducting clinical trials appropriately powered to relevant clinical endpoints.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123816/\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nconst similar_paper_1_2 = [\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7264801\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1111/cjag.12234\",\r\n    title: \"Framing consumer food demand responses in a viral pandemic\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2020-05-28\",\r\n    authors: [\"John.Cranfield\"],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"INTRODUCTION\",\r\n          \"INTRODUCTION\",\r\n          \"INTRODUCTION\",\r\n          \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\",\r\n          \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\",\r\n          \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\",\r\n          \"STRUCTURE OF PREFERENCES\",\r\n          \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\",\r\n          \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\",\r\n          \"HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS\",\r\n          \"PRICE EFFECTS\",\r\n          \"PRICE EFFECTS\",\r\n          \"SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS\",\r\n          \"SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS\",\r\n          \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\",\r\n          \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\",\r\n          \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\",\r\n          \"SHOPPING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIORS\",\r\n          \"CONCLUSION\",\r\n          \"CONCLUSION\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\",\r\n          \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\",\r\n          \"categories-and-subject-descriptors\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"conclusions\",\r\n          \"conclusions\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"The COVID‐19 pandemic is an unprecedented episode in the last 100 years of human history. All of Canadian society will feel the impact of this pandemic. Beyond the immediate threat to health, employment, and income, food is one area where we will see an impact across all Canadians. What is more, agents and economic actors across the entirety of our agri‐food supply chains will feel this impact. Given that consumer demand pulls food through these agri‐food supply chains, it is important to understand Canadians’ food demand in the immediacy of the pandemic and related economic downturn, and likely through the shadow of both.\",\r\n        \"The disruption to society and markets arising from Black Swan events is not new. Examples from the last two decades include the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre, the 2003 SARS epidemic, the 2003 North American BSE crisis, various food safety recalls,1To be clear, there is no evidence to suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic is a food safety issue. the 2008/2009 financial crisis, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. COVID‐19 is different. It is different because this is a highly contagious virus for which no known and proven vaccine yet exists. It is different because of the economic disruption arising from the shuttering of economic and commercial activity on an almost unparalleled scale. It is different because of the disruption to work, home, and personal routine (e.g., working from home, physical distancing, school closures, closure of non‐essential business, the response by food service and grocery retail sectors). It is different because we are dealing with the concurrence of a viral pandemic and economic downturn. While the response to and impact of past Black Swan events are informative, they cannot help us fully anticipate the impact of the double‐whammy of such a significant viral pandemic and economic downturn.\",\r\n        \"This paper explores how COVID‐19 could impact consumer demand for food. The paper contains no literature review, no conceptual or empirical model, nor any empirical analysis. It offers some thoughts intended to stimulate discussion (and research). The paper is structured around five areas: the structure of preferences, household budgets, price effects, socioeconomic factors, and consumer behavior. It is important to emphasize that the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand (and shopping behaviors) will differ across the intersection of individual and household experiences, characteristics, and contexts. In understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on demand for food, there is no average effect that carries meaning. Differential impacts and distributional consequences will be profoundly important in understanding the impact of COVID‐19 on consumer food demand.\",\r\n        \"The structure of preferences will be an important issue in understanding how consumers respond to COVID‐19. I see three immediate areas where the structure of the utility function should reflect the circumstances around COVID‐19. The first concerns what is in a consumer's utility function. Beyond consumption quantities, one might imagine that in light of COVID‐19, the well‐being of others might enter into one's utility function. This gets at whether an individual is making decisions for themselves, or in a way that reflects the wellbeing of others (be they other members of the household, family, or broader society). In this respect, notions of altruism and interdependent utility functions become important. More broadly than this, one could think about incorporating the notions of personal and social capital in the utility function and defining these forms of latent capital as functions of choices made (Becker & Murphy, 2000). The idea here would be that an individual derives utility of services flowing from personal and social capital, while personal and social capital depend on the elements of choice and may well reflect the choice one makes for themselves, others, and conceivably others’ choice.\",\r\n        \"Second, the temporal nature of choice also needs consideration when thinking about consumer demand for food in a pandemic. The issue is whether food consumption occurs at the time of purchase. Under normal circumstances, most households separate the purchase and consumption decisions, leading to home inventories being held as a matter of convenience. Given changes to the retail grocery landscape (e.g., some stores having reduced hours or limits on the number of people in the store at one time, and transaction costs associated with on‐line purchasing, etc.) it may be that some consumers continue to purchase and store inventories at home as a matter of convenience. It is also possible that some households increase their home inventories to reduce the number of future shopping trips (and thus limiting their perceived risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus).\",\r\n        \"Purchasing now for later consumption introduces a dynamic inventory problem that reflects a discount rate for the future utility from consumption. This brings into to play two important issues—consumer discount rates and the time horizon in a consumer's mind when deciding how much to buy now for later consumption. I would hazard a guess that the planning horizon is longer in the COVID‐19 environment, and discount rates smaller, thus making future consumption more of a concern, and leading to excess inventory holding. Temporal considerations could also affect what is purchased. Given a longer planning horizon, and potentially lower discount rates, one might expect to see a rise in demand for easily stored food items, and a fall in demand for not easily stored food items or foods whose quality falls with storage. In this respect we might see substitution between the form the underlying food good takes—for instance, substituting between fresh fruit and canned fruit.\",\r\n        \"Excess inventory holding leads to the third structure of preference issue, namely uncertainty. A longer time horizon and lower discount rates may lead to excess inventory holding compared to pre‐COVID‐19 periods, but so too could risk or uncertainty. In the absence of a definite end to the COVID‐19 pandemic, some may undertake excess in‐home food inventory holding as an insurance against future stockouts at the grocery store—a consumer version of the convenience yield in commodity storage if you will. In this sense, “hoarding” may be a rational response to expected future stockouts, with the cost of excess purchases viewed as a risk premium for informal insurance against grocery store stockouts. If true, then somewhat paradoxically, this form of self‐insurance could lead to behaviors that create a stockout.\",\r\n        \"While the structure of preferences is important to bear in mind, so too are limits on choice through income and time constraints. Continuance of income/cash flows is important in understanding consumer response to COVID‐19. For those affected by a loss of income, an open and important question is whether and how participation in Canada's Employment Insurance program and the recently announced Canada Emergency Response Benefit impacts their demand for food. Also important is whether and how demand for food changes by those whose incomes are partially supported by their employers accessing the federal government's Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program. On both scores, the potential distribution effects will be important to understand. An individual's capacity to draw on saving or liquid assets, or rely on credit‐based (e.g., credit cards or a line of credit) consumption smoothing, are also important factors to consider, and which carry broader distribution issues insofar as access to credit is concerned.\",\r\n        \"Demand for food and most food products in Canada tends to be income‐normal. We would expect a proportionally smaller reduction in demand for a food product than the proportional reduction in income/expenditure. Despite this, lessons from the 2008/2009 financial crisis remind us of what we might expect to see—namely, a higher degree of economizing in the food purchasing decision in the face of income/expenditure reductions. This can take varied forms, including eliminating the purchase of foods not deemed essential in the consumers' mind, reduced consumption of some goods, or within‐category substituting away from relatively higher‐priced alternatives. In light of expected income reductions, we might also expect to see a fall in demand for some niche and premium priced food products as people substitute towards value‐priced and non‐niche equivalents. While not related to food, we might also see deferral or postponing of big‐ticket purchases (e.g., vacation, durable goods, etc.) and mortgage/rent deferrals as a way to generate liquidity to support the purchase of necessities. Unlike the 2008/2009 financial crisis, large portions of the foodservice sector have closed or changed their business model in light of COVID‐19—by circumstance, we are seeing fewer Canadians eating out of the home. What we do not know is whether the resulting reduction in household expenditures on services translates into greater liquidity when buying food for consumption in the home. We do not really understand the degree of substitutability between expenditure on food consumed in the home and food consumed out of the home, and especially so during an event like COVID‐19.\",\r\n        \"The allocation of individual and household time is also changing, and this might impact the demand for food. School closures, the closing of non‐essential businesses, work‐from‐home arrangements, and closing of recreational facilities, churches, and other civic venues, and their programs, means more Canadians are at home. Some have more time available for new uses, while others will have new and competing demands on their time. This new organization of households and decisions concerning an individual's allocation of time could have a bearing on demand for food. On the one hand, I could imagine individuals and households undertaking a more concerted effort to consume food prepared in the home, and which offer potentially enhanced health and nutrition profiles. On the other hand, I can see the new challenges of household organization and individual time use leading to a rise in demand for prepared, heat‐and‐eat food products, as well as meal kits. Both carry an expectation of an increase in demand, but demand for ingredients on the one hand, and convenience foods on the other. What we actually observe will depend on the lifecycle and composition of the home, and the duration of the pandemic and closure of foodservice establishments offering dine‐in options. A longer pandemic might lead some to invest in human capital by learning new food preparation skills that enable them to create meals from base ingredients, rather than relying on prepared foods. But, the time pressure for those working‐from‐home and with children (or other dependents) in the home will be different from those who are not working and/or do not have children (or other dependents) in the home. The opportunity cost of one's time (and within the context of the household) will be very important in understanding how consumer demand for food changes in response to COVID‐19, and in understanding a decision to invest in new food preparation skills.\",\r\n        \"At the time of writing, we cannot attribute COVID‐19 to widespread, persistent changes in the price of food. While stockouts have occurred, the price impact of these stockouts appears muted by a responsive supply chain. Unlike legislated or regulated rationing and price controls implemented during WWII, we have not seen institutional rationing or price controls outside of preexisting conditions in some regulated agricultural markets. This is not to say that price gouging has not happened in the face of spikes in demand, but we have the ability to protect consumers through established Federal and Provincial consumer protection and emergency legislation. For instance, using the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, the Province of Ontario recently announced new fines and penalties for those found guilty of price gouging. Other means of “policing” pricing behavior also exist—for instance, using social media to publicly shame establishments undertaking such practices, and firms self‐policing their pricing policies as a matter of good public relations and corporate governance.\",\r\n        \"Supply chain responsiveness is key to the short‐run price stability we have seen thus far. However, longer‐term effects are less clear, especially as the first expected wave of COVID‐19 is accelerating at a time when much of North American agricultural is begin its planting season. We may well see price increases in the future if there are systematic and sustained disruption of distribution channels or agricultural production.2One issue which might be particularly important in Canada in this regard is access to seasonal agricultural workers. Demand for many groups of commodities tends to be price inelastic, meaning the expected proportional impact on demand would be less than the proportional increase in price. As well, given the variety of quality, selection and varying price points in most grocery stores, I would expect the between and intragroup substitutability to be an important part of how consumers economize in the face of relative price increases.\",\r\n        \"Preferences, prices, and income are important considerations in understanding how demand for food responds during the COVID‐19 crisis. But so too are sociodemographic factors that reflect the lifecycle of the individual and household. This is not to say that sociodemographic factors drive changes in demand; rather, that changes in food demand arising from COVID‐19 may have a differential effect across individuals and households with different characteristics. Ignoring these sociodemographic effects robs us of understanding the deeper insights of how COVID‐19 may affect consumer demand for food in Canada. But what sociodemographic factors do you consider? A variety of observables come to mind: gender and identity, age, education, migrant status, employment status, ability status, and household composition are all important. So too is the intersection of these characteristics insofar as defining broader segments of consumers that might lend itself to insights about common responses across subgroups of the population at similar stages of their lifecycles.\",\r\n        \"Additional consideration should be given to sociodemographic characteristics which capture those in vulnerable groups. These groups include those who face precarious employment (and income), the homeless, those who face food insecurity, and those who are immune compromised or for whom it would be unwise to leave their homes in light of the COVID‐19 virus. While not at all exhaustive, I hope this underscores the fact that there are groups with precarious socioeconomic status who may be marginalized, and whose food demands may be particularly affected by COVID‐19.\",\r\n        \"COVID‐19 is affecting where and how people shop, and may well influence what people buy and consume. Weeks into the COVID‐19 pandemic and we are seeing changes in the channel and venue that people use to acquire food. Restaurants are almost universally closed for order‐in or sit‐down service, and those that remain open are doing so with reduced hours, a limited menu selection, and delivery or drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options. This means Canadians have likely reduced their frequency of eating out of the home. Interestingly, restaurants that only offer drive‐thru/curbside pick‐up options point to the role of transport and the intersection of access to transport and socioeconomic status. For some, transportation needed to access food may be a limiting factor. Reductions in public transport services in some locales (as a means to limit the risk of exposure to COVID‐19) potentially magnifies this effect. Nonetheless, as mentioned previously, reduced food‐away‐from‐home options could alleviate income effects in that a dollar now spent in a grocery store may go further than a dollar previously spent in a foodservice establishment. Admittedly, this comparison omits a time and skill element; planning and preparing a meal takes time and knowledge—account needs to be taken of the in‐sourced services now provided by the consumer (or in‐home food preparer) that the foodservice establishment provided previously.\",\r\n        \"Most retail grocery venues remain open but with reduced hours (to give staff a break and allow for restocking) and, in some cases, with limits on the number of people in the store at any given time (as a means of ensuring physical distancing), and limits on how much of an item one may buy at one time. In some locales, farmers' markets have been closed as a means of limiting the risk of exposure to the COVID‐19 virus, potentially having an impact on buying locally. We have also seen dedicated hours for those in more vulnerable groups at some retail grocery chains. As I mentioned above, we are likely seeing less frequent trips to grocery venues—likely due to heightened concerns of exposure to the COVID‐19, directives by various levels of government, or competing demands on time arising from new home‐based activities (e.g., care of dependents). At the same time, we are seeing a rise in online grocery shopping (Robertson, 2020), and I would expect to see a rise in home meal kits. The timing of online grocery services is an issue, with longer lead times for orders than before the COVID‐19 pandemic, thus requiring more planning and potentially placing greater demands on the time needed for food choice in the household.\",\r\n        \"I believe it would be a fool's errand to predict changes in demand for a particular food or food group. Too much is changing too fast. But, two observations come to bear in the context of what people are buying. First, we are seeing evidence that the food manufacturing sector is changing their product runs to focus on more basic product forms (Baum & Robertson, 2020). Second, we are seeing a rise in demand for the ingredients used in baking (Strong, 2020). The former might point to market responsiveness in the context of firm's expectation of consumers economizing behavior. The latter might point to Canadians seeking self‐sufficiency in light of the pandemic (i.e., in‐sourcing the preparation of what we otherwise buy in a prepared form, e.g., making bread at home instead of buying it at a store), or an inclination toward foods that bring comfort in a time of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. It will be interesting to see if the demand for foods or food ingredients that contain “comfort” attributes will rise during the pandemic.\",\r\n        \"Several other issues arise in the context of shopping behavior and what people buy. As it appears some people are stocking up, will there be an unintended rise in food waste related to perishable products, or products which exceed their best before date prior to consumption? Relatedly, how will people use leftovers to make their food dollar go further and potentially limit the number of trips they make to a grocery venue (or limit the number of orders they make online). Lastly, how will changes in consumption behaviors manifest themselves in a movement along an Engel curve (pointing to the greater importance in food expenditure during a recession) and translate into a change in farmer's share of consumer's food dollar?\",\r\n        \"This paper explores several issues related to the potential impact of COVID‐19 on food demand. It offers casual observation with no analysis. Moving beyond a static, certain approach to the structure of preferences will help us understand observed behavior (e.g., stockpiling) and possibly understanding future behaviors in a COVID‐19 world. Income and time constraints will matter. Tighter incomes will likely lead to substituting behaviors within and between food groups. However, people shifting food expenditures from away‐from‐home to in‐home consumption will temper this effect. New routines forced by work‐from‐home requirements, school closures, and physical distancing will impact the opportunity cost of time and may lead to new food behaviors. Muted short‐run retail food price effects are evident. However, how the agricultural sector fares in light of physical distancing and possible disruptions to agricultural labor markets and production practices lends itself to the possibility of higher food prices in the long run (and possibly increased price volatility). It will be important to understand the impact on food demand arising from policy interventions related to wages and income. This understanding should take account of sociodemographic factors, and the intersection of these factors. Lastly, where and how people shop has and will continue to change as the COVID‐19 pandemic evolves in Canada. Whether these changes persist will depend on the duration of the pandemic and associated economic downturn.\",\r\n        \"Like all countries, Canada has groups vulnerable to and affected by food insecurity. However, as a nation, Canadians have come to expect an assured supply of food. While recent spikes in demand at the food retail level have led to stockouts, the responsive nature of our food supply chains means these shortages have been short‐lived. Given that COVID‐19 has not led to restrictions on food and agricultural trade, and given the resilient nature of our agricultural sector, I remain optimistic about the continuity of the food supply. Barring significant disruption to agricultural production, my thinking leads me to conclude that demand‐side factors will drive most of the changes we will observe in food markets. In this respect, income/expenditure, the opportunity cost of time, and longer planning horizons will account for the lion's share of these demand‐side drivers. I hope these musings will stimulate discussion amongst the broader community and lead to empirical analysis that improves our understanding of whether and how a Black Swan event like COVID‐19 affects consumer choice.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url: \"https://doi.org/10.1111/cjag.12234\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC4094370\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1007/s00705-013-1942-x\",\r\n    title:\r\n      \"Molecular detection and genetic characterization of kobuviruses and astroviruses in asymptomatic local pigs in East Africa\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2013-12-11\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Joshua.Amimo\",\r\n      \"Edward.Okoth\",\r\n      \"Joseph.Junga\",\r\n      \"William.Ogara\",\r\n      \"Moses.Njahira\",\r\n      \"Qiuhong.Wang\",\r\n      \"Anastasia.Vlasova\",\r\n      \"Linda.Saif\",\r\n      \"Appolinaire.Djikeng\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Sample collection ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Sequencing and molecular analysis ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Sequencing and molecular analysis ::: Materials and methods\",\r\n          \"Incidence of kobuvirus infection ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Incidence of kobuvirus infection ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of East African porcine kobuviruses ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of porcine astroviruses ::: Results and discussion\",\r\n          \"Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of porcine astroviruses ::: Results and discussion\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"Small-scale pig production (free range or small backyard herds) constitutes >70 % of the total pig farms in East Africa. Pigs in this region often live in close proximity to humans, causing public health concerns and a need for increasing health standards. East Africa is also known for the large population of wild (bush) pigs and warthogs that are in close contact with domestic pigs, creating favorable conditions for intermixing and spread of viral strains. Emerging viruses represent a threat to human and food animal health, as evidenced by sporadic outbreaks of influenza and coronavirus infection. Hence, knowledge about the diversity of viruses present in reservoir animals can lead to a better understanding of the origin of emerging pathogens. Kobuviruses, which are members of the genus Kobuvirus, family Picornaviridae, are small, non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA. The genus Kobuvirus includes three officially recognized species: Aichivirus A, Aichivirus B (bovine kobuvirus), and Aichivirus C (porcine kobuvirus) [1]. The kobuvirus genome is approximately 8.3 kb long and is organized into three structural (VP0, VP3 and VP1) and seven non-structural (2A-2C and 3A-3D) regions with a leader protein (L). The 3D gene region encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and represents a region that is conserved among kobuviruses [2]. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the 3D RdRp coding region among porcine kobuvirus, bovine kobuvirus and Aichi virus vary from 74.0 % to 81.0 % [3]. Aichi virus was first detected in Japan in 1989 from a human patient with acute gastroenteritis [4]. Since then, Aichi virus has been detected in Asia, Europe, South America and Tunisia [5–8]. Bovine kobuvirus was first recognized in 2003 as a cytopathic contaminant in cell culture medium derived from bovine serum in Japan. Later, it was found in fecal samples of clinically healthy cattle [9]. Bovine kobuvirus has also been detected in domestic sheep in Hungary [10, 11]. Porcine kobuvirus (S-1-HUN/2007: EU787450) was first identified from fecal samples of domestic pigs in 2008 in Hungary [1]. Thereafter, porcine kobuvirus was reported in additional countries, including Asian countries [12, 13], the Netherlands and Brazil [14], and the USA [15]. The prevalence of kobuvirus infection in pigs ranges from 30 % to 99 %. This large variation could be a result of different ages within the populations evaluated, diarrheal status, regional differences, and other factors. Studies showing association of porcine kobuvirus infection with clinical disease are limited; however, a recent study in Korea found an association between porcine kobuvirus detection and diarrhea in pigs [13]. An association between kobuvirus infection and age has been reported in cattle and in pigs [16].\",\r\n        \"Astroviruses belong to the family Astroviridae, which consists of two genera: Avastrovirus and Mamastrovirus, whose members are associated with gastroenteritis in avian and mammalian hosts, respectively. Astroviruses are generally associated with either mild or severe enteric disease symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting in a number of mammalian species [17]. Bridger in the UK and Saif et al. [18, 19] in the USA reported the first porcine astroviruses (PAstV) detected in pigs by electron microscopy. Later in 1990, PAstV was isolated in Japan [20]. Recently, Mor and co-workers also reported PAstV in pigs in the USA with a prevalence of 62 % [21]. To date, five PAstV types (PAstV1–PAstV5) have been identified from different countries, including the Czech Republic, Colombia, Canada, the USA, China and Hungary [22–27]. Among the five types, PAstV1, PAstV2 and PAstV3 were identified in fecal samples from healthy pigs.\",\r\n        \"Epidemiological information on the geographical distribution, incidence and genetic diversity of kobuviruses in African swine populations is not available. In this study, we report the first detection of porcine kobuviruses in samples collected from nursing and weaned pigs in East Africa and analyze the phylogenetic relationships between the East African porcine kobuvirus strains and known kobuvirus strains as well as other representative picornaviruses. This study also reports the first detection of porcine astrovirus in this region.\",\r\n        \"Accession numbers of nucleotide sequences strains described in this study were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: kobuviruses, KF494340-KF494343 and KF597279; astroviruses, KF597280-KF597282.\",\r\n        \"A total of 251 fecal samples were obtained from nursing and post-weaning piglets raised in small-scale farms (n = 1 to 25 pigs per farm) with different management systems in western Kenya (n = 140) and eastern Uganda (n = 111). The management system consisted of pigs being housed, housed and tethered, housed and free-range, tethered, tethered and free-range and free-range. The pigs were mostly fed swill from hotels and leftover household food. The sample collection consisted of 41 samples from nursing pigs (less than 4 weeks of age), 90 samples from post-weaning pigs (12 weeks of age) and 120 samples from growers (16 weeks of age). All pigs appeared clinically healthy at the time of sampling. Fresh samples were collected from individual pigs, placed into a sterile specimen container and stored on dry ice before being transported to the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) laboratory in Busia, where the samples were stored at −70 °C until use. The samples were then shipped to the BecA-ILRI laboratories in Nairobi for analysis.\",\r\n        \"Fecal samples were prepared as 10 % (v/v) fecal suspensions in minimum essential medium (MEM). The prepared sample suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged for 30 min at 1,800×g, 4 °C. RNA was extracted from a 250-μl starting volume of centrifuged 10 % fecal suspensions using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA recovered was suspended in 40 μl of nuclease-free water and stored at −70 °C until used. cDNA was synthesised using a Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo scientific®) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and the cDNA was immediately used for amplification or stored at −20 °C.\",\r\n        \"Previous studies using the calicivirus primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29] targeting the calicivirus RdRp gene (317 nt for norovirus and 329 nt for sapovirus) also amplified the 3D RdRp regions of porcine kobuvirus (~1100 nt) [15], which was confirmed by sequence analysis of five representative suspect samples in the present report. This same primer pair was used for the detection of porcine kobuviruses from East African pigs. RT-PCR was carried out using Accupower® PCR premix (Bioneer Co, S. Korea) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Accupower® PCR premix is a ready-to-use lyophilized premix of dNTPs, Taq DNA Polymerase, reaction buffer, a tracking dye, and a stabilizer. Briefly, in each 20-μl reaction premix tube, 2 μl (5-50 ng) of cDNA template was mixed with 1 μl (10 pMol) each of forward and reverse primers, and 16 μl of nuclease-free water. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C of 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The temperature was then held at 4 °C. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after staining with Gel Red™ nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium, Hayward, CA). When bands were found in the region of 1,100 bp on the agarose gel, we tentatively considered the results kobuvirus positive. The samples with the correct band size were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for sequencing. In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the PCR products of three selected samples from three different farms were determined by direct sequencing.\",\r\n        \"To confirm the RT-PCR results and to obtain genetic information on virus diversity, the partial 3D RdRp amplicons of five kobuvirus-positive samples were sequenced directly using forward (p110) and reverse (p290) primers using BigDye Terminator cycle chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting RdRP gene sequences were edited using Bioedit version 7.1.9 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and compared with sequences of kobuvirus reference strains in the GenBank database by BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Sequence similarity analysis was performed for the aligned nucleotide and amino acid sequences using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Phylogenetic analysis of the East African porcine kobuviruses with kobuvirus reference strains based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments was conducted using the neighbor-joining method supported with a bootstrap test of 1000 replicates in MEGA 5 software [30]. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tamura 3-parameter method and are in units of base substitutions per site.\",\r\n        \"To analyze porcine kobuvirus infection in pigs of different ages with different management systems, the piglet fecal samples were divided according to the age of the animals into three groups: nursing, ≤1-month-old (n = 47), weaned, (3-month-old, n = 90) and growers (>4-month-old, n = 120). Statistical analysis was performed with SAS® to compare the proportions of kobuvirus-positive samples among the four districts, the two countries, the three age groups evaluated and the six different management systems. The analysis was performed using the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test. The confidence limit for the statistical tests was set at 95 % (P < 0.05).\",\r\n        \"Kobuvirus RNA was detected in 13.1 % (33/251) of the pig fecal samples analyzed using primer pair p110/p290 [28, 29]. Kobuvirus was detected in both Kenya (14.9 %) and Uganda (15.5 %) in equal proportions, and in all four districts sampled (Table 1), an indication of a general circulation and endemicity of the virus on the tested farms. Among the age groups, younger piglets shed more virus than older pigs, and a higher incidence (15 of 90, 16.7 %) of kobuvirus was reported in post-weaning (3-month-old) piglets compared to nursing piglets (6 of 41, 14.6 %) and grower pigs (12 of 120, 10 %). This could possibly be due to an inefficient immune response, diminishing maternal immunity post-weaning, or other intrinsic age-related factors. Higher rates of infection in young piglets has also been reported in other studies [3, 13, 14]. Based on management systems in the study area, confinement of pigs presented a higher risk of kobuvirus infection, with housed pigs shedding more virus than free-ranging pigs (Table 1). This could be the result of viral accumulation in the pig houses or the places where pigs are tethered. Additionally, kobuvirus was more prevalent in the farms with larger herd size (>10 pigs, 20 %) than farms with small herds (<10 pigs, 12.6 %).\\n\",\r\n        \"The incidence of porcine kobuvirus infection reported in this study (13.1 %) was lower than that reported in other countries, which ranged between 30.1 % in China and 99 % in Thailand [3, 31–33]. A recent study in Korea detected porcine kobuvirus in 84.5 % of diarrheic pigs and 19.3 % of healthy pigs [13]. Similarly, a study in Japan using samples from healthy pigs reported 45.4 % prevalence of porcine kobuvirus [12]. This difference may be attributable to variations in the samples due to factors like sampling time, sampling place (distribution of sampling farms), sample size, age of pigs, and clinical background of the tested animal population (diarrhea or clinically healthy). The association of this agent with enteric diseases in pigs in the study area remains unclear, since we only analyzed samples from asymptomatic pigs, and no data were available from tests for kobuvirus in pigs with gastroenteritis from the same farms; however, some of the positive samples came from farms with a history of diarrhea. This study confirmed that infection with kobuvirus in asymptomatic pigs is common, as has been reported in other studies [14, 32, 34]. Further studies on risk factors for this infection and the association of this virus with gastroenteritis are necessary, especially in developing countries where a majority of pigs are raised in smallholder production systems with varied management.\",\r\n        \"To gain more information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine kobuvirus strains circulating in swine in the East African farms, five kobuvirus-positive samples were selected, and their partial 3D RdRP region was sequenced. Genetic analysis of the partial sequence revealed that the kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are more variable, sharing nucleotide sequence identity ranging from 89.7 from 99.1 % among them. At the nucleotide and amino acid level, they were 69.4–70.7 % and 70.7–71.9 % identical, respectively, to Aichi virus, 73.1–74.4 % and 78.8–80.5 % to bovine kobuvirus, 70.8-71.9 % and 78.5-79.5 % to kobuvirus in sheep, 67-70.7 % and 67.8-69.1 % to canine kobuviruses and 88-92.3 % and 90.4-97.5 % to other porcine kobuviruses (Table 2).\\n\",\r\n        \"Phylogenetic analysis of partial 3D RdRp nucleotide and amino acid sequences of porcine kobuvirus strains detected in this study, together with published sequences of kobuvirus reference strains (porcine kobuviruses, aichi viruses and bovine kobuvirus) and representatives of other picornaviruses, revealed that three of the detected strains (Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279) grouped together and formed their own cluster, while one of the strains (K-118-KF494342) clustered with Chinese strains, and another strain (K-460-KF494343) clustered with Korean strains (Fig. 1). This indicates that porcine kobuviruses circulating in the East African region are genetically diverse. Damaris-3-KF494340, Kuoba-3-KF494341 and K-1033-KF597279 samples were collected in the same geographical location, indicating that porcine kobuviruses in the East African region may be geographically restricted; however, more strains from different parts of East Africa need to be sequenced to ascertain the geographical distribution of this virus. Genetic diversity among geographically separated porcine kobuviruses have been reported in other studies [13].\\n\",\r\n        \"Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that the five strains detected were more closely related to the kobuviruses, notably porcine kobuvirus, than to any other picornaviruses, and this was supported by the 100 % bootstrap value (Fig. 1). Evidence of a close genetic relationship or interspecies transmission among different viruses in the genus Kobuvirus has been documented. A sheep kobuvirus strain has high nucleotide sequence identity to bovine kobuvirus [10], and one porcine kobuvirus is more closely related to bovine kobuvirus than to porcine strains [12]. However, in this study, we did not find kobuvirus strains that were similar to members of kobuviruses from species other than pigs.\",\r\n        \"In other fecal samples, an approximately 720-nt-long weak, nonspecific RT-PCR product was also observed. The nucleotide (nt) sequences of the RT-PCR products of three selected samples were determined by direct sequencing, and the result showed that one of the strains (K-268-KF597282) had 86.1 % nt sequence identity to porcine astrovirus type 2 in the RdRp gene. The other two strains (K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281) had 96.7 % identity to porcine astrovirus type 3. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, in which K-006-KF597280 and K-332-KF597281 strains clustered with astrovirus type 3 (PAstV-3-US-MO123-JX556691) detected in the USA, while the K-268-KF597282 strain clustered with astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2/2007/HUN-GU562296) detected in Hungary (Fig. 2). Recent studies in the USA revealed high genetic heterogeneity of PAstV strains [35]. The importance of co-circulation of PAstVs and the role pigs may play in the transmission and recombination of this virus need further investigation.\\n\",\r\n        \"In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that porcine kobuviruses and astroviruses are present in the swine population in East Africa, and to our knowledge, this study reports the first detection of porcine kobuvirus and astrovirus in this African region and the first molecular analysis of the detected strains. The presence of these gastroenteritis-producing viruses in clinically healthy pigs represents a source of infection of pigs, and possibly to humans, and hence, further studies are required to determine their role in gastrointestinal infections of pigs in this region and to determine their genetic diversity in order to develop accurate diagnostic tools and implement appropriate control strategies.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url:\r\n      \"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-013-1942-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24327095/\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC5311072\",\r\n    doi: \"10.3389/fpubh.2017.00020\",\r\n    title: \"A Blueprint to Evaluate One Health\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2017-02-16\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Simon.Rüegg\",\r\n      \"Barry.McMahon\",\r\n      \"Barbara.Häsler\",\r\n      \"Roberto.Esposito\",\r\n      \"Liza.Nielsen\",\r\n      \"Chinwe.Ifejika Speranza\",\r\n      \"Timothy.Ehlinger\",\r\n      \"Marisa.Peyre\",\r\n      \"Maurizio.Aragrande\",\r\n      \"Jakob.Zinsstag\",\r\n      \"Philip.Davies\",\r\n      \"Andrei.Mihalca\",\r\n      \"Sandra.Buttigieg\",\r\n      \"Jonathan.Rushton\",\r\n      \"Luís.Carmo\",\r\n      \"Daniele.De Meneghi\",\r\n      \"Massimo.Canali\",\r\n      \"Maria.Filippitzi\",\r\n      \"Flavie.Goutard\",\r\n      \"Vlatko.Ilieski\",\r\n      \"Dragan.Milićević\",\r\n      \"Helen.O’Shea\",\r\n      \"Miroslav.Radeski\",\r\n      \"Richard.Kock\",\r\n      \"Anthony.Staines\",\r\n      \"Ann.Lindberg\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Introduction\",\r\n          \"Drivers ::: Characterizing OH\",\r\n          \"Operations ::: Characterizing OH\",\r\n          \"Supporting Infrastructure ::: Characterizing OH\",\r\n          \"Outcomes ::: Characterizing OH\",\r\n          \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\",\r\n          \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\",\r\n          \"The Added Value of OH ::: Discussion\",\r\n          \"The Realization of OH ::: Discussion\",\r\n          \"Author Contributions\",\r\n          \"Conflict of Interest Statement\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"introduction\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"method\",\r\n          \"related-works\",\r\n          \"general-terms\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"One Health (OH) positions health professionals as agents for change and provides a platform to both measure and manage determinants of health seldom fully covered by medicine or public health alone. The integration of human, animal, and environmental health has a long history (1–4). Recent financial, economic, social, environmental, and health crises have led to the renewed recognition that collaborative approaches between disciplines are urgently needed (5, 6). The fear of emerging pandemics, as well as climate change, drug resistance, food and water security and safety, has caused a shift from an interdisciplinary approach, whereby experts collaborate across disciplinary boundaries, to a transdisciplinary approach that integrates society and science by including all stakeholders (5, 7, 8). This transcends traditional boundaries, and integrates knowledge and perspectives from scientific and non-scientific sources (9, 10). Many communities involved in health issues have proposed transdisciplinary and systemic approaches with different focuses, such as Ecohealth, Global Health, Planetary Health, or Health in scaled Social–Ecological Systems (7, 8). While there is considerable literature describing what integrated approaches to health could be, there are no recognized guidelines—to our knowledge—on how to evaluate to what extent the underlying integration as a principle and approach contributes to constructive management of complex health problems, such as antibiotic resistance or outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus disease. OH emphasizes the commonalities of human, animal, plant, and environmental health. In this perspective, it can be regarded as an “umbrella” term that captures integrative approaches to health across these highly interlinked components (4, 11). Due to the existing, historically contingent, organization of societies and disciplines, and the sectoral allocation of resources, developing integrated approaches is difficult, and benefits can be delayed. There is thus a need to provide evidence on the added value of OH to governments, researchers, funding bodies, and stakeholders (5, 12) and to explore how to evaluate integrated approaches to health. The Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH)1 is an initiative funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology that aims to address this by developing a framework and protocols for the evaluation of OH initiatives and by providing examples of their application.\",\r\n        \"The purpose of this paper is to identify and describe evaluable characteristics of OH approaches, and to present what they can encompass and achieve. This provides a basis for evaluation of OH initiatives and their outcomes, which could not be achieved using standard, sectoral approaches.\",\r\n        \"Factors identified as drivers (Figure 1) define the need for change toward OH approaches, based on a collective perception of a given problem. Such shared awareness reflects the multiple and complex drivers behind health problems. In reference to the social determinants of health identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) commission (13), social drivers for integrated approaches include lack of participation, cohesion, and welfare, as well as the presence of ignorance, poverty, poor governance, inequality, violence, mental and physical illness, or high risks for these. Environmental drivers include climate change, land degradation, reduced biodiversity, and ecosystem changes rooted in both natural phenomena and human actions. Economic drivers are mostly related to the globalization process, dominated by market deregulation and financial capital, and largely irrespective of social needs at the local level (14, 15). In this context, the capacity of nations to support public health services and welfare has been progressively eroded and the increasingly scarce resources require enhancement of inter-sectoral synergies, establishment of adequate governance structures, and effective achievement of multiple outcomes simultaneously. Human, animal, and plant populations are affected in many different ways by this process, potentially further widening the gap in human’s access to health and welfare. These examples are by no means exhaustive, and there is clearly an interplay between different drivers. For example, globalized trade agreements may lead to land acquisition by large multinational companies, thereby creating land shortages for local populations who are pushed to intensified extraction of available natural resources. Increased poverty in conjunction with close contact to previously unexploited environments puts human and animal health at risk (16). At the same time, economic crises and financial deregulation reduce public resources for interventions, thereby reinforcing negative environmental, economic, and social drivers and exacerbating negative health outcomes (17).\",\r\n        \"Although OH initiatives can range from development projects to educational programs, research projects, and intergovernmental strategies, they often have specific operating principles, characterized by a way of thinking, planning, and working. We selected this classification, as it represents a sequence from abstract thoughts over planning of an initiative to concrete implementation. The realization that certain health and welfare challenges cannot be dealt with from a single disciplinary perspective thus calls for a re-evaluation of approaches to deal with health and welfare challenges. “OH thinking” is holistic, inclusive, respectful, and tolerant, as opposed to approaches that are specific, reductionist, with a tendency to focus on single or limited outcomes that impact positively on few people only. It considers multiple scales of life, disciplines, sectors, species, paradigms, and demographics, and integrates at different spatial scales (e.g., locally, nationally, and globally). This should reflect the connected nature of social relations and social systems, both in their material and symbolic dimensions as well as the degradation of national resources due to globalization (18). “OH planning” requires that aims, problem formulation, responsibilities, and financing are organized, regardless of organizational hierarchies, paradigms, sectors, and disciplines. Most fundamentally, it necessitates clarity in establishing roles, tasks, responsibilities, and competencies (including leadership, power, and authority) within the specific OH initiative. OH aims to identify acceptable and manageable solutions to problems within a given context. Only after establishing a consensus, it (OH) can work and responsibilities be effectively allocated within the system.\",\r\n        \"Consequently, “OH working” relies on transdisciplinary collaboration that embraces contributions from the biological, natural and social sciences, and actively includes stakeholders in the process, from problem definitions to resolution. To operate as conceived, OH must rely on adequate information infrastructure and foster learning across all scales and fields (19). A learning framework allows for stakeholders and institutions to evolve and improve autonomously, and requires mechanisms for knowledge exchange, institutional memory, feedback, and regulation. This relies on sharing of knowledge, data, resources, and staff across sectors and disciplines. This working paradigm will often lead to complex, polycentric organizational structures that support development toward sustainability and resilience (20). To succeed, they rely on multiple, strong connections and coordinated activities across sectors, for example, joint health services for humans and animals (21, 22), and/or for the environment (23).\",\r\n        \"The expected outcomes of OH initiatives are health and welfare of humans, animals, plants, and ecosystems, all managed by common health strategies. This ensures healthy food, as well as clean water and air. Transdisciplinarity should result in improved stewardship and compliance, and promote interspecies equity, which would facilitate sustainable benefits for humans from other species (domestic and wild) and their habitats. Furthermore, OH should improve effectiveness across different sectors and at multiple scales. It relies on and results in more efficient communication, thereby generating a higher degree of awareness that can enable rapid detection of illness and consequent action. By having a more inclusive voice for neglected human populations, animals, and environment, OH is intended to widen our usual anthropocentric perspectives and to simultaneously enhance human health. The expected outcomes of OH approaches contribute to the three pillars of sustainability, namely, society, environment, and economy. In this way, the approach can be an instrument to working toward the UN sustainable development goals.2 Overall, OH is expected to result in the consideration of long-term effects of policy decisions, resilience at various scales, food and feed security, and ultimately sustainable lifestyles.\",\r\n        \"Most diseases identified by WHO in their global burden of disease analysis,3 from neglected zoonotic and tropical diseases to lifestyle diseases (e.g., depression, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, and malnutrition) are derived, to some degree, from the social–ecological system in which they occur. Many isolated disciplinary or sectoral approaches to deal with these health challenges have proven ineffective, either not durable or associated with economic and/or environmental damage (4, 7). The change of focus from disease to health across species, ecosystems, and scales constitutes an effective model to address these challenges. This model extends from cells, through individuals, populations to global systems and across different time scales (4). Some propose considering health beyond health, i.e., the global economic, political, and cultural context, where, for example, the changing patterns of emerging diseases in Africa or Asia may be caused by investment strategies at the New York, London, and Hong Kong stock exchanges (17, 24).\",\r\n        \"As demonstrated by the global AIDS response, this inclusive governance challenges current global norms, calls for global accountability, and reveals inextricable links between health, human rights, and social, economic, and political empowerment (25). By formulating apparently distant threats, such as climate change or soil erosion, from a health perspective, legal or economic actions may be accelerated, thereby leading to political decisions (6), through the willingness to accept trade-offs. Many health decisions are linked to dilemmas between scales, namely, individual versus social or global ecological interests. The solution lies in a continuous process of negotiation that includes all stakeholders and results in benefits from the interaction between different sectors (26). OH acknowledges that people’s choices are made within a context of economic, social, and cultural values.\",\r\n        \"Such a change in approach requires resources. Consequently, it is important to demonstrate common interests of economic, environmental, social, and health advocates to provide appropriate funding, albeit under challenging economic constraints (6). We identified clear parallels between OH and the concept of sustainability with its three pillars, i.e., society, environment, and economy. On this basis, the added value of OH as compared to single sector approaches can be assessed through monitoring aspects in these three pillars. For example, the social dimension may be monitored by examining the acceptability of interventions, the contribution to enhancing human capital, supporting solidarity, maintaining equity, diversity, participation, interconnectedness and partnerships, democracy, and political alignment and their adaptations to the relevant social–ecological context. The environmental dimension may be monitored using fresh-water quality, ocean quality, air and soil quality, biodiversity, species-specific health, and the overlap with ecosystem services. Finally, the economic dimension can be assessed by estimating the costs and the benefits of interventions to the widest possible extent, including not only the values that can be directly appraised through market prices but also the values of non-market goods and resources, which mostly depend on environmental and social achievements and are of particular importance for human and animal health and welfare.\",\r\n        \"To achieve systemic and scaled resilience to health challenges, the ultimate task for policy makers and other health professionals is to endorse health of people, animals, plants, and the environment and to achieve equitable and sustainable health outcomes (27, 28). To implement the concept of OH, “OH thinking,” “planning,” and “working” promote equity beyond health services and keep health (human, animal, and environmental) as the central focus (1, 2). Resilience in human and animal population health has clear benefits for the environment and the economy, at both national and global levels. Additionally, maintaining health is more ethical than facilitating recovery from illness (27). In many cases, isolated policies have contributed to ineffective responses to (emerging) infectious and non-communicable diseases. Health is essential for societal well-being, and many current health challenges are beyond the capacity of any one discipline or jurisdiction to meet. We need to embrace this and facilitate appropriate and sustained responses. For example, the emergence of infectious diseases, including zoonoses, and multidrug resistance is determined by variables including economic conditions, population changes (both humans and animals), and land use changes (29, 30). The consequences include changes in behavior and habits, as well as in intensification of production, trade, habitat change, loss of biodiversity, and globalization (24, 31). These in turn affect the economic conditions, population numbers, and land use, which emphasizes the co-evolutionary nature of these interactions. The long history of cohabitation between humans and animals suggests multiple synergistic effects. However, current trends lead to segregation of species in isolated habitats with complete loss of these synergies. The OH concept can shape this cohabitation, in a positive way, rather than being driven by fear and rejection. Ideas such as zoobiquity explore how animal–human commonalities can be used to diagnose, treat, and heal patients of all species, not just humans (32). The current challenge is to shape national, regional, and global institutions to facilitate these transdisciplinary processes and to provide methods to assess their level of integration as well as the evolution of the affected system. Health professionals have previously been at the forefront of social change, gradually making smoking and poor dietary habits increasingly unacceptable (6). It is now time to advocate for continuous adaptation of the underlying determinants of health, in particular interspecies equity, stewardship, and resilience to achieve a healthy and sustainable future for all.\",\r\n        \"The article is the result of a workshop.

Mosquitoes transmitting DENV in humans has been a major cause of dengue diseases in tropical and subtropical counties; approximately one-third of the world's population is at risk of the infection. People infected with DENV typically show self-limited febrile dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is more likely to occur after a second DENV infection [1], [2]. Other than supportive treatments, no specific therapy is available for dengue-related diseases. Several tetravalent DENV vaccine candidates are under development, but an effective, safe and affordable dengue vaccine remains elusive [3].\",\r\n        \"DENV infects multiple organs and cell types in humans. Particularly, the mononuclear phagocyte lineage of macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and skin Langerhans cells are the primary cell targets [4], [5], [6]. Similar cellular tropism of macrophages and DCs was observed in the experimental DENV mouse infection model [7]. Macrophages and DCs are the most crucial cell types in innate immunity and rapidly produce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to fight against microbe invasion. Type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of virus replication. Therefore, many pathogenic viruses have developed strategies to escape the IFN-triggered anti-viral effects. More than 170 different virus-encoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described [8]. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, an IFN stimulator, with its protease NS3/4A [9]. The nonstructural proteins NS4B of DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) block the activation of STAT1 in cells stimulated with type I IFN [10], [11].\",\r\n        \"We previously found that two flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and DENV-2, trigger type I IFN transcription through an RIG-I-dependent signaling cascade to activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF) and NF-κB. However, JEV induced higher activation of IRF3 and NF-κB than DENV-2 in human A549 cells [12]. Furthermore, type I IFN production triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stimulation was blocked in DENV-2-infected human DCs [13], [14]. Microarray results from rhesus macaques also indicated that type I IFN, interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were not upregulated with DENV-1 infection [15]. Therefore, DENV-2 might modulate the induction pathway of type I IFN and other cytokines.\",\r\n        \"The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family is one of the best-studied pattern-recognition receptor families and is responsible for sensing invading pathogens [16]. Different TLRs recognize the different molecular patterns of microorganisms; for example, TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TLR3 recognizes dsRNA. Engagement of TLRs with their ligands triggers signal cascades to activate IRFs and NF-κB, thus leading to production of cytokines and type I IFN [17]. NF-κB activation is crucial for cytokine induction, and many viruses evolve various strategies to manipulate NF-κB signaling [18], [19]. Several RNA virus-encoded proteins, such as HCV NS5B, SARS CoV M protein, measles virus V protein, and enterovirus 71 2C, inhibit NF-κB activation directly or indirectly [20], [21], [22], [23].\",\r\n        \"In this study, we investigated whether DENV-2 could block type I IFN and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. We studied the influence of DENV-2 infection on activation of NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).\",\r\n        \"The DENV-2 PL046 strain (Genbank accession: AJ968413.1) was isolated from a Taiwanese DF patient.

Harvested cell extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were reacted with primary antibody, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and visualized with an enhance chemiluminescence system (Thermo). Images were acquired by a digital image system (UVP or Fujifilm).\",\r\n        \"To study the effect of DENV-2 on modulating innate immune response, we determined the levels of type I IFN and cytokines in DENV-2–infected mouse BMDCs by quantitative RT-PCR. The TLR3 ligand polyI:C and the TLR9 ligand CpG greatly stimulated the mRNA expression of IFN-β (124-fold induction at 2 h by polyI:C and 531-fold induction at 6 h by CpG), IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG), IL-12p40 (381-fold at 24 h by polyI:C and 1551-fold at 6 h by CpG), and TNFα (64-fold at 2 h by polyI:C and 180-fold at 6 h by CpG) (Figure 1A–D, left panels). However, levels of IFN-β and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1, left and right panels): especially, IL-10 was not induced by DENV-2 infection. The kinetic of DENV-2 replication in BMDCs was measured by qPCR with primers specific for DENV-2 5′-UTR (Figure 1E) and by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure 1F). DENV-2 replication peaked around 12–24 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12–36 h post infection. Therefore, infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression and that of other cytokines. Since DENV-2 infection would produce intracellular viral RNA to turn on RLR and TLR signaling cascades for cytokine production, weak induction of DENV-2 for these cytokine genes (Figure 1) implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines.\",\r\n        \"To determine whether DENV infection could suppress the cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling, we investigated infection with a murine macrophage cell line J774A.1. Consistent with previous report that J774A.1 is susceptible to DENV infection [27], DENV-2 infection in J774A.1 was shown by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 (Figure S1A), and by qPCR with DENV-2 5′ UTR primers (Figure S1B). J774A.1 cells were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2, then stimulated with LPS or polyI:C. LPS and polyI:C readily promoted the expression of IFN-β (Figure 2A and B; left panels) and IL-10 (Figure 2A and B right panels), but with DENV-2, the expression was diminished. Similar results were noticed in DENV-2-infected BMDCs that polyI:C-activated IFN-β and IL-10 were reduced with DENV-2 infection (Figure 2C). Thus, DENV-2 appears to interfere with IFN-β and cytokine production triggered by TLRs signaling cascade.\",\r\n        \"NF-κB is an essential molecule in the TLR signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN-β and cytokines [16], [28], [29]. In our infection system, two strains of DENV-2, PL046 and NGC, triggered low degree of NFκB p65 nuclear translocation. Nuclear staining of p65 was noted in 7% and 13% of PL046- and NGC-infected cells, respectively (Figure S2A panels b and c); in contrast, about 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-κB p65 (Figure S2A, panel d). Thus, we checked whether DENV-2 could suppress NF-κB activation triggered by TLRs engagement. With use of a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, NF-κB activation stimulated by the TLR ligands LPS and polyI:C was readily blocked in DENV-2-infected cells at 12 and 24 h post stimulation (Figure 3A). Immunoblotting result of DENV-2 NS3 indicated that the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment (Figure 3B). As well, DENV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-κB activation in Vero cells as measured by nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 (Figure 4A); similar results were also observed in J774A.1 macrophages (Figure S2B). Nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was slightly increased in A549 cells up to 60 h post DENV-2 infection, but the polyI:C-triggered p65 nuclear translocation was greatly blocked in DENV-2 infected cells (Figure S2C). We also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication, polyI:C pretreatment blocked DENV-2 replication; whereas, the antiviral effect of polyI:C was not seen in cells with established DENV-2 infection (Figure 4B). This data is consistent with previous report [30] and suggest that DENV-2 inhibits TLR signaling to benefit its replication. DENV-2 replication in these two cell lines, A549 and Vero, was confirmed by qPCR with viral 5′ UTR primers and plaque assay for virion production (Figure S3). Thus, DENV-2 downregulates TLR-activated NF-κB, which leads to reduced cytokine expression.\",\r\n        \"The activity of ERK is associated with the expression of type I IFN and cytokines, particularly IL-10 [31], [32], [33]. We thus further checked whether DENV-2 targets ERK activation by examining the phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK). DENV-2 infection did not activate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and even impaired the basal level of p-ERK1/2 (Figure 5A). Furthermore, polyI:C- and LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was decreased with DENV-2 infection (Figure 5B and 5C), so DENV blocks TLR-mediated ERK activation to modulate both arms of the innate immunity response to infection: type I IFN and cytokines.\",\r\n        \"The pathogenesis mechanism of severe DHF/DSS with DENV infection is not well understood, but evidence suggests that the magnitude of DENV replication and its regulation of innate and adaptive immunity may both contribute [34]. The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1]. Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35], [36], [37]. In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNFα were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2-infected BMDCs. Furthermore, even in the absence of enhancing antibody, DENV could block NF-κB activation and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. Downregulation of the cytokine system may provide a growth advantage for DENV to propagate in host macrophages and DCs.\",\r\n        \"IL-10 is a potent immunosuppressor produced by several immune cells [38], and its expression can be triggered by TLR [31], [32]. IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions caused by the host immune system responding to infections [39], [40]. DHF patients showed high serum levels of IL-10, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [41], [42]. In a WNV animal infection model, IL-10 downregulated T cell-mediated immunity and had a negative role in antiviral immunity [43]. Thus, our findings that DENV-2 failed to induce IL-10 expression in BMDCs (Figure 1) are unexpected but are consistent with previous reports that IL-10 is not produced from mature human CD1a+ DCs infected with DENV-2 [44], [45] and that microarray data from DENV-1-infected rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes [15]. In addition, we found that DENV-2 could inhibit TLR-triggered IL-10 expression. Therefore, the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be simply stimulated by the DENV itself. Instead, it may be resulted from uncontrolled DENV replication, which then triggers increased levels of immune activation and increased IL-10 production. DENV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system and results in increased DENV production [35], [37], [45]. Thus, DENV infection via ADE or non-ADE routes might have different effects in the immune system.\",\r\n        \"TLR signaling cascades are mainly controlled by the MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways, which both lead to activation of NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [17], [46]. NF-κB and MAPKs have been suggested to have critical roles in cytokine induction [47], [48]. A recent study showed that constitutive intestinal NF-κB activation does not lead to destructive inflammation unless accompanied by activation of MAPKs such as p38 and ERK [49]. Our results that DENV-2 blocked activation of NF-κB, as well as ERK1/2, support our findings of cytokine production hampered in DENV-2-infected cells. Because both NFκB and ERK1/2 were affected, DENV may suppress an upstream molecular event such as TLR gene expression, as that has been reported for DENV infection through an ADE route [37]. We also detected TLR genes expression in DENV-2 infected J774A.1 macrophages and found that polyI:C-triggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2 (Figure S4, panels a–c), but not for that of TRL6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR2 (Figure S4, panels d–g). In contrast, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation (Figure S4, panels h–i), suggesting that DENV-2 may modulate certain TLR genes expression in macrophage. Other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN-β promoter activation [13], may target common molecules involved in type I IFN and cytokine production in TLR signaling, or whether ISG15 that is induced by DENV-2 and functions as an inhibitor of type I IFN production [50] may also contribute to immune evasion, remain to be further studied.\",\r\n        \"Taiwanese DENV-2 strain PL046 used in this study was isolated from patient with DF, and this virus has been used in the studies of viral pathogenesis and host responses mechanism in vitro and in vivo\\n[7], [12], [51], [52], [53]. Other groups have reported that DENV-2 strains MON601 (a laboratory strain of NGC) and 16681 downregulate the activation of NF-κB and production of type I IFN and TNFα in human DC, macrophage, and Huh7 cells [14], [54]. A recent report by Chase A. J. et al. [55] also revealed that human DCs infected with several endemic DENV-2 strains failed to polarize the naïve CD4+ T cells to effectors, suggesting a defect on T cell priming for DENV-infected DCs [55]. However, one of the strain ARA6894 did not show such kind of inhibition effect, as ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4+ Th1 polarization with high expression of IFNγ and TNFα. Interestingly, the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains such as PL046, 16681 and NGC [55], suggesting that different impacts on DC's function between these DENV-2 strains might be due to viral genome diversity.\",\r\n        \"Dengue may be the most important arboviral disease potentially affecting 2 to 3 billion people living in tropical and subtropical areas. DENV mainly infects monocytes, macrophages and DCs that are also the most important innate immune cells. The balance between the protective and pathological immune responses likely contributes to the DENV infection outcomes. Our results demonstrating that DENV can modulate the signaling events triggered by several TLRs are of interest and provide an explanation for how DENV may skew the host immune system.\"\r\n      ],\r\n      tags: { sciwingI2B2: {} }\r\n    },\r\n    url: \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3425550/\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    paper_id: \"PMC7202825\",\r\n    doi: \"10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.016\",\r\n    title: \"Emergent hospital reform in response to outbreak of COVID-19\",\r\n    doc_date: \"2020-05-06\",\r\n    authors: [\r\n      \"Jingwen.Li\",\r\n      \"Qing.Zhang\",\r\n      \"Xi.Fang\",\r\n      \"Na.Li\",\r\n      \"Caiying.Hu\",\r\n      \"Zhicheng.Lin\",\r\n      \"Nian.Xiong\"\r\n    ],\r\n    summary: \"\",\r\n    abstract: { text: [], tags: { sciwing: [] } },\r\n    bodyText: {\r\n      section_header: {\r\n        original: [\r\n          \"Author Contributions\",\r\n          \"Funding\",\r\n          \"Declaration of Competing Interest\",\r\n          \"Uncited reference\"\r\n        ],\r\n        generic: [\"related-works\", \"related-works\", \"conclusions\", \"method\"]\r\n      },\r\n      text: [\r\n        \"JL, XF and QZ drafted the manuscript and share first authorship.
